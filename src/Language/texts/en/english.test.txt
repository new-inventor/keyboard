Pride and Prejudice
Jane Austen 

Chapter 1
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. 
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters. 
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?" 
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. 
"But it is, returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it. 
Mr. Bennet made no answer. 
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently. 
"YOU want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it." 
This was invitation enough. 
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week." 
"What is his name?" 
"Bingley." 
"Is he married or single?" 
"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!" 
"How so? How can it affect them?" 
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them." 
"Is that his design in settling here?" 
"Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he MAY fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes." 
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party." 
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly HAVE had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty." 
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of." 
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood." 
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you." 
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for US to visit him if you do not." 
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy." 
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving HER the preference." 
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters." 
"Mr. Bennet, how CAN you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves." 
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least." 
Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. HER mind was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news. 
Chapter 2
Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with: 
"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy." 
"We are not in a way to know WHAT Mr. Bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit." 
"But you forget, mamma," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him." 
"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her." 
"No more have I," said Mr. Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you." 
Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters. 
"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces." 
"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times them ill." 
"I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully. "When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?" 
"To-morrow fortnight." 
"Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself." 
"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to HER." 
"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?" 
"I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. But if WE do not venture somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her daughters must stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself." 
The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, "Nonsense, nonsense!" 
"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he. "Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you THERE. What say you, Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts." 
Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how. 
"While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr. Bingley." 
"I am sick of Mr. Bingley," cried his wife. 
"I am sorry to hear THAT; but why did not you tell me that before? If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now." 
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while. 
"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now." 
"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose," said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife. 
What an excellent father you have, girls!" said she, when the door was shut. "I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you ARE the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball." 
"Oh!" said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I AM the youngest, I'm the tallest." 
The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner. 
Chapter 3
Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in various waysï¿½with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained. 
"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield," said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for." 
In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse. 
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from Londonï¿½his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogetherï¿½Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man. 
Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend. 
Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters. 
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it. 
"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance." 
"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with." 
"I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Mr. Bingley, "for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty." 
"YOU are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet. 
"Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you." 
"Which do you mean?" and turning round he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said: "She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt ME; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me." 
Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous. 
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the events of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear. 
"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice! Only think of THAT, my dear; he actually danced with her twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the BOULANGERï¿½" 
"If he had had any compassion for ME," cried her husband impatiently, "he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of his partners. O that he had sprained his ankle in the first place!" 
"Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst's gownï¿½" 
Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy. 
"But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting HIS fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man." 
Chapter 4
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very much she admired him. 
"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!ï¿½so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!" 
"He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete." 
"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I did not expect such a compliment." 
"Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between us. Compliments always take YOU by surprise, and ME never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person." 
"Dear Lizzy!" 
"Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life." 
"I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak what I think." 
"I know you do; and it is THAT which makes the wonder. With YOUR good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enoughï¿½one meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or designï¿½to take the good of everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothing of the badï¿½belongs to you alone. And so you like this man's sisters, too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his." 
"Certainly notï¿½at first. But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her." 
Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade. 
Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase. 
His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but, though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his tableï¿½nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for half-an-hourï¿½was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately. 
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense. 
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much. 
Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be soï¿½but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose. 
Chapter 5
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him courteous. 
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth's intimate friend. 
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate. 
"YOU began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs. Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas. "YOU were Mr. Bingley's first choice." 
"Yes; but he seemed to like his second better." 
"Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be sure that DID seem as if he admired herï¿½indeed I rather believe he DIDï¿½I heard something about itï¿½but I hardly know whatï¿½something about Mr. Robinson." 
"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and WHICH he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question: 'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'" 
"Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeedï¿½that does seem as ifï¿½but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know." 
"MY overhearings were more to the purpose than YOURS, Eliza," said Charlotte. "Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?ï¿½poor Eliza!ï¿½to be only just TOLERABLE." 
"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips." 
"Are you quite sure, ma'am?ï¿½is not there a little mistake?" said Jane. "I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her." 
"Ayeï¿½because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to." 
"Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much, unless among his intimate acquaintances. With THEM he is remarkably agreeable." 
"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise." 
"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I wish he had danced with Eliza." 
"Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with HIM, if I were you." 
"I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you NEVER to dance with him." 
"His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend ME so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a RIGHT to be proud." 
"That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive HIS pride, if he had not mortified MINE." 
"Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, "is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us." 
"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy," cried a young Lucas, who came with his sisters, "I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day." 
"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said Mrs. Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle directly." 
The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit. 
Chapter 6
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with THEM was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It was generally evident whenever they met, that he DID admire her and to HER it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas. 
"It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all BEGIN freelyï¿½a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show MORE affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on." 
"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to discover it too." 
"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do." 
"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out." 
"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses." 
"Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite enough to make her understand his character." 
"Not as you represent it. Had she merely DINED with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent togetherï¿½and four evenings may do a great deal." 
"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded." 
"Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life." 
"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself." 
Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with. 
He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were assembled. 
"What does Mr. Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?" 
"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer." 
"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him." 
On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said: 
"Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?" 
"With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady energetic." 
"You are severe on us." 
"It will be HER turn soon to be teased," said Miss Lucas. "I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows." 
"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!ï¿½always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers." On Miss Lucas's persevering, however, she added, "Very well, if it must be so, it must." And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar with: 'Keep your breath to cool your porridge'; and I shall keep mine to swell my song." 
Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display. 
Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who, with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room. 
Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began: 
"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished society." 
"Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance." 
Sir William only smiled. "Your friend performs delightfully," he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; "and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy." 
"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir." 
"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do you often dance at St. James's?" 
"Never, sir." 
"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?" 
"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it." 
"You have a house in town, I conclude?" 
Mr. Darcy bowed. 
"I had once had some thought of fixing in town myselfï¿½for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas." 
He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her: 
"My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you." And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William: 
"Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner." 
Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion. 
"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half-hour." 
"Mr. Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling. 
"He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisanceï¿½for who would object to such a partner?" 
Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley: 
"I can guess the subject of your reverie." 
"I should imagine not." 
"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this mannerï¿½in such society; and indeed I am quite of you opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noiseï¿½the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!" 
"You conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow." 
Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity: 
"Miss Elizabeth Bennet." 
"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley. "I am all astonishment. How long has she been such a favourite?ï¿½and pray, when am I to wish you joy?" 
"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy." 
"Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is absolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed; and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you." 
He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long. 
Chapter 7
Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds. 
She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade. 
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters. 
Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign. 
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr. Bennet coolly observed: 
"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced." 
Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London. 
"I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "that you should be so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly of anybody's children, it should not be of my own, however." 
"If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it." 
"Yesï¿½but as it happens, they are all of them very clever." 
"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish." 
"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very wellï¿½and, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals." 
"Mamma," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library." 
Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read, 
"Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love." 
"It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud. 
"MY DEAR FRIEND,ï¿½ 
"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a whole day's tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.ï¿½Yours ever, 
"CAROLINE BINGLEY" 
"With the officers!" cried Lydia. "I wonder my aunt did not tell us of THAT." 
"Dining out," said Mrs. Bennet, "that is very unlucky." 
"Can I have the carriage?" said Jane. 
"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night." 
"That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home." 
"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton, and the Hursts have no horses to theirs." 
"I had much rather go in the coach." 
"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?" 
"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them." 
"But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose will be answered." 
She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not some back. 
"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs. Bennet more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth: 
"MY DEAREST LIZZY,ï¿½ 
"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jonesï¿½therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to meï¿½and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the matter with me.ï¿½Yours, etc." 
"Well, my dear," said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illnessï¿½if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders." 
"Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is all very well. I would go an see her if I could have the carriage." 
Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking was her only alternative. She declared her resolution. 
"How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there." 
"I shall be very fit to see Janeï¿½which is all I want." 
"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the horses?" 
"No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner." 
"I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required." 
"We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and Lydia. Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together. 
"If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes." 
In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise. 
She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise. That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was thinking only of his breakfast. 
Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her. 
When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in fact, nothing to do elsewhere. 
When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes. 
Chapter 8
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike. 
Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her. 
When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added: 
"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really looked almost wild." 
"She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must SHE be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!" 
"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office." 
"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; "but this was all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice." 
"YOU observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley; "and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see YOUR sister make such an exhibition." 
"Certainly not." 
"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to decorum." 
"It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said Bingley. 
"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy," observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, "that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes." 
"Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise." A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again: 
"I have a excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it." 
"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney on Meryton." 
"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside." 
"That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily. 
"If they had uncles enough to fill ALL Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it would not make them one jot less agreeable." 
"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world," replied Darcy. 
To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations. 
With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee. She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment. 
"Do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rather singular." 
"Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards. She is a great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else." 
"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried Elizabeth; "I am NOT a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things." 
"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said Bingley; "and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well." 
Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her othersï¿½all that his library afforded. 
"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever looked into." 
Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room. 
"I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have left so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!" 
"It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many generations." 
"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books." 
"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these." 
"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place. Charles, when you build YOUR house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley." 
"I wish it may." 
"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire." 
"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it." 
"I am talking of possibilities, Charles." 
"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation." 
Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game." 
"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley; "will she be as tall as I am?" 
"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or rather taller." 
"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite." 
"It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are." 
"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?" 
"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished." 
"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished." 
"Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley. 
"Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman." 
"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it." 
"Oh! certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half-deserved." 
"All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading." 
"I am no longer surprised at your knowing ONLY six accomplished women. I rather wonder now at your knowing ANY." 
"Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this? 
"I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united." 
Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room. 
"Elizabeth Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art." 
"Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, "there is a meanness in ALL the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable." 
Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject. 
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister. 
Chapter 9
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast. 
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She would not listen, therefore, to her daughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughter all attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected. 
"Indeed I have, sir," was her answer. "She is a great deal too ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass a little longer on your kindness." 
"Removed!" cried Bingley. "It must not be thought of. My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal." 
"You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, "that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with us." 
Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgements. 
"I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to HER. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease." 
"Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here." 
"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said Elizabeth. 
"You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her. 
"Oh! yesï¿½I understand you perfectly." 
"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful." 
"That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours." 
"Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home." 
"I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that your were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study." 
"Yes, but intricate characters are the MOST amusing. They have at least that advantage." 
"The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but a few subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society." 
"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever." 
"Yes, indeed," cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood. "I assure you there is quite as much of THAT going on in the country as in town." 
Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph. 
"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?" 
"When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either." 
"Ayeï¿½that is because you have the right disposition. But that gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing at all." 
"Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother. "You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be true." 
"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families." 
Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since HER coming away. 
"Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So genteel and easy! He had always something to say to everybody. THAT is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter." 
"Did Charlotte dine with you?" 
"No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work; MY daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think Charlotte so VERY plainï¿½but then she is our particular friend." 
"She seems a very pleasant young woman." 
"Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Janeï¿½one does not often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother Gardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were." 
"And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently. "There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!" 
"I have been used to consider poetry as the FOOD of love," said Darcy. 
"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away." 
Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield. 
Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners, and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear: 
"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill." 
Lydia declared herself satisfied. "Oh! yesï¿½it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you have given YOUR ball," she added, "I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not." 
Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of HER, in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on FINE EYES. 
Chapter 10
The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear. Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game. 
Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in union with her opinion of each. 
"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!" 
He made no answer. 
"You write uncommonly fast." 
"You are mistaken. I write rather slowly." 
"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!" 
"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours." 
"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her." 
"I have already told her so once, by your desire." 
"I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend pens remarkably well." 
"Thank youï¿½but I always mend my own." 
"How can you contrive to write so even?" 
He was silent. 
"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's." 
"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At present I have not room to do them justice." 
"Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?" 
"They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me to determine." 
"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with ease, cannot write ill." 
"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her brother, "because he does NOT write with ease. He studies too much for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?" 
"My style of writing is very different from yours." 
"Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest." 
"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express themï¿½by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents." 
"Your humility, Mr. Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof." 
"Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast." 
"And which of the two do you call MY little recent piece of modesty?" 
"The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourselfï¿½and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?" 
"Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies." 
"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not goï¿½and at another word, might stay a month." 
"You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much more than he did himself." 
"I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could." 
"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?" 
"Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for himself." 
"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety." 
"To yield readilyï¿½easilyï¿½to the PERSUASION of a friend is no merit with you." 
"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either." 
"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?" 
"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?" 
"By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has nothing to do." 
Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense. 
"I see your design, Bingley," said his friend. "You dislike an argument, and want to silence this." 
"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me." 
"What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter." 
Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter. 
When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself. 
Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine, however, at last that she drew his notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked him too little to care for his approbation. 
After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her: 
"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?" 
She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence. 
"Oh!" said she, "I heard you before, but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at allï¿½and now despise me if you dare." 
"Indeed I do not dare." 
Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger. 
Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth. 
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance. 
"I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do sure the younger girls of running after officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses." 
"Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?" 
"Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different lines. As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?" 
"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied." 
At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth herself. 
"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard. 
"You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs. Hurst, "running away without telling us that you were coming out." 
Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness, and immediately said: 
"This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the avenue." 
But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered: 
"No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good-bye." 
She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening. 
Chapter 11
When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit. 
But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object; Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight. 
When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-tableï¿½but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet. 
Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy's progress through HIS book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library." 
No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said: 
"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure." 
"If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chooses, before it beginsï¿½but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send round my cards." 
"I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the day." 
"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball." 
Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said: 
"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude." 
Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere. "What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his meaning?"ï¿½and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him? 
"Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it." 
Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives. 
"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak. "You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire." 
"Oh! shocking!" cried Miss Bingley. "I never heard anything so abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?" 
"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth. "We can all plague and punish one another. Tease himï¿½laugh at him. Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done." 
"But upon my honour, I do NOT. I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me THAT. Tease calmness of manner and presence of mind! No, noï¿½feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself." 
"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth. "That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to ME to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a laugh." 
"Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me more credit than can be. The wisest and the best of menï¿½nay, the wisest and best of their actionsï¿½may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke." 
"Certainly," replied Elizabethï¿½"there are such people, but I hope I am not one of THEM. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, DO divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without." 
"Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule." 
"Such as vanity and pride." 
"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But prideï¿½where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation." 
Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile. 
"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss Bingley; "and pray what is the result?" 
"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it himself without disguise." 
"No," said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little yieldingï¿½certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of other so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost forever." 
"THAT is a failing indeed!" cried Elizabeth. "Implacable resentment IS a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I really cannot LAUGH at it. You are safe from me." 
"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evilï¿½a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome." 
"And YOUR defect is to hate everybody." 
"And yours," he replied with a smile, "is willfully to misunderstand them." 
"Do let us have a little music," cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share. "Louisa, you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst?" 
Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was opened; and Darcy, after a few moments' recollection, was not sorry for it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention. 
Chapter 12
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolvedï¿½nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made. 
The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other. 
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for herï¿½that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right. 
To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligenceï¿½Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he likedï¿½and Miss Bingley was uncivil to HER, and more teasing than usual to himself. He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should NOW escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her. 
On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place. Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest of spirits. 
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth. 
They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that colonel Foster was going to be married. 
Chapter 13
"I hope, my dear," said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party." 
"Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call inï¿½and I hope MY dinners are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home." 
"The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger." 
Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled. "A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr. Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley. Butï¿½good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bellï¿½I must speak to Hill this moment." 
"It is NOT Mr. Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life." 
This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once. 
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained: 
"About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases." 
"Oh! my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it." 
Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about. 
"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr. Bennet, "and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn. But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself." 
"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did before him?" 
"Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear." 
"Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October. 
"Dear Sir,ï¿½ 
"The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.ï¿½'There, Mrs. Bennet.'ï¿½My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within in the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amendsï¿½but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'ennight following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.ï¿½I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend, 
"WILLIAM COLLINS" 
"At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman," said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. "He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again." 
"There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him." 
"Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit." 
Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required. 
"He must be an oddity, I think," said she. "I cannot make him out.ï¿½There is something very pompous in his style.ï¿½And what can he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?ï¿½We cannot suppose he would help it if he could.ï¿½Could he be a sensible man, sir?" 
"No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him." 
"In point of composition," said Mary, "the letter does not seem defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed." 
To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters. 
Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily. 
"You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so oddly." 
"You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate." 
"Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with YOU, for such things I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed." 
"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquaintedï¿½" 
He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collin's admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised; and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour. 
Chapter 14
During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that "he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rankï¿½such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but HE had never seen anything but affability in her. She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herselfï¿½some shelves in the closet upstairs." 
"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs. Bennet, "and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?" 
"The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence." 
"I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?" 
"She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property." 
"Ah!" said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?" 
"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies." 
"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at court." 
"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornaments. Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay." 
"You judge very properly," said Mr. Bennet, "and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?" 
"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible." 
Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure. 
By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with: 
"Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town." 
Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said: 
"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin." 
Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon. 
Chapter 15
Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility. 
Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report. This was his plan of amendsï¿½of atonementï¿½for inheriting their father's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part. 
His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening SHE was his settled choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. "As to her YOUNGER daughters, she could not take upon her to sayï¿½she could not positively answerï¿½but she did not KNOW of any prepossession; her ELDEST daughter, she must just mentionï¿½she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged." 
Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabethï¿½and it was soon doneï¿½done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course. 
Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces. 
Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go. 
In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall them. 
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking with another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversationï¿½a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hatï¿½a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know. 
In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend. 
Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Phillip's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of Mrs. Phillips's throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation. 
Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop-boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him. She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the ï¿½ï¿½shire. She had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid, disagreeable fellows." Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless. 
As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister. 
Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Phillips's manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life. 
Chapter 16
As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house. 
When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietorï¿½when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room. 
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however. The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The officers of the ï¿½ï¿½shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as THEY were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room. 
Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker. 
With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist. 
"I know little of the game at present," said he, "but I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation in lifeï¿½" Mrs. Phillips was very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason. 
Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be toldï¿½the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there. 
"About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, "He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I understand." 
"Yes," replied Mr. Wickham; "his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy." 
Elizabeth could not but look surprised. 
"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?" 
"As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth very warmly. "I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable." 
"I have no right to give MY opinion," said Wickham, "as to his being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for ME to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonishï¿½and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else. Here you are in your own family." 
"Upon my word, I say no more HERE than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone." 
"I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with HIM I believe it does not often happen. The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen." 
"I should take him, even on MY slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man." Wickham only shook his head. 
"I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is likely to be in this country much longer." 
"I do not at all know; but I HEARD nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ï¿½ï¿½shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood." 
"Oh! noï¿½it is not for ME to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If HE wishes to avoid seeing ME, he must go. We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for avoiding HIM but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father." 
Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry. 
Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible gallantry. 
"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added, "which was my chief inducement to enter the ï¿½ï¿½shire. I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them. Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude. I MUST have employment and society. A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible. The church OUGHT to have been my professionï¿½I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now." 
"Indeed!" 
"Yesï¿½the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me. I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere." 
"Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but how could THAT be? How could his will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?" 
"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt itï¿½or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudenceï¿½in short anything or nothing. Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may have spoken my opinion OF him, and TO him, too freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me." 
"This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced." 
"Some time or other he WILL beï¿½but it shall not be by ME. Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose HIM." 
Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them. 
"But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive? What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?" 
"A thorough, determined dislike of meï¿½a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stoodï¿½the sort of preference which was often given me." 
"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as thisï¿½though I have never liked him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this." 
After a few minutes' reflection, however, she continued, "I DO remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must be dreadful." 
"I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham; "I can hardly be just to him." 
Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father!" She could have added, "A young man, too, like YOU, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable"ï¿½but she contented herself with, "and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!" 
"We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. MY father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit toï¿½but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendence, and when, immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to HIM, as of his affection to myself." 
"How strange!" cried Elizabeth. "How abominable! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonestï¿½for dishonesty I must call it." 
"It IS wonderful," replied Wickham, "for almost all his actions may be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride." 
"Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?" 
"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor. Family pride, and FILIAL prideï¿½for he is very proud of what his father wasï¿½have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also BROTHERLY pride, which, with SOME brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers." 
"What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?" 
He shook his head. "I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brotherï¿½very, very proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education." 
After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying: 
"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you know Mr. Bingley?" 
"Not at all." 
"He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is." 
"Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeableï¿½allowing something for fortune and figure." 
The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success was made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged that she would not make herself uneasy. 
"I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters." 
Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh. 
"Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long." 
"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy." 
"No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday." 
"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates." 
This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined for another. 
"Mr. Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman." 
"I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham; "I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class." 
Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham's attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House. 
Chapter 17
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The possibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained. 
"They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side." 
"Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business? Do clear THEM too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody." 
"Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? Oh! no." 
"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks." 
"It is difficult indeedï¿½it is distressing. One does not know what to think." 
"I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think." 
But Jane could think with certainty on only one pointï¿½that Mr. Bingley, if he HAD been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public. 
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities. 
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of her brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's look and behavior. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it. 
"While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enoughï¿½I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody." 
Elizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance. 
"I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her." 
Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help for it, however. Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins' proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first struck her, that SHE was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors. The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to HER. Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him. 
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought afterï¿½the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia. 
Chapter 18
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, "I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here." 
This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make. Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her. 
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from him was ecstasy. 
She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her: 
"I dare say you will find him very agreeable." 
"Heaven forbid! THAT would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find a man agreeable whom on is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an evil." 
When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time with:ï¿½"It is YOUR turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked about the dance, and YOU ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples." 
He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said. 
"Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But NOW we may be silent." 
"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?" 
"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of SOME, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible." 
"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?" 
"Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb." 
"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure," said he. "How near it may be to MINE, I cannot pretend to say. YOU think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly." 
"I must not decide on my own performance." 
He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance." 
The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, "Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his MAKING friendsï¿½whether he may be equally capable of RETAINING them, is less certain." 
"He has been so unlucky as to lose YOUR friendship," replied Elizabeth with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life." 
Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner. 
"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:ï¿½but let me not interrupt you, sir. You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me." 
The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said, "Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of." 
"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine." 
"What think you of books?" said he, smiling. 
"Booksï¿½oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings." 
"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions." 
"Noï¿½I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else." 
"The PRESENT always occupies you in such scenesï¿½does it?" said he, with a look of doubt. 
"Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that you resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its BEING CREATED." 
"I am," said he, with a firm voice. 
"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?" 
"I hope not." 
"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first. 
"May I ask to what these questions tend?" 
"Merely to the illustration of YOUR character," said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity. "I am trying to make it out." 
"And what is your success?" 
She shook her head. "I do not get on at all. I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly." 
"I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that reports may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either." 
"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity." 
"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied. She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another. 
They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her: 
"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham! Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really, considering his descent, one could not expect much better." 
"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of THAT, I can assure you, he informed me himself." 
"I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer. "Excuse my interferenceï¿½it was kindly meant." 
"Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself. "You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy." She then sought her eldest sister, who has undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness. 
"I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon." 
"No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister's, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard." 
"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?" 
"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton." 
"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am satisfied. But what does he say of the living?" 
"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him CONDITIONALLY only." 
"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly; "but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr. Bingley's defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before." 
She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery. 
"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology." 
"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!" 
"Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherine's NEPHEW. It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight." 
Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she ceased speaking, replied thus: 
"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdomï¿½provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself." And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology," "Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh." It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth. 
"I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him." 
As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it. 
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical. 
"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing HE may not like to hear." 
"For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing!" 
Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity. 
At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another. Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however, imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, "That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit." 
Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to. 
"If I," said Mr. Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tithes as a may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as a comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manner towards everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family." And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as a to be heard by half the room. Many staredï¿½many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man. 
To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as a much as a they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable. 
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room. He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself. 
She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's further notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it. 
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord, how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn. 
When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time. 
Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for HER, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield. 
Chapter 19
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words: 
"May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?" 
Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs. Bennet answered instantly, "Oh dear!ï¿½yesï¿½certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happyï¿½I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs." And, gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out: 
"Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am going away myself." 
"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are." And upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added: "Lizzy, I INSIST upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins." 
Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunctionï¿½and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began. 
"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there NOT been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected mother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marryingï¿½and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did." 
The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further, and he continued: 
"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdlyï¿½which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsfordï¿½between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for MY sake; and for your OWN, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes placeï¿½which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing remains but for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married." 
It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now. 
"You are too hasty, sir," she cried. "You forget that I have made no answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them." 
"I am not now to learn," replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long." 
"Upon my word, sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make ME happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation." 
"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr. Collins very gravelyï¿½"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification." 
"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing you hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled." And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus addressed her: 
"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character." 
"Really, Mr. Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one." 
"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females." 
"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart." 
"You are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable." 
To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behavior at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female. 
Chapter 20
Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect or their nearer connection. Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character. 
This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it, and could not help saying so. 
"But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins," she added, "that Lizzy shall be brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will MAKE her know it." 
"Pardon me for interrupting you, madam," cried Mr. Collins; "but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity." 
"Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. "Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure." 
She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library, "Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have HER." 
Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication. 
"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had finished her speech. "Of what are you talking?" 
"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy." 
"And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business." 
"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him." 
"Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion." 
Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library. 
"Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared. "I have sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?" Elizabeth replied that it was. "Very wellï¿½and this offer of marriage you have refused?" 
"I have, sir." 
"Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?" 
"Yes, or I will never see her again." 
"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again if you do NOT marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you DO." 
Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed. 
"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to INSIST upon her marrying him." 
"My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours to request. First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be." 
Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner varied, however, her determination never did. 
Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed. He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret. 
While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him." 
Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family. "Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone, "for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves." 
Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth. 
"Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs. Bennet, "looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzyï¿½if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at allï¿½and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep youï¿½and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied." 
Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, "Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation together." 
Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected conversation: "Oh! Mr. Collins!" 
"My dear madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point. Far be it from me," he presently continued, in a voice that marked his displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to inevitable evils is the evil duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair. My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my MANNER has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise." 
Chapter 21
The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her mother. As for the gentleman himself, HIS feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend. 
The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill-humour or ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay. 
After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball. He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their aunt's where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence HAD been self-imposed. 
"I found," said he, "as the time drew near that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself." 
She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother. 
Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and he companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs. When they had gained their own room, Jane, taking out the letter, said: 
"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to townï¿½and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear what she says." 
She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was in these words: "I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that." To these highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his. 
"It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them." 
"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you: 
"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowdï¿½but of that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you." 
"It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this winter." 
"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he SHOULD." 
"Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own master. But you do not know ALL. I WILL read you the passage which particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from YOU." 
"Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth, WE are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?" 
"What do you think of THIS sentence, my dear Lizzy?" said Jane as she finished it. "Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?" 
"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?" 
"Most willingly." 
"You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you." 
Jane shook her head. 
"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been ONE intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of YOUR merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend." 
"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself." 
"That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means. You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer." 
"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?" 
"You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth; "and if, upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him." 
"How can you talk so?" said Jane, faintly smiling. "You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate." 
"I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion." 
"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required. A thousand things may arise in six months!" 
The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone. 
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect. Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart. 
They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses. 
Chapter 22
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. "It keeps him in good humour," said she, "and I am more obliged to you than I can express." Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there. 
In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow, everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained. 
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of COMING OUT a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love. 
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his engagements might allow him to visit them. 
"My dear madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible." 
They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said: 
"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness." 
"My dear sir," replied Mr. Collins," I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence." 
"You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that WE shall take no offence." 
"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth." 
With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him. She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before. 
The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying herself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out: 
"Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotteï¿½impossible!" 
The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied: 
"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?" 
But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness. 
"I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte. "You must be surprised, very much surprisedï¿½so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state." 
Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;" and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen. 
Chapter 23
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matterï¿½to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed: 
"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?" 
Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy. 
Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London. 
Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter. 
Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter! 
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton. 
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away. 
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his return. 
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men. 
Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued absence. 
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood. 
Even Elizabeth began to fearï¿½not that Bingley was indifferentï¿½but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment. 
As for Jane, HER anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth's, but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity. 
Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed. 
Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She complained bitterly of all this to her husband. 
"Indeed, Mr. Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for HER, and live to see her take her place in it!" 
"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor." 
This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before. 
"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was not for the entail, I should not mind it." 
"What should not you mind?" 
"I should not mind anything at all." 
"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility." 
"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too! Why should HE have it more than anybody else?" 
"I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr. Bennet. 
Chapter 24
Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country. 
Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture. 
Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best, but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded. 
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying: 
"Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before." 
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing. 
"You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed, you have no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not THAT pain. A little time, thereforeï¿½I shall certainly try to get the better." 
With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself." 
"My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good. Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve." 
Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection. 
"Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair. YOU wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want to think YOU perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte's marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is unaccountable!" 
"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, and Charlotte's steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin." 
"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger security for happiness." 
"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied Jane; "and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You mentioned TWO instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking THAT PERSON to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than it does." 
"And men take care that they should." 
"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine. 
"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design," said Elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business." 
"And do you impute it to either of those?" 
"Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can." 
"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?" 
Yes, in conjunction with his friend." 
"I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it." 
"Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride." 
"Beyond a doubt, they DO wish him to choose Miss Darcy," replied Jane; "but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's. What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been mistakenï¿½or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood." 
Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them. 
Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet's best comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer. 
Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. "So, Lizzy," said he one day, "your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then. It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham be YOUR man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably." 
"Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not all expect Jane's good fortune." 
"True," said Mr. Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make the most of it." 
Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known anything of the matter. 
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakesï¿½but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men. 
Chapter 25
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks. 
On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard. They had frequently been staying with her in town. 
The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it. 
"I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had it not been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves." 
Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the conversation. 
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. "It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane," said she. "I am sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent." 
"An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it will not do for US. We do not suffer by ACCIDENT. It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before." 
"But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how VIOLENT WAS Mr. Bingley's love?" 
"I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?" 
"Oh, yes!ï¿½of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to YOU, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be of serviceï¿½and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything." 
Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence. 
"I hope," added Mrs. Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her." 
"And THAT is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have HEARD of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him." 
"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane correspond with his sister? SHE will not be able to help calling." 
"She will drop the acquaintance entirely." 
But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions. 
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she hoped by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him. 
The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of itï¿½of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasion, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment. 
To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring. 
Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberly, and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberly with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy. 
Chapter 26
Mrs. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on: 
"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against HIM; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect you to use it. Your father would depend on YOUR resolution and good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father." 
"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed." 
"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise." 
"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it." 
"Elizabeth, you are not serious now." 
"I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever sawï¿½and if he becomes really attached to meï¿½I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh! THAT abominable Mr. Darcy! My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best." 
"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often. At least, you should not REMIND you mother of inviting him." 
"As I did the other day," said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: "very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from THAT. But do not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week. You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied." 
Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented. 
Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she "WISHED they might be happy." Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said: 
"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza." 
"THAT you certainly shall." 
"And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?" 
"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire." 
"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford." 
Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit. 
"My father and Maria are coming to me in March," added Charlotte, "and I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them." 
The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest. 
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys. 
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lost. 
"My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street." 
She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley. "I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall see them soon here." 
Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town. 
Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt. 
"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though WE know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happyï¿½your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.ï¿½Yours, etc." 
This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least. All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy's sister, as by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away. 
Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that SHE would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggle to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy. 
All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on: "I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial towards HIM; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain." 
Chapter 27
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be. 
The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter. 
The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of herï¿½their opinion of everybodyï¿½would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing. 
Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William's too long. He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out, like his information. 
It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres. 
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance. 
Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well. 
"But my dear Elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is Miss King? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary." 
"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary." 
"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think." 
"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her." 
"But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune." 
"Noï¿½what should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain MY affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?" 
"But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event." 
"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe. If SHE does not object to it, why should WE?" 
"HER not objecting does not justify HIM. It only shows her being deficient in something herselfï¿½sense or feeling." 
"Well," cried Elizabeth, "have it as you choose. HE shall be mercenary, and SHE shall be foolish." 
"No, Lizzy, that is what I do NOT choose. I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire." 
"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all." 
"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment." 
Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer. 
"We have not determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs. Gardiner, "but, perhaps, to the Lakes." 
No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. "Oh, my dear, dear aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when we DO return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We WILL know where we have goneï¿½we WILL recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let OUR first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers." 
Chapter 28
Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight. 
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view. The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants. 
At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment. 
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many tress there were in the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground. 
From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband's help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten. 
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed: 
"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I SHOULD say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several." 
"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed, added Charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour." 
"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference." 
The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all. 
About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried outï¿½ 
"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make haste, and come down this moment." 
Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate. 
"And is this all?" cried Elizabeth. "I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter." 
"La! my dear," said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?" 
"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind. Why does she not come in?" 
"Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in." 
"I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. "She looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will make him a very proper wife." 
Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way. 
At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day. 
Chapter 29
Mr. Collins's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough. 
"I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!" 
"I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir William, "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon." 
Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them. 
When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabethï¿½ 
"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the restï¿½there is no occasion for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved." 
While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at St. James's. 
As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh. 
When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm. Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation. 
From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary. 
In spite of having been at St. James's Sir William was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented. 
When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment at her being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes. 
After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer. 
The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourghï¿½the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire. 
When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to have her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then observed, 
"Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your sake," turning to Charlotte, "I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family. Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?" 
"A little." 
"Oh! thenï¿½some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior toï¿½ï¿½You shall try it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?" 
"One of them does." 
"Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do you draw?" 
"No, not at all." 
"What, none of you?" 
"Not one." 
"That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters." 
"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London." 
"Has your governess left you?" 
"We never had any governess." 
"No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education." 
Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case. 
"Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must have been neglected." 
"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be idle, certainly might." 
"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf's calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. 'Lady Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?" 
"Yes, ma'am, all." 
"All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters must be very young?" 
"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps SHE is full young to be much in company. But really, ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth at the first. And to be kept back on SUCH a motive! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind." 
"Upon my word," said her ladyship, "you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?" 
"With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth, smiling, "your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it." 
Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence. 
"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not conceal your age." 
"I am not one-and-twenty." 
When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the other table. Lady Catherine was generally speakingï¿½stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many. Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names. 
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins's side and as many bows on Sir William's they departed. As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise into his own hands. 
Chapter 30
Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room, which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement. 
From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out. 
Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family. 
Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty. 
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach. This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity. 
In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away. Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself. 
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle Lord ï¿½ï¿½, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentleman accompanied him. Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding: 
"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me." 
Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshireï¿½paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word. 
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody. At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment's pause, added: 
"My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never happened to see her there?" 
She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away. 
Chapter 31
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thitherï¿½for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen only at church. 
The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room. 
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy. HIS eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out: 
"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is." 
"We are speaking of music, madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply. 
"Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music. There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?" 
Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency. 
"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady Catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practice a good deal." 
"I assure you, madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice. She practises very constantly." 
"So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson's room. She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part of the house." 
Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill-breeding, and made no answer. 
When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said: 
"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me? I will not be alarmed though your sister DOES play so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me." 
"I shall not say you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own." 
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshireï¿½and, give me leave to say, very impolitic tooï¿½for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear." 
"I am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly. 
"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried Colonel Fitzwilliam. "I should like to know how he behaves among strangers." 
"You shall hear thenï¿½but prepare yourself for something very dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ballï¿½and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact." 
"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party." 
"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders." 
"Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers." 
Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. "Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?" 
"I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "without applying to him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble." 
"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy, "of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done." 
"My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own faultï¿½because I will not take the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe MY fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution." 
Darcy smiled and said, "You are perfectly right. You have employed your time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers." 
Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy: 
"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's. Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn." 
Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry HER, had she been his relation. 
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home. 
Chapter 32
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room. 
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were to be within. 
They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting WHEN she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed: 
"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?" 
"Perfectly so, I thank you." 
She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short pause added: 
"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?" 
"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing." 
"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle." 
"I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers." 
Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him. 
He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford." 
"I believe she didï¿½and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object." 
"Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife." 
"Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understandingï¿½though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her." 
"It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends." 
"An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles." 
"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's journey. Yes, I call it a VERY easy distance." 
I should never have considered the distance as one of the ADVANTAGES of the match," cried Elizabeth. "I should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled NEAR her family." 
"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far." 
As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered: 
"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the case HERE. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeysï¿½and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself NEAR her family under less than HALF the present distance." 
Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "YOU cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. YOU cannot have been always at Longbourn." 
Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice: 
"Are you pleased with Kent?" 
A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and conciseï¿½and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away. 
"What can be the meaning of this?" said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone. "My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never have called us in this familiar way." 
But when Elizabeth told of his silence; it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind. 
But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choiceï¿½a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind. 
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power. 
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all. 
Chapter 33
More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questionsï¿½about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying THERE too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean and allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage. 
She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane's last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said: 
"I did not know before that you ever walked this way." 
"I have been making the tour of the park," he replied, "as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?" 
"No, I should have turned in a moment." 
And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together. 
"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she. 
"Yesï¿½if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He arranges the business just as he pleases." 
"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy." 
"He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam. "But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence." 
"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?" 
"These are home questionsï¿½and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where they like." 
"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do." 
Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are too many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money." 
"Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "And pray, what is the usual price of an earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds." 
He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said: 
"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her." 
"No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy." 
"Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way." 
As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth. She directly replied: 
"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them." 
"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike manï¿½he is a great friend of Darcy's." 
"Oh! yes," said Elizabeth drily; "Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him." 
"Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy DOES take care of him in those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture." 
"What is it you mean?" 
"It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing." 
"You may depend upon my not mentioning it." 
"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer." 
"Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?" 
"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady." 
"And what arts did he use to separate them?" 
"He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam, smiling. "He only told me what I have now told you." 
Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful. 
"I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she. "Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?" 
"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?" 
"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy. But," she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case." 
"That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it is a lessening of the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly." 
This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There could not exist in the world TWO men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, HE was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted. 
"There were some very strong objections against the lady," were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words; and those strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London. 
"To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!ï¿½her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never each." When she thought of her mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any objections THERE had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister. 
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home. 
Chapter 34
When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering. But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the nextï¿½and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do. 
She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him. 
While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began: 
"In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you." 
Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her, immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiorityï¿½of its being a degradationï¿½of the family obstacles which had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit. 
In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer. He SPOKE of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said: 
"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could FEEL gratitude, I would now thank you. But I cannotï¿½I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation." 
Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said: 
"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little ENDEAVOUR at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance." 
"I might as well inquire," replied she, "why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I WAS uncivil? But I have other provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against youï¿½had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?" 
As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued: 
"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted THERE. You dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each otherï¿½of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind." 
She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse. He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity. 
"Can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated. 
With assumed tranquillity he then replied: "I have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards HIM I have been kinder than towards myself." 
Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her. 
"But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?" 
"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour. 
"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?" 
"His misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed." 
"And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy. "You have reduced him to his present state of povertyï¿½comparative poverty. You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule." 
"And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, "is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps," added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, "these offenses might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?ï¿½to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?" 
Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said: 
"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner." 
She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued: 
"You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it." 
Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on: 
"From the very beginningï¿½from the first moment, I may almost sayï¿½of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry." 
"You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness." 
And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house. 
The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own caseï¿½was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable prideï¿½his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Janeï¿½his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room. 
Chapter 35
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground. 
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure, "I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?" And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight. 
With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:ï¿½ 
"Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice. 
"Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. 
"I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment. If YOU have not been mistaken here, I must have been in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certainï¿½but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning. 
"The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We accordingly wentï¿½and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them. 
"With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he has PARTICULARLY accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity. 
"Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridgeï¿½most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not only fond of this young man's society, whose manner were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensitiesï¿½the want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have. Here again shall give you painï¿½to what degree you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real characterï¿½it adds even another motive. 
"My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allowï¿½and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the business was therefore soon settledï¿½he resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in questionï¿½of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstancesï¿½and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice. 
"I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed. 
"This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination. 
"You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of ME should make MY assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning. I will only add, God bless you, 
"FITZWILLIAM DARCY" 
Chapter 36
If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited. Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and insolence. 
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickhamï¿½when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himselfï¿½her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition. Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!"ï¿½and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again. 
In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence. The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartialityï¿½deliberated on the probability of each statementï¿½but with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole. 
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his entrance into the ï¿½ï¿½shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years' continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himselfï¿½from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration. 
She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips's. Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was NOW struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcyï¿½that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that HE should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son. 
How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything. His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintanceï¿½an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his waysï¿½seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjustï¿½anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was esteemed and valuedï¿½that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of SOME amiable feeling; that had his actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible. 
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd. 
"How despicably I have acted!" she cried; "I, who have prided myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself." 
From herself to Janeï¿½from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation THERE had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane. She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility. 
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers. 
The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before. 
After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thoughtï¿½re-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation. 
She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take leaveï¿½but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just AFFECT concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object; she could think only of her letter. 
Chapter 37
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her. 
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have been. "What would she have said? how would she have behaved?" were questions with which she amused herself. 
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. "I assure you, I feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; "I believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His attachment to Rosings certainly increases." 
Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter. 
Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added: 
"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company, I am sure." 
"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied Elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town next Saturday." 
"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight." 
"But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return." 
"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay another MONTH complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of youï¿½and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large." 
"You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan." 
Lady Catherine seemed resigned. "Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to YOU to let them go alone." 
"My uncle is to send a servant for us." 
"Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses? Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to." 
Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections. 
Mr. Darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion. His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there forever. 
Anxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family! 
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful. 
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh. 
When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both. 
Chapter 38
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary. 
"I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs. Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it. The favor of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly." 
Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make HER feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling solemnity replied: 
"It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings." 
Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences. 
"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so. Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs. Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunateï¿½but on this point it will be as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each other." 
Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms. 
At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings. 
"But," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here." 
Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off. 
"Good gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes' silence, "it seems but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have happened!" 
"A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh. 
"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice! How much I shall have to tell!" 
Elizabeth added privately, "And how much I shall have to conceal!" 
Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few days. 
Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation. 
It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals. To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister further. 
Chapter 39
It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ï¿½ï¿½, in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room upstairs. These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad and cucumber. 
After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, "Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?" 
"And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia, "but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there." Then, showing her purchasesï¿½"Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better." 
And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, "Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ï¿½ï¿½shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight." 
"Are they indeed!" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction. 
"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!" 
"Yes," thought Elizabeth, "THAT would be a delightful scheme indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!" 
"Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down at table. "What do you think? It is excellent newsï¿½capital newsï¿½and about a certain person we all like!" 
Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said: 
"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King. There's for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe." 
"And Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth; "safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune." 
"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him." 
"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said Jane. 
"I am sure there is not on HIS. I will answer for it, he never cared three straws about herï¿½who could about such a nasty little freckled thing?" 
Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of EXPRESSION herself, the coarseness of the SENTIMENT was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal! 
As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases, were seated in it. 
"How nicely we are all crammed in," cried Lydia. "I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are SUCH friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes on purpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I should have died. And THAT made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter." 
With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name. 
Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth: 
"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy." 
Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her. 
"Oh! Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun! As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!" 
To this Mary very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for MEï¿½I should infinitely prefer a book." 
But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all. 
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to HER of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond expression. In a fortnight they were to goï¿½and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account. 
She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last. 
Chapter 40
Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself. 
Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him. 
"His being so sure of succeeding was wrong," said she, "and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment!" 
"Indeed," replied Elizabeth, "I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?" 
"Blame you! Oh, no." 
"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?" 
"Noï¿½I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did." 
"But you WILL know it, when I tell you what happened the very next day." 
She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy's vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the one without involving the other. 
"This will not do," said Elizabeth; "you never will be able to make both of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's; but you shall do as you choose." 
It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane. 
"I do not know when I have been more shocked," said she. "Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it so." 
"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather." 
"Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!" 
"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it." 
"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the APPEARANCE of it as you used to do." 
"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty." 
"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now." 
"Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!" 
"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they DO appear wholly undeserved." 
"Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand Wickham's character." 
Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, "Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?" 
"That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present I will say nothing about it." 
"You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate." 
The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation. She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery. "And then," said she, "if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!" 
She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity. 
"Well, Lizzy," said Mrs. Bennet one day, "what is your opinion NOW of this sad business of Jane's? For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a very undeserving young manï¿½and I do not suppose there's the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of everybody, too, who is likely to know." 
"I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more." 
"Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done." 
But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer. 
"Well, Lizzy," continued her mother, soon afterwards, "and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in THEIR housekeeping, I dare say." 
"No, nothing at all." 
"A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. THEY will take care not to outrun their income. THEY will never be distressed for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens." 
"It was a subject which they could not mention before me." 
"No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me." 
Chapter 41
The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family. 
"Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?" would they often exclaiming the bitterness of woe. "How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?" 
Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years ago. 
"I am sure," said she, "I cried for two days together when Colonel Miller's regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart." 
"I am sure I shall break MINE," said Lydia. 
"If one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs. Bennet. 
"Oh, yes!ï¿½if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable." 
"A little sea-bathing would set me up forever." 
"And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do ME a great deal of good," added Kitty. 
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend. 
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their THREE months' acquaintance they had been intimate TWO. 
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish. 
"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask ME as well as Lydia," said she, "Though I am NOT her particular friend. I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older." 
In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said: 
"Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances." 
"If you were aware," said Elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent mannerï¿½nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair." 
"Already arisen?" repeated Mr. Bennet. "What, has she frightened away some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly." 
"Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?" 
Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and affectionately taking her hand said in reply: 
"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple ofï¿½or I may say, threeï¿½very silly sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life." 
With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition. 
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility. In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers. She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the campï¿½its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once. 
Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same. Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself. 
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia's leaving home. 
Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of formal partiality entirely so. She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified, and her preference secured at any time by their renewal. 
On the very last day of the regiment's remaining at Meryton, he dined, with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former. 
He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour. With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added: 
"How long did you say he was at Rosings?" 
"Nearly three weeks." 
"And you saw him frequently?" 
"Yes, almost every day." 
"His manners are very different from his cousin's." 
"Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance." 
"Indeed!" cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. "And pray, may I ask?ï¿½" But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, "Is it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style?ï¿½for I dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials." 
"Oh, no!" said Elizabeth. "In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was." 
While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added: 
"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood." 
Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minuted he was silent, till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents: 
"You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the APPEARANCE of what is right. His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart." 
Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him. The rest of the evening passed with the APPEARANCE, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again. 
When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possibleï¿½advice which there was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard. 
Chapter 42
Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put and end to all real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly of their vice. He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given. 
Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife. 
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes been found before, that an event to which she had been looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicityï¿½to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect. 
"But it is fortunate," thought she, "that I have something to wish for. Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain. But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation." 
When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learntï¿½for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public. 
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton. 
The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak. 
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it was her business to be satisfiedï¿½and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again. 
With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner. "But surely," said she, "I may enter his county without impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me." 
The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every wayï¿½teaching them, playing with them, and loving them. 
The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One enjoyment was certainï¿½that of suitableness of companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniencesï¿½cheerfulness to enhance every pleasureï¿½and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad. 
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation. 
"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?" said her aunt; "a place, too, with which so many of your acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you know." 
Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains. 
Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. "If it were merely a fine house richly furnished," said she, "I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the country." 
Elizabeth said no moreï¿½but her mind could not acquiesce. The possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered. 
Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last questionï¿½and her alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go. 
Chapter 43
Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter. 
The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent. 
Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something! 
They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was. 
The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings. 
"And of this place," thought she, "I might have been mistress! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,"ï¿½recollecting herselfï¿½"that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have been allowed to invite them." 
This was a lucky recollectionï¿½it saved her from something very like regret. 
She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was, adding, "But we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends." How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day! 
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expense. "He is now gone into the army," she added; "but I am afraid he has turned out very wild." 
Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it. 
"And that," said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, "is my masterï¿½and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the otherï¿½about eight years ago." 
"I have heard much of your master's fine person," said Mrs. Gardiner, looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not." 
Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master. 
"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?" 
Elizabeth coloured, and said: "A little." 
"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?" 
"Yes, very handsome." 
"I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then. He was very fond of them." 
This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them. 
Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old. 
"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mrs. Gardiner. 
"Oh! yesï¿½the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!ï¿½She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a new instrument just come down for herï¿½a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him." 
Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister. 
"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?" 
"Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months." 
"Except," thought Elizabeth, "when she goes to Ramsgate." 
"If your master would marry, you might see more of him." 
"Yes, sir; but I do not know when THAT will be. I do not know who is good enough for him." 
Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, "It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so." 
"I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him," replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, "I have never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old." 
This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion. Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying: 
"There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in having such a master." 
"Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the world." 
Elizabeth almost stared at her. "Can this be Mr. Darcy?" thought she. 
"His father was an excellent man," said Mrs. Gardiner. 
"Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like himï¿½just as affable to the poor." 
Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain, Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase. 
"He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men." 
"In what an amiable light does this place him!" thought Elizabeth. 
"This fine account of him," whispered her aunt as they walked, "is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend." 
"Perhaps we might be deceived." 
"That is not very likely; our authority was too good." 
On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when last at Pemberley. 
"He is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows. 
Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter the room. "And this is always the way with him," she added. "Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There is nothing he would not do for her." 
The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible. 
In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested herï¿½and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father's lifetime. 
There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!ï¿½how much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!ï¿½how much of good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression. 
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door. 
As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables. 
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility. 
She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts. 
At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave. 
The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrivedï¿½that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly alteredï¿½what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was amazing!ï¿½but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account for it. 
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mindï¿½in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been THAT in his voice which was not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure. 
At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself. 
They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk here being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said no more. 
Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself. "What will be his surprise," thought she, "when he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of fashion." 
The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions. That he was SURPRISED by the connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned his back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners. 
The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and continually was she repeating, "Why is he so altered? From what can it proceed? It cannot be for MEï¿½it cannot be for MY sake that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me." 
After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpectedï¿½"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country." He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. "They will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with youï¿½Mr. Bingley and his sisters." 
Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, HIS mind was not very differently engaged. 
"There is also one other person in the party," he continued after a pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?" 
The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her. 
They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind. 
He then asked her to walk into the houseï¿½but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowlyï¿½and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn our before the tete-a-tete was over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house. 
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected. "He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle. 
"There IS something a little stately in him, to be sure," replied her aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I have seen nothing of it." 
"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling." 
"To be sure, Lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as Wickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable?" 
Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning. 
"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied her uncle. "Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds." 
Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but said nothing. 
"From what we have seen of him," continued Mrs. Gardiner, "I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and THAT in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue." 
Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as such as might be relied on. 
Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a intercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance. 
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister. 
Chapter 44
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning. But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her. 
She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse. 
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable. 
Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings. 
They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done. 
To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough. 
Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased. 
In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield." 
Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether ALL her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning. 
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgraceï¿½when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonageï¿½the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield as Rosings. 
Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how SHE, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on. 
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress. 
But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify inquiry. 
Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor. 
With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged. 
As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards ONE in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitudeï¿½for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses. 
It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply. 
Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon. 
Chapter 45
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed. 
On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn. 
In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her. 
By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard. 
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the others said no more. 
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole partyï¿½for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the table. 
While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came. 
He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility: 
"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ï¿½ï¿½shire Militia removed from Meryton? They must be a great loss to YOUR family." 
In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should effect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend. 
Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully. 
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister. 
"How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy," she cried; "I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again." 
However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer. 
"For my own part," she rejoined, "I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants characterï¿½there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable." 
Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued: 
"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, 'SHE a beauty!ï¿½I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time." 
"Yes," replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but THAT was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintances." 
He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself. 
Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruitï¿½of everything but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject. 
Chapter 46
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill. 
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had been written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect: 
"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming youï¿½be assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia. An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing. Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written." 
Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first. 
"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any successï¿½no such people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if HE could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he fear W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such and exigence, my uncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness." 
"Oh! where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation, hastily exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to loose." 
"Good God! what is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, "I will not detain you a minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself." 
Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home instantly. 
On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, "Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill." 
"No, I thank you," she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. "There is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn." 
She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At length she spoke again. "I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger sister has left all her friendsï¿½has eloped; has thrown herself into the power ofï¿½of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. YOU know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him toï¿½she is lost for ever." 
Darcy was fixed in astonishment. "When I consider," she added in a yet more agitated voice, "that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what he was. Had I but explained some part of it onlyï¿½some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not have happened. But it is allï¿½all too late now." 
"I am grieved indeed," cried Darcy; "grievedï¿½shocked. But is it certainï¿½absolutely certain?" 
"Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland." 
"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?" 
"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But nothing can be doneï¿½I know very well that nothing can be done. How is such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!" 
Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence. 
"When MY eyes were opened to his real characterï¿½Oh! had I known what I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew notï¿½I was afraid of doing too much. Wretched, wretched mistake!" 
Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power was sinking; everything MUST sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing to her consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain. 
But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydiaï¿½the humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day." 
"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long." 
He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting look, went away. 
As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination. 
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if otherwiseï¿½if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first letter remained in her mind, she was all surpriseï¿½all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey. 
She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girlï¿½oh! how acutely did she now feel it! 
She was wild to be at homeï¿½to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant's account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy, though Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. "But what is to be done about Pemberley?" cried Mrs. Gardiner. "John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us; was it so?" 
"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement. THAT is all settled." 
"What is all settled?" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare. "And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!" 
But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn. 
Chapter 47
"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is not adequate to the risk!" 
"Do you really think so?" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment. 
"Upon my word," said Mrs. Gardiner, "I begin to be of your uncle's opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?" 
"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the case?" 
"In the first place," replied Mr. Gardiner, "there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland." 
"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road." 
"Well, thenï¿½supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland." 
But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their marriage be private? Oh, no, noï¿½this is not likely. His most particular friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydiaï¿½what attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that HE would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter." 
"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?" 
"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a twelvemonthï¿½she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way. Since the ï¿½ï¿½shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greaterï¿½what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman." 
"But you see that Jane," said her aunt, "does not think so very ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt." 
"Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating." 
"And do you really know all this?" cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive. 
"I do indeed," replied Elizabeth, colouring. "I told you, the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other circumstances which I am not at libertyï¿½which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her." 
"But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?" 
"Oh, yes!ï¿½that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ï¿½ï¿½shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That SHE could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a consequence as THIS could ensue, you may easily believe, was far enough from my thoughts." 
"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?" 
"Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished HER by any particular attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites." 
* * * * * 
It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent. Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness. 
They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations. 
The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome. 
Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her mother's apartment, immediately met her. 
Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives. 
"Not yet," replied Jane. "But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope everything will be well." 
"Is my father in town?" 
"Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word." 
"And have you heard from him often?" 
"We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention." 
"And my motherï¿½how is she? How are you all?" 
"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken. She is upstairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty are, thank Heaven, are quite well." 
"But youï¿½how are you?" cried Elizabeth. "You look pale. How much you must have gone through!" 
Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears. 
When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage. 
Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes' conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owing. 
"If I had been able," said she, "to carry my point in going to Brighton, with all my family, THIS would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child! And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do." 
They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia. 
"Do not give way to useless alarm," added he; "though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain. It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as to what is to be done." 
"Oh! my dear brother," replied Mrs. Bennet, "that is exactly what I could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, MAKE them marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them, after they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my witsï¿½and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over meï¿½such spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all." 
But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters. 
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that ONE only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject. 
In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table: 
"This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation." 
Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, "Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex." 
Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them. 
In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the subject, by saying, "But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. hat did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place? They must have seen them together for ever." 
"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He WAS coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey." 
"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?" 
"Yes; but, when questioned by HIM, Denny denied knowing anything of their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marryingï¿½and from THAT, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before." 
"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?" 
"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt a little uneasyï¿½a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks." 
"But not before they went to Brighton?" 
"No, I believe not." 
"And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does he know his real character?" 
"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false." 
"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!" 
"Perhaps it would have been better," replied her sister. "But to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions." 
"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife?" 
"He brought it with him for us to see." 
Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These were the contents: 
"MY DEAR HARRIET, 
"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them and sign my name 'Lydia Wickham.' What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will drink to our good journey. 
"Your affectionate friend, 
"LYDIA BENNET." 
"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!" cried Elizabeth when she had finished it. What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! But at least it shows that SHE was serious on the subject of their journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a SCHEME of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!" 
"I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!" 
"Oh! Jane," cried Elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?" 
"I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties." 
"Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone." 
"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them. Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters', if they should be of use to us." 
"She had better have stayed at home," cried Elizabeth; "perhaps she MEANT well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied." 
She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter. 
"He meant I believe," replied Jane, "to go to Epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this." 
Chapter 48
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him. His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion. They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of THAT they would have been glad to be certain. Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off. 
When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel. 
Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them upï¿½though, as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them. 
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family. Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them. 
Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect: 
"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself. If there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps, Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any other person." 
Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of his companions in the ï¿½ï¿½shire might be able to give more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to. 
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was the grand object of every morning's impatience. Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance. 
But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as follows: 
"MY DEAR SIR, 
"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortuneï¿½or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parent's mind. The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense. 
"I am, dear sir, etc., etc." 
Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send. It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. "A gamester!" she cried. "This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it." 
Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law's entreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before. 
"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?" she cried. "Sure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?" 
As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn. 
Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from Pemberley. 
The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from THAT, though Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two. 
When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it. 
It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "Say nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it." 
"You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth. 
"You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression. It will pass away soon enough." 
"Do you suppose them to be in London?" 
"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?" 
"And Lydia used to want to go to London," added Kitty. 
"She is happy then," said her father drily; "and her residence there will probably be of some duration." 
Then after a short silence he continued: 
"Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind." 
They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's tea. 
"This is a parade," he cried, "which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away." 
"I am not going to run away, papa," said Kitty fretfully. "If I should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia." 
"YOU go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner." 
Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry. 
"Well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them." 
Chapter 49
Two days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, "I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask." 
"What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town." 
"Dear madam," cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here this half-hour, and master has had a letter." 
Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the library; their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him upstairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said: 
"If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the little copse." 
Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock. 
Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out: 
"Oh, papa, what newsï¿½what news? Have you heard from my uncle?" 
"Yes I have had a letter from him by express." 
"Well, and what news does it bringï¿½good or bad?" 
"What is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from his pocket. "But perhaps you would like to read it." 
Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up. 
"Read it aloud," said their father, "for I hardly know myself what it is about." 
"Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2. 
"MY DEAR BROTHER, 
"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered. I have seen them bothï¿½" 
"Then it is as I always hoped," cried Jane; "they are married!" 
Elizabeth read on: 
"I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be. The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on. Yours, etc., 
"EDW. GARDINER." 
"Is it possible?" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. "Can it be possible that he will marry her?" 
"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him," said her sister. "My dear father, I congratulate you." 
"And have you answered the letter?" cried Elizabeth. 
"No; but it must be done soon." 
Most earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more time before he wrote. 
"Oh! my dear father," she cried, "come back and write immediately. Consider how important every moment is in such a case." 
"Let me write for you," said Jane, "if you dislike the trouble yourself." 
"I dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done." 
And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house. 
"And may I askï¿½" said Elizabeth; "but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with." 
"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little." 
"And they MUST marry! Yet he is SUCH a man!" 
"Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay him." 
"Money! My uncle!" cried Jane, "what do you mean, sir?" 
"I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am gone." 
"That is very true," said Elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this." 
"No," said her father; "Wickham's a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship." 
"Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?" 
Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room. 
"And they are really to be married!" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves. "How strange this is! And for THIS we are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!" 
"I comfort myself with thinking," replied Jane, "that he certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?" 
"If he were ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been," said Elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!" 
"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said Jane: "I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten." 
"Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it." 
It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly replied: 
"Just as you please." 
"May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?" 
"Take whatever you like, and get away." 
Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went upstairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct. 
"My dear, dear Lydia!" she cried. "This is delightful indeed! She will be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen! My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!" 
Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under. 
"For we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money." 
"Well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy! In a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately." 
She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted. One day's delay, she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head. 
"I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding." 
Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom. 
Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained. 
Chapter 50
Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place. 
He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could. 
When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income. 
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother's hands, Lydia's expenses had been very little within that sum. 
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her. 
The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery was considered certain. 
It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance. 
"Haye Park might do," said she, "if the Gouldings could quit itï¿½or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful." 
Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: "Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into ONE house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn." 
A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took place. 
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot. 
She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so muchï¿½not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned. 
From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they should meet. 
What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal, there must be a triumph. 
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved; and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance. 
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family. 
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture. 
* * * * * 
Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the militia. 
"It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon as his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my niece's. It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into the regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an ensigncy in General ï¿½ï¿½'s regiment, now quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and your mother.ï¿½Yours, etc., 
"E. GARDINER." 
Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the ï¿½ï¿½shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia's being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody, and had so many favourites. 
"She is so fond of Mrs. Forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in Generalï¿½ï¿½'s regiment." 
His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the North, received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes. 
Chapter 51
Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet them at ï¿½ï¿½, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure. 
They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy. 
Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness. 
Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there. 
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour. 
There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world. 
"Only think of its being three months," she cried, "since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was." 
Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "Oh! mamma, do the people here abouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like any thing." 
Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, "Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman." 
It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "Mrs. Wickham" by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids. 
"Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, "and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go." 
"Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don't at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?" 
"Oh, lord! yes;ï¿½there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all." 
"I should like it beyond any thing!" said her mother. 
"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over." 
"I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth; "but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands." 
Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight. 
No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not. 
Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion. 
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country. 
One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth: 
"Lizzy, I never gave YOU an account of my wedding, I believe. You were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?" 
"No really," replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too little said on the subject." 
"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat." 
"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or any thing. To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well." 
"Mr. Darcy!" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement. 
"Oh, yes!ï¿½he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!" 
"If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on the subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further." 
"Oh! certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will ask you no questions." 
"Thank you," said Lydia, "for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry." 
On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away. 
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go. Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended. 
"You may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand itï¿½unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance." 
"Not that I SHALL, though," she added to herself, as she finished the letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out." 
Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;ï¿½till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante. 
Chapter 52
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial. 
"Gracechurch street, Sept. 6. 
"MY DEAR NIECE, 
"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a LITTLE writing will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from YOU. Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on YOUR side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I amï¿½and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as YOUR'S seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he HAD ANOTHER motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than WE had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found. Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ï¿½ï¿½ street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never been HIS design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight on her own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on. Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. Every thing being settled between THEM, Mr. Darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business. On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together. They met again on Sunday, and then I saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times, but THIS is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle would most readily have settled the whole. They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon HER, and his commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in THIS; though I doubt whether HIS reserve, or ANYBODY'S reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for ANOTHER INTEREST in the affair. When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house. HE was exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and THAT, if he marry PRUDENTLY, his wife may teach him. I thought him very sly;ï¿½he hardly ever mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing. But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half hour. Yours, very sincerely, 
"M. GARDINER." 
The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her ï¿½for a woman who had already refused himï¿½as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself. She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself. 
She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by Wickham. 
"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?" said he, as he joined her. 
"You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome." 
"I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and now we are better." 
"True. Are the others coming out?" 
"I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley." 
She replied in the affirmative. 
"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me. But of course she did not mention my name to you." 
"Yes, she did." 
"And what did she say?" 
"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had ï¿½not turned out well. At such a distance as THAT, you know, things are strangely misrepresented." 
"Certainly," he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said: 
"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other several times. I wonder what he can be doing there." 
"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh," said Elizabeth. "It must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year." 
"Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had." 
"Yes; he introduced us to his sister." 
"And do you like her?" 
"Very much." 
"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn out well." 
"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age." 
"Did you go by the village of Kympton?" 
"I do not recollect that we did." 
"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most delightful place!ï¿½Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited me in every respect." 
"How should you have liked making sermons?" 
"Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine;ï¿½but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?" 
"I have heard from authority, which I thought AS GOOD, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron." 
"You have. Yes, there was something in THAT; I told you so from the first, you may remember." 
"I DID hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly." 
"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it." 
They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister's sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile: 
"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind." 
She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house. 
Chapter 53
Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet. 
The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth. 
"Oh! my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?" 
"Oh, lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years, perhaps." 
"Write to me very often, my dear." 
"As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for writing. My sisters may write to ME. They will have nothing else to do." 
Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's. He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things. 
"He is as fine a fellow," said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, "as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law." 
The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days. 
"I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends. One seems so forlorn without them." 
"This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said Elizabeth. "It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single." 
"It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married, but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off. If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon." 
But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and smiled and shook her head by turns. 
"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister," (for Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news). "Well, so much the better. Not that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what MAY happen? But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?" 
"You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed." 
Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said: 
"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don't imagine it was from any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I SHOULD be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of MYSELF, but I dread other people's remarks." 
Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there WITH his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it. 
"Yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation! I WILL leave him to himself." 
In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them. 
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again. 
"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "you will wait on him of course." 
"No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again." 
His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield. 
"'Tis an etiquette I despise," said he. "If he wants our society, let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again." 
"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him." 
Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before THEY did. As the day of his arrival drew near: 
"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said Jane to her sister. "It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!" 
"I wish I could say any thing to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much." 
Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock and ride towards the house. 
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the windowï¿½she looked,ï¿½she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister. 
"There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty; "who can it be?" 
"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know." 
"La!" replied Kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with him before. Mr. what's-his-name. That tall, proud man." 
"Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!ï¿½and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him." 
Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his comingï¿½at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire. 
The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure. 
"Let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early enough for expectation." 
She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance. 
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture. 
Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend. 
Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied. 
Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing. He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised he eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so. 
"Could I expect it to be otherwise!" said she. "Yet why did he come?" 
She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak. 
She inquired after his sister, but could do no more. 
"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away," said Mrs. Bennet. 
He readily agreed to it. 
"I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People DID say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, 'Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing. It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?" 
Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell. 
"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married," continued her mother, "but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ï¿½ï¿½shire, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank Heaven! he has SOME friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves." 
Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present. A few weeks, he believed. 
"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley," said her mother, "I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr. Bennet's manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you." 
Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion. 
"The first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either one or the other again!" 
Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent. 
When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time. 
"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley," she added, "for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement." 
Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away. 
Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think any thing less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year. 
Chapter 54
As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her. 
"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she, "did he come at all?" 
She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure. 
"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will think no more about him." 
Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth. 
"Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance." 
"Yes, very indifferent indeed," said Elizabeth, laughingly. "Oh, Jane, take care." 
"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?" 
"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever." 
* * * * * 
They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived. 
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided. He placed himself by her. 
Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm. 
His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family. 
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend. 
"If he does not come to me, THEN," said she, "I shall give him up for ever." 
The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper: 
"The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them; do we?" 
Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly! 
"A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman? There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!" 
She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying: 
"Is your sister at Pemberley still?" 
"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas." 
"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?" 
"Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks." 
She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away. 
When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure. They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself. 
Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them. 
"Well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "What say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The venison was roasted to a turnï¿½and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases' last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what do you think she said besides? 'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever livedï¿½and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously." 
Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals. 
"It has been a very agreeable day," said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. "The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we may often meet again." 
Elizabeth smiled. 
"Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man." 
"You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment." 
"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!" 
"And how impossible in others!" 
"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?" 
"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante." 
Chapter 55
A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere. 
"Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more lucky." 
He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them. 
"Can you come to-morrow?" 
Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity. 
He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out: 
"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is comeï¿½Mr. Bingley is come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair." 
"We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago." 
"Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick! Where is your sash, my dear?" 
But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters. 
The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, "What is the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?" 
"Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you." She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, "Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her entreaty that SHE would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half-opened the door and called out: 
"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you." 
Elizabeth was forced to go. 
"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother, as soon as she was in the hall. "Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room." 
Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room. 
Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter. 
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband. 
After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence. 
Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes. 
But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but HER'S she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room. 
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world. 
"'Tis too much!" she added, "by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh! why is not everybody as happy?" 
Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said for the present. 
"I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried. "I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much happiness!" 
She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty. 
Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation. 
"And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!" 
In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose. 
"Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door. 
"With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say." 
He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself. 
It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was. 
Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter, and said: 
"Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman." 
Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness. 
"You are a good girl;" he replied, "and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income." 
"I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me." 
"Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet," cried his wife, "what are you talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely more." Then addressing her daughter, "Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!" 
Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense. 
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter. 
Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept. 
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief. 
"He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed it possible." 
"I suspected as much," replied Elizabeth. "But how did he account for it?" 
"It must have been his sister's doing. They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other." 
"That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that I ever heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard." 
"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of MY being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!" 
"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty." 
This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him. 
"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried Jane. "Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all! If I could but see YOU as happy! If there WERE but such another man for you!" 
"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time." 
The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton. 
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune. 
Chapter 56
One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh. 
They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt. 
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made. 
Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth, 
"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your mother." 
Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was. 
"And THAT I suppose is one of your sisters." 
"Yes, madam," said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady Catherine. "She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family." 
"You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short silence. 
"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's." 
"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west." 
Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then added: 
"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and Mrs. Collins well." 
"Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last." 
Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled. 
Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating any thing; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth, 
"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company." 
"Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and show her ladyship about the different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage." 
Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest down stairs. As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on. 
Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable. 
"How could I ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she looked in her face. 
As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner:ï¿½ 
"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come." 
Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment. 
"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here." 
"Miss Bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere YOU may choose to be, you shall not find ME so. My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I KNOW it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you." 
"If you believed it impossible to be true," said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?" 
"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted." 
"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said Elizabeth coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence." 
"If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?" 
"I never heard that it was." 
"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?" 
"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may ask questions which I shall not choose to answer." 
"This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?" 
"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible." 
"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You may have drawn him in." 
"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it." 
"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns." 
"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit." 
"Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?" 
"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me." 
Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied: 
"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of HIS mother, as well as of her's. While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?" 
"Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?" 
"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him. Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us." 
"These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth. "But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine." 
"Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person's whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment." 
"THAT will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on me." 
"I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable, honourable, and ancientï¿½though untitledï¿½families. Their fortune on both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up." 
"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal." 
"True. You ARE a gentleman's daughter. But who was your mother? Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition." 
"Whatever my connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to YOU." 
"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?" 
Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a moment's deliberation: 
"I am not." 
Lady Catherine seemed pleased. 
"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?" 
"I will make no promise of the kind." 
"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require." 
"And I certainly NEVER shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject." 
"Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying her was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is such a girl to be my nephew's sister? Is her husband, is the son of his late father's steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!ï¿½of what are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?" 
"You can now have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered. "You have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to the house." 
And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back. Her ladyship was highly incensed. 
"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?" 
"Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say. You know my sentiments." 
"You are then resolved to have him?" 
"I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to YOU, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me." 
"It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world." 
"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former WERE excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concernï¿½and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn." 
"And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point." 
In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, "I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased." 
Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself. 
"She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go." 
"She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?" 
Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible. 
Chapter 57
The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that HIS being the intimate friend of Bingley, and HER being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at Lucas lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached lady Catherine), had only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time. 
In revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how HE might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than SHE could do; and it was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with ONE, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning. 
If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way. 
"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days," she added, "I shall know how to understand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all." 
* * * * * 
The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet's curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject. 
The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand. 
"Lizzy," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into my room." 
She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations. 
She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He then said, 
"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest." 
The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued: 
"You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but I think I may defy even YOUR sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins." 
"From Mr. Collins! and what can HE have to say?" 
"Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows." "Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another; of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land." 
"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?" "This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,ï¿½splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of." 
"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out." 
"My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye." 
"MR. DARCY, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I HAVE surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his life! It is admirable!" 
Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her. 
"Are you not diverted?" 
"Oh! yes. Pray read on." 
"After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it become apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned." "Mr. Collins moreover adds," "I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing." "That is his notion of christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be Missish, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?" 
"Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I am excessively diverted. But it is so strange!" 
"Yesï¿½THAT is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but HIS perfect indifference, and YOUR pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?" 
To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much. 
Chapter 58
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same. 
They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said: 
"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your's. I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express." 
"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted." 
"You must not blame my aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them." 
"If you WILL thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone. That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your FAMILY owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought only of YOU." 
Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause, her companion added, "You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. MY affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever." 
Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable. 
They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise. 
"It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly." 
Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of THAT. After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations." 
"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence." 
"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening," said Elizabeth. "The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility." 
"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.' Those were your words. You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;ï¿½though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice." 
"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way." 
"I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me." 
"Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it." 
Darcy mentioned his letter. "Did it," said he, "did it soon make you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?" 
She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed. 
"I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me." 
"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies." 
"When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit." 
"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure." 
"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased." 
"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?" 
"Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses." 
"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong. How you must have hated me after THAT evening?" 
"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction." 
"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?" 
"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise." 
"Your surprise could not be greater than MINE in being noticed by you. My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive MORE than my due." 
"My object then," replied Darcy, "was to show you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you." 
He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend. 
She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther. 
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home. 
"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!" was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it. 
"I must ask whether you were surprised?" said Elizabeth. 
"Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen." 
"That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much." And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case. 
"On the evening before my going to London," said he, "I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together." 
Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend. 
"Did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?" 
"From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection." 
"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him." 
"It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me now." 
Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they parted. 
CHAPTER 59 
"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room, and from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a suspicion of the truth. 
The evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary. The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather KNEW that she was happy than FELT herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away. 
At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here. 
"You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!ï¿½engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible." 
"This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are engaged." 
Jane looked at her doubtingly. "Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much you dislike him." 
"You know nothing of the matter. THAT is all to be forgot. Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself." 
Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth. 
"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you," cried Jane. "My dear, dear Lizzy, I wouldï¿½I do congratulate youï¿½but are you certain? forgive the question ï¿½are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?" 
"There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?" 
"Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do any thing rather than marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?" 
"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel MORE than I ought to do, when I tell you all." 
"What do you mean?" 
"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am afraid you will be angry." 
"My dearest sister, now BE serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me how long you have loved him?" 
"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." 
Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish. 
"Now I am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another, not to you." 
Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia's marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation. 
* * * * * 
"Good gracious!" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, "if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's way." 
Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet. 
As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, "Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?" 
"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs. Bennet, "to walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view." 
"It may do very well for the others," replied Mr. Bingley; "but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won't it, Kitty?" Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying: 
"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to inconvenience." 
During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's. She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation. 
* * * * * 
In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme. She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it should be through her meansï¿½that SHE, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of herï¿½was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he wants you in the library." She was gone directly. 
Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious. "Lizzy," said he, "what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?" 
How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy. 
"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane. But will they make you happy?" 
"Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my indifference?" 
"None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him." 
"I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him. Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms." 
"Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent. He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask. I now give it to YOU, if you are resolved on having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing YOU unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are about." 
Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match. 
"Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no more to say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy." 
To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment. 
"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and WOULD have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter." 
He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to goï¿½saying, as she quitted the room, "If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure." 
Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time. 
When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself. 
"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane's is nothing to itï¿½nothing at all. I am so pleasedï¿½so happy. Such a charming man!ï¿½so handsome! so tall!ï¿½Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted." 
This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her. 
"My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else! Ten thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And a special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow." 
This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion. 
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem. 
"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he. "Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like YOUR husband quite as well as Jane's."

Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. "How could you begin?" said she. "I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?" 
"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that I HAD begun." 
"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my mannersï¿½my behaviour to YOU was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?" 
"For the liveliness of your mind, I did." 
"You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less. The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for YOUR approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike THEM. Had you not been really amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you. Thereï¿½I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of meï¿½but nobody thinks of THAT when they fall in love." 
"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was ill at Netherfield?" 
"Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?" 
"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement." 
"But I was embarrassed." 
"And so was I." 
"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner." 
"A man who had felt less, might." 
"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you WOULD have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when you WOULD have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. TOO MUCH, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the subject. This will never do." 
"You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's. My aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing." 
"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious consequence?" 
"My real purpose was to see YOU, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made." 
"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to befall her?" 
"I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But it ought to done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly." 
"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected." 
From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner's long letter; but now, having THAT to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows: 
"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed. But NOW suppose as much as you choose; give a loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas. Yours, etc." 
Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply to his last. 
"DEAR SIR, 
"I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give. 
"Yours sincerely, etc." 
Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved. 
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brother's in sending it. Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister. 
Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge. The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure. If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight. 
Mrs. Phillips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she DID speak, she must be vulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley. 
Chapter 61
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly. 
Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do. He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected. 
Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to HIS easy temper, or HER affectionate heart. The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other. 
Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going. 
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance. 
As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this effect: 
"MY DEAR LIZZY, 
"I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help. Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not. 
"Yours, etc." 
As it happened that Elizabeth had MUCH rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind. Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her. 
Though Darcy could never receive HIM at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone. 
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth. 
Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way. By Elizabeth's instructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself. 
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city. 
With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.

ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA

I.

To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard
him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses
and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt
any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that
one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but
admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect
reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a
lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never
spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They
were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the
veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner
to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely
adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which
might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a
sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power
lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a
nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and
that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable
memory.

I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us
away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the
home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first
finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to
absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of
society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in
Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from
week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the
drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still,
as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his
immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in
following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which
had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time
to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons
to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up
of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee,
and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so
delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland.
Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely
shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of
my former friend and companion.

One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was
returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to
civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I
passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated
in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the
Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes
again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.
His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw
his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against
the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head
sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who
knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their
own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his
drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new
problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which
had formerly been in part my own.

His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I
think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly
eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars,
and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he
stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular
introspective fashion.

"Wedlock suits you," he remarked. "I think, Watson, that you have
put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you."

"Seven!" I answered.

"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more,
I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not
tell me that you intended to go into harness."

"Then, how do you know?"

"I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting
yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and
careless servant girl?"

"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. You would certainly
have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true
that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful
mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you
deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has
given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it
out."

He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands
together.

"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the
inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it,
the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they
have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round
the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.
Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile
weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting
specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a
gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black
mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge
on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted
his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce
him to be an active member of the medical profession."

I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his
process of deduction. "When I hear you give your reasons," I
remarked, "the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously
simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each
successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you
explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good
as yours."

"Quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing
himself down into an armchair. "You see, but you do not observe.
The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen
the steps which lead up from the hall to this room."

"Frequently."

"How often?"

"Well, some hundreds of times."

"Then how many are there?"

"How many? I don't know."

"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is
just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps,
because I have both seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are
interested in these little problems, and since you are good
enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you
may be interested in this." He threw over a sheet of thick,
pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table.
"It came by the last post," said he. "Read it aloud."

The note was undated, and without either signature or address.

"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight
o'clock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a
matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of
the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may
safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which
can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all
quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do
not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask."

"This is indeed a mystery," I remarked. "What do you imagine that
it means?"

"I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before
one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit
theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself.
What do you deduce from it?"

I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was
written.

"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do," I remarked,
endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. "Such paper
could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly
strong and stiff."

"Peculiar--that is the very word," said Holmes. "It is not an
English paper at all. Hold it up to the light."

I did so, and saw a large "E" with a small "g," a "P," and a
large "G" with a small "t" woven into the texture of the paper.

"What do you make of that?" asked Holmes.

"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather."

"Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' stands for
'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for 'Company.' It is a
customary contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for
'Papier.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental
Gazetteer." He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves.
"Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking
country--in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 'Remarkable as being
the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous
glass-factories and paper-mills.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you
make of that?" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue
triumphant cloud from his cigarette.

"The paper was made in Bohemia," I said.

"Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you
note the peculiar construction of the sentence--'This account of
you we have from all quarters received.' A Frenchman or Russian
could not have written that. It is the German who is so
uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover
what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and
prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if
I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts."

As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and
grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the
bell. Holmes whistled.

"A pair, by the sound," said he. "Yes," he continued, glancing
out of the window. "A nice little brougham and a pair of
beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There's money in
this case, Watson, if there is nothing else."

"I think that I had better go, Holmes."

"Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my
Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity
to miss it."

"But your client--"

"Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he
comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best
attention."

A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and
in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there
was a loud and authoritative tap.

"Come in!" said Holmes.

A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six
inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His
dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked
upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed
across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while
the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined
with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch
which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended
halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with
rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence
which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a
broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper
part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black
vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment,
for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower
part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character,
with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive
of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.

"You had my note?" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a
strongly marked German accent. "I told you that I would call." He
looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to
address.

"Pray take a seat," said Holmes. "This is my friend and
colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me
in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?"

"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.
I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour
and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most
extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate
with you alone."

I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me
back into my chair. "It is both, or none," said he. "You may say
before this gentleman anything which you may say to me."

The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. "Then I must begin," said
he, "by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at
the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At
present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it
may have an influence upon European history."

"I promise," said Holmes.

"And I."

"You will excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor. "The
august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to
you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have
just called myself is not exactly my own."

"I was aware of it," said Holmes dryly.

"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution
has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense
scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of
Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House
of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia."

"I was also aware of that," murmured Holmes, settling himself
down in his armchair and closing his eyes.

Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,
lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him
as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe.
Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his
gigantic client.

"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case," he
remarked, "I should be better able to advise you."

The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in
uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he
tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. "You
are right," he cried; "I am the King. Why should I attempt to
conceal it?"

"Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes. "Your Majesty had not spoken
before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich
Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and
hereditary King of Bohemia."

"But you can understand," said our strange visitor, sitting down
once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, "you
can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in
my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not
confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I
have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting
you."

"Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.

"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a
lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known
adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you."

"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor," murmured Holmes without
opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of
docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it
was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not
at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography
sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a
staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea
fishes.

"Let me see!" said Holmes. "Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year
1858. Contralto--hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera
of Warsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! Living in
London--quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled
with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and
is now desirous of getting those letters back."

"Precisely so. But how--"

"Was there a secret marriage?"

"None."

"No legal papers or certificates?"

"None."

"Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should
produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is
she to prove their authenticity?"

"There is the writing."

"Pooh, pooh! Forgery."

"My private note-paper."

"Stolen."

"My own seal."

"Imitated."

"My photograph."

"Bought."

"We were both in the photograph."

"Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an
indiscretion."

"I was mad--insane."

"You have compromised yourself seriously."

"I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now."

"It must be recovered."

"We have tried and failed."

"Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought."

"She will not sell."

"Stolen, then."

"Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked
her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice
she has been waylaid. There has been no result."

"No sign of it?"

"Absolutely none."

Holmes laughed. "It is quite a pretty little problem," said he.

"But a very serious one to me," returned the King reproachfully.

"Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the
photograph?"

"To ruin me."

"But how?"

"I am about to be married."

"So I have heard."

"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the
King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her
family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a
doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end."

"And Irene Adler?"

"Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I
know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul
of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and
the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry
another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not
go--none."

"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?"

"I am sure."

"And why?"

"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the
betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday."

"Oh, then we have three days yet," said Holmes with a yawn. "That
is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to
look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in
London for the present?"

"Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the
Count Von Kramm."

"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress."

"Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety."

"Then, as to money?"

"You have carte blanche."

"Absolutely?"

"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom
to have that photograph."

"And for present expenses?"

The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak
and laid it on the table.

"There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in
notes," he said.

Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and
handed it to him.

"And Mademoiselle's address?" he asked.

"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood."

Holmes took a note of it. "One other question," said he. "Was the
photograph a cabinet?"

"It was."

"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon
have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson," he added,
as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. "If
you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three
o'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you."


II.

At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had
not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the
house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down
beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him,
however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his
inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and
strange features which were associated with the two crimes which
I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the
exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own.
Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my
friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of
a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a
pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the
quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most
inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable
success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to
enter into my head.

It was close upon four before the door opened, and a
drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an
inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room.
Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of
disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it
was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he
emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old.
Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in
front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.

"Well, really!" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again
until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the
chair.

"What is it?"

"It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I
employed my morning, or what I ended by doing."

"I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the
habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler."

"Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you,
however. I left the house a little after eight o'clock this
morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a
wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of
them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found
Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but
built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock
to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well
furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those
preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open.
Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window
could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round
it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without
noting anything else of interest.

"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that
there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the
garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses,
and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two
fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire
about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in
the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but
whose biographies I was compelled to listen to."

"And what of Irene Adler?" I asked.

"Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. She is
the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the
Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts,
drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for
dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings.
Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark,
handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and
often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See
the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him
home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him.
When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up
and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan
of campaign.

"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the
matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the
relation between them, and what the object of his repeated
visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the
former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his
keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this
question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony
Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the
Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my
inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to
let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the
situation."

"I am following you closely," I answered.

"I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab
drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a
remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--
evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a
great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the
maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly
at home.

"He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch
glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and
down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see
nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than
before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from
his pocket and looked at it earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he
shouted, 'first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street, and then to
the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if
you do it in twenty minutes!'

"Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do
well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau,
the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under
his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of
the buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall
door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment,
but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.

"'The Church of St. Monica, John,' she cried, 'and half a
sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'

"This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing
whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her
landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked
twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could
object. 'The Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'and half a sovereign
if you reach it in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minutes to
twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.

"My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but the
others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their
steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid
the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there
save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who
seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three
standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side
aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church.
Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to
me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards
me.

"'Thank God,' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Come!'

"'What then?' I asked.

"'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won't be legal.'

"I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was
I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear,
and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally
assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to
Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and
there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady
on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was
the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my
life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just
now. It seems that there had been some informality about their
license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them
without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance
saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in
search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean
to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion."

"This is a very unexpected turn of affairs," said I; "and what
then?"

"Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if
the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate
very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church
door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and
she to her own house. 'I shall drive out in the park at five as
usual,' she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove
away in different directions, and I went off to make my own
arrangements."

"Which are?"

"Some cold beef and a glass of beer," he answered, ringing the
bell. "I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to
be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want
your co-operation."

"I shall be delighted."

"You don't mind breaking the law?"

"Not in the least."

"Nor running a chance of arrest?"

"Not in a good cause."

"Oh, the cause is excellent!"

"Then I am your man."

"I was sure that I might rely on you."

"But what is it you wish?"

"When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to
you. Now," he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that
our landlady had provided, "I must discuss it while I eat, for I
have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must
be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns
from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her."

"And what then?"

"You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to
occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must
not interfere, come what may. You understand?"

"I am to be neutral?"

"To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small
unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being
conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the
sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close
to that open window."

"Yes."

"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you."

"Yes."

"And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what
I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of
fire. You quite follow me?"

"Entirely."

"It is nothing very formidable," he said, taking a long cigar-
shaped roll from his pocket. "It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-
rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting.
Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire,
it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then
walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten
minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?"

"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you,
and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry
of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street."

"Precisely."

"Then you may entirely rely on me."

"That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I
prepare for the new role I have to play."

He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in
the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist
clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white
tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and
benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have
equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His
expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every
fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as
science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in
crime.

It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still
wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in
Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just
being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge,
waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such
as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description,
but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On
the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was
remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men
smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his
wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and
several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with
cigars in their mouths.

"You see," remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of
the house, "this marriage rather simplifies matters. The
photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are
that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey
Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his
princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the
photograph?"

"Where, indeed?"

"It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is
cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman's
dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid
and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We
may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her."

"Where, then?"

"Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But
I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive,
and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it
over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but
she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be
brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she
had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she
can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house."

"But it has twice been burgled."

"Pshaw! They did not know how to look."

"But how will you look?"

"I will not look."

"What then?"

"I will get her to show me."

"But she will refuse."

"She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is
her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter."

As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round
the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which
rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of
the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in
the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another
loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce
quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who
took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder,
who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and
in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was
the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who
struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes
dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached
her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood
running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to
their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while
a number of better-dressed people, who had watched the scuffle
without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to
attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her,
had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her
superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking
back into the street.

"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?" she asked.

"He is dead," cried several voices.

"No, no, there's life in him!" shouted another. "But he'll be
gone before you can get him to hospital."

"He's a brave fellow," said a woman. "They would have had the
lady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him. They were a
gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he's breathing now."

"He can't lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?"

"Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable
sofa. This way, please!"

Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out
in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings
from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the
blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay
upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with
compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I
know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life
than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was
conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited
upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery
to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted
to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under
my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are
but preventing her from injuring another.

Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man
who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the
window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the
signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of "Fire!" The
word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of
spectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and
servant-maids--joined in a general shriek of "Fire!" Thick clouds
of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I
caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice
of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm.
Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner
of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my
friend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar.
He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we
had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the
Edgeware Road.

"You did it very nicely, Doctor," he remarked. "Nothing could
have been better. It is all right."

"You have the photograph?"

"I know where it is."

"And how did you find out?"

"She showed me, as I told you she would."

"I am still in the dark."

"I do not wish to make a mystery," said he, laughing. "The matter
was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the
street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening."

"I guessed as much."

"Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in
the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand
to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick."

"That also I could fathom."

"Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else
could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room
which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was
determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for
air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your
chance."

"How did that help you?"

"It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on
fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she
values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have
more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the
Darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in
the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby;
an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to
me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious
to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it.
The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were
enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The
photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the
right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a
glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it
was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed
from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making
my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to
attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had
come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to
wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all."

"And now?" I asked.

"Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King
to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be
shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is
probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the
photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain
it with his own hands."

"And when will you call?"

"At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall
have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage
may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to
the King without delay."

We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was
searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:

"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes."

There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the
greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had
hurried by.

"I've heard that voice before," said Holmes, staring down the
dimly lit street. "Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have
been."


III.

I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our
toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed
into the room.

"You have really got it!" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by
either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.

"Not yet."

"But you have hopes?"

"I have hopes."

"Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone."

"We must have a cab."

"No, my brougham is waiting."

"Then that will simplify matters." We descended and started off
once more for Briony Lodge.

"Irene Adler is married," remarked Holmes.

"Married! When?"

"Yesterday."

"But to whom?"

"To an English lawyer named Norton."

"But she could not love him."

"I am in hopes that she does."

"And why in hopes?"

"Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future
annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your
Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason
why she should interfere with your Majesty's plan."

"It is true. And yet--Well! I wish she had been of my own
station! What a queen she would have made!" He relapsed into a
moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in
Serpentine Avenue.

The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood
upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped
from the brougham.

"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.

"I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion, looking at her with a
questioning and rather startled gaze.

"Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She
left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing
Cross for the Continent."

"What!" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and
surprise. "Do you mean that she has left England?"

"Never to return."

"And the papers?" asked the King hoarsely. "All is lost."

"We shall see." He pushed past the servant and rushed into the
drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was
scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and
open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before
her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small
sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a
photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler
herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to
"Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for." My friend
tore it open and we all three read it together. It was dated at
midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:

"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it very well. You
took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a
suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I
began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had
been told that if the King employed an agent it would certainly
be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this,
you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became
suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind
old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress
myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage
of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to
watch you, ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call
them, and came down just as you departed.

"Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was
really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock
Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and
started for the Temple to see my husband.

"We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by
so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when
you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in
peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may
do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly
wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a
weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might
take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to
possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,

                                      "Very truly yours,
                                   "IRENE NORTON, nï¿½e ADLER."

"What a woman--oh, what a woman!" cried the King of Bohemia, when
we had all three read this epistle. "Did I not tell you how quick
and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen?
Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?"

"From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a
very different level to your Majesty," said Holmes coldly. "I am
sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty's business
to a more successful conclusion."

"On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the King; "nothing could be
more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The
photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire."

"I am glad to hear your Majesty say so."

"I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can
reward you. This ring--" He slipped an emerald snake ring from
his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.

"Your Majesty has something which I should value even more
highly," said Holmes.

"You have but to name it."

"This photograph!"

The King stared at him in amazement.

"Irene's photograph!" he cried. "Certainly, if you wish it."

"I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the
matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good-morning." He
bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the
King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his
chambers.

And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom
of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were
beaten by a woman's wit. He used to make merry over the
cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And
when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her
photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.



ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE

I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the
autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a
very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair.
With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when
Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door
behind me.

"You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear
Watson," he said cordially.

"I was afraid that you were engaged."

"So I am. Very much so."

"Then I can wait in the next room."

"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and
helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no
doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also."

The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of
greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small
fat-encircled eyes.

"Try the settee," said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and
putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in
judicial moods. "I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love
of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum
routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by
the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you
will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own
little adventures."

"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me," I
observed.

"You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we
went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary
Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary
combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more
daring than any effort of the imagination."

"A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting."

"You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my
view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you
until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to
be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call
upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to
be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some
time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique
things are very often connected not with the larger but with the
smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for
doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I
have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present
case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is
certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.
Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to
recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend
Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the
peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every
possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some
slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide
myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my
memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the
facts are, to the best of my belief, unique."

The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some
little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the
inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the
advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper
flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and
endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the
indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.

I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor
bore every mark of being an average commonplace British
tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey
shepherd's check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat,
unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy
Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as
an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a
wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether,
look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save
his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and
discontent upon his features.

Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook
his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances.
"Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual
labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has
been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of
writing lately, I can deduce nothing else."

Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger
upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.

"How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr.
Holmes?" he asked. "How did you know, for example, that I did
manual labour. It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's
carpenter."

"Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger
than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more
developed."

"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?"

"I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,
especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you
use an arc-and-compass breastpin."

"Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?"

"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for
five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the
elbow where you rest it upon the desk?"

"Well, but China?"

"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right
wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small
study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature
of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a
delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I
see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter
becomes even more simple."

Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. "Well, I never!" said he. "I
thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see
that there was nothing in it, after all."

"I begin to think, Watson," said Holmes, "that I make a mistake
in explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and my
poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I
am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?"

"Yes, I have got it now," he answered with his thick red finger
planted halfway down the column. "Here it is. This is what began
it all. You just read it for yourself, sir."

I took the paper from him and read as follows:

"TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late
Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now
another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a
salary of 4 pounds a week for purely nominal services. All
red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age
of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at
eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7
Pope's Court, Fleet Street."

"What on earth does this mean?" I ejaculated after I had twice
read over the extraordinary announcement.

Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when
in high spirits. "It is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?"
said he. "And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us
all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this
advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note,
Doctor, of the paper and the date."

"It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months
ago."

"Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?"

"Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock
Holmes," said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; "I have a small
pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square, near the City. It's not a
very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than
just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants,
but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but
that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the
business."

"What is the name of this obliging youth?" asked Sherlock Holmes.

"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth,
either. It's hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter
assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better
himself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after
all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?"

"Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employï¿½ who
comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience
among employers in this age. I don't know that your assistant is
not as remarkable as your advertisement."

"Oh, he has his faults, too," said Mr. Wilson. "Never was such a
fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought
to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar
like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his
main fault, but on the whole he's a good worker. There's no vice
in him."

"He is still with you, I presume?"

"Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple
cooking and keeps the place clean--that's all I have in the
house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very
quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads
and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.

"The first thing that put us out was that advertisement.
Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight
weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:

"'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.'

"'Why that?' I asks.

"'Why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy on the League of the
Red-headed Men. It's worth quite a little fortune to any man who
gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than
there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits' end what
to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here's
a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.'

"'Why, what is it, then?' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a
very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of
my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting
my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn't know much of what
was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.

"'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?' he
asked with his eyes open.

"'Never.'

"'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one
of the vacancies.'

"'And what are they worth?' I asked.

"'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight,
and it need not interfere very much with one's other
occupations.'

"Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears,
for the business has not been over-good for some years, and an
extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.

"'Tell me all about it,' said I.

"'Well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see for
yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address
where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out,
the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah
Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself
red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men;
so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous
fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the
interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of
that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to
do.'

"'But,' said I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men who
would apply.'

"'Not so many as you might think,' he answered. 'You see it is
really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had
started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the
old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your
applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but
real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr.
Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be
worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a
few hundred pounds.'

"Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves,
that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed
to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I
stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent
Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might
prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for
the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to
have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for
the address that was given us in the advertisement.

"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From
north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in
his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement.
Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's Court
looked like a coster's orange barrow. I should not have thought
there were so many in the whole country as were brought together
by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they
were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay;
but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real
vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I
would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear
of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and
pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up
to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream
upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back
dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found
ourselves in the office."

"Your experience has been a most entertaining one," remarked
Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge
pinch of snuff. "Pray continue your very interesting statement."

"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs
and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that
was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate
as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in
them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem
to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn
came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of
the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he
might have a private word with us.

"'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is
willing to fill a vacancy in the League.'

"'And he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'He has
every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so
fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and
gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he
plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my
success.

"'It would be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'You will,
however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.'
With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I
yelled with the pain. 'There is water in your eyes,' said he as
he released me. 'I perceive that all is as it should be. But we
have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and
once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which
would disgust you with human nature.' He stepped over to the
window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the
vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below,
and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there
was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the
manager.

"'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of
the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are
you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?'

"I answered that I had not.

"His face fell immediately.

"'Dear me!' he said gravely, 'that is very serious indeed! I am
sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the
propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their
maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a
bachelor.'

"My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was
not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for
a few minutes he said that it would be all right.

"'In the case of another,' said he, 'the objection might be
fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a
head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your
new duties?'

"'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,'
said I.

"'Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!' said Vincent Spaulding.
'I should be able to look after that for you.'

"'What would be the hours?' I asked.

"'Ten to two.'

"Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening, Mr.
Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just
before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in
the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man,
and that he would see to anything that turned up.

"'That would suit me very well,' said I. 'And the pay?'

"'Is 4 pounds a week.'

"'And the work?'

"'Is purely nominal.'

"'What do you call purely nominal?'

"'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the
building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole
position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You
don't comply with the conditions if you budge from the office
during that time.'

"'It's only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,'
said I.

"'No excuse will avail,' said Mr. Duncan Ross; 'neither sickness
nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose
your billet.'

"'And the work?'

"'Is to copy out the "Encyclopaedia Britannica." There is the first
volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and
blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be
ready to-morrow?'

"'Certainly,' I answered.

"'Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you
once more on the important position which you have been fortunate
enough to gain.' He bowed me out of the room and I went home with
my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased
at my own good fortune.

"Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in
low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the
whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its
object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past
belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay
such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the
'Encyclopaedia Britannica.' Vincent Spaulding did what he could to
cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the
whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look
at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a
quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for
Pope's Court.

"Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as
possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross
was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off
upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from
time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o'clock he
bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had
written, and locked the door of the office after me.

"This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the
manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my
week's work. It was the same next week, and the same the week
after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I
left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only
once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at
all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an
instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet
was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk
the loss of it.

"Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about
Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and
hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B's before very
long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly
filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole
business came to an end."

"To an end?"

"Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as
usual at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a
little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the
panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself."

He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet
of note-paper. It read in this fashion:

                  THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE

                           IS

                        DISSOLVED.

                     October 9, 1890.

Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the
rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so
completely overtopped every other consideration that we both
burst out into a roar of laughter.

"I cannot see that there is anything very funny," cried our
client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. "If you can
do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere."

"No, no," cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from
which he had half risen. "I really wouldn't miss your case for
the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you
will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it.
Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the
door?"

"I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called
at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything
about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant
living on the ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me
what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had
never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan
Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.

"'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.'

"'What, the red-headed man?'

"'Yes.'

"'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor
and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new
premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.'

"'Where could I find him?'

"'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17
King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.'

"I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was
a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever
heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross."

"And what did you do then?" asked Holmes.

"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my
assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say
that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite
good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place
without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough
to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right
away to you."

"And you did very wisely," said Holmes. "Your case is an
exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it.
From what you have told me I think that it is possible that
graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear."

"Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. "Why, I have lost four
pound a week."

"As far as you are personally concerned," remarked Holmes, "I do
not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary
league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some
30 pounds, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have
gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have
lost nothing by them."

"No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are,
and what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a
prank--upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it
cost them two and thirty pounds."

"We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first,
one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who
first called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he
been with you?"

"About a month then."

"How did he come?"

"In answer to an advertisement."

"Was he the only applicant?"

"No, I had a dozen."

"Why did you pick him?"

"Because he was handy and would come cheap."

"At half-wages, in fact."

"Yes."

"What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?"

"Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,
though he's not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon
his forehead."

Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. "I thought
as much," said he. "Have you ever observed that his ears are
pierced for earrings?"

"Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he
was a lad."

"Hum!" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. "He is still
with you?"

"Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him."

"And has your business been attended to in your absence?"

"Nothing to complain of, sir. There's never very much to do of a
morning."

"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an
opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is
Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion."

"Well, Watson," said Holmes when our visitor had left us, "what
do you make of it all?"

"I make nothing of it," I answered frankly. "It is a most
mysterious business."

"As a rule," said Holmes, "the more bizarre a thing is the less
mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless
crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is
the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this
matter."

"What are you going to do, then?" I asked.

"To smoke," he answered. "It is quite a three pipe problem, and I
beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes." He curled
himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his
hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his
black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird.
I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and
indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his
chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put
his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.

"Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon," he
remarked. "What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare
you for a few hours?"

"I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very
absorbing."

"Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City
first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that
there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is
rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is
introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!"

We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short
walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular
story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky,
little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy
two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in
enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded
laurel-bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and
uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with
"JABEZ WILSON" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced
the place where our red-headed client carried on his business.
Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side
and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between
puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down
again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally
he returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously
upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up
to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a
bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step
in.

"Thank you," said Holmes, "I only wished to ask you how you would
go from here to the Strand."

"Third right, fourth left," answered the assistant promptly,
closing the door.

"Smart fellow, that," observed Holmes as we walked away. "He is,
in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring
I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known
something of him before."

"Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good
deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you
inquired your way merely in order that you might see him."

"Not him."

"What then?"

"The knees of his trousers."

"And what did you see?"

"What I expected to see."

"Why did you beat the pavement?"

"My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We
are spies in an enemy's country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg
Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it."

The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the
corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a
contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was
one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City
to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense
stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward,
while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of
pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line
of fine shops and stately business premises that they really
abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square
which we had just quitted.

"Let me see," said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing
along the line, "I should like just to remember the order of the
houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of
London. There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist, the little
newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank,
the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building
depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now,
Doctor, we've done our work, so it's time we had some play. A
sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where
all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no
red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums."

My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a
very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All
the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect
happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the
music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes
were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the
relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was
possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature
alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and
astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction
against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally
predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from
extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was
never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been
lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his
black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase
would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning
power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were
unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a
man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him
that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I
felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set
himself to hunt down.

"You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor," he remarked as we
emerged.

"Yes, it would be as well."

"And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This
business at Coburg Square is serious."

"Why serious?"

"A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to
believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being
Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help
to-night."

"At what time?"

"Ten will be early enough."

"I shall be at Baker Street at ten."

"Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger,
so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket." He waved his
hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the
crowd.

I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was
always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings
with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had
seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that
he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to
happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and
grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought
over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed
copier of the "Encyclopaedia" down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg
Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me.
What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?
Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from
Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a
formidable man--a man who might play a deep game. I tried to
puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside
until night should bring an explanation.

It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my
way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker
Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered
the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering
his room I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men,
one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police
agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a
very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.

"Ha! Our party is complete," said Holmes, buttoning up his
pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack.
"Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me
introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in
to-night's adventure."

"We're hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see," said Jones in
his consequential way. "Our friend here is a wonderful man for
starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do
the running down."

"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,"
observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.

"You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir," said
the police agent loftily. "He has his own little methods, which
are, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical
and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It
is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of
the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly
correct than the official force."

"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right," said the
stranger with deference. "Still, I confess that I miss my rubber.
It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I
have not had my rubber."

"I think you will find," said Sherlock Holmes, "that you will
play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and
that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather,
the stake will be some 30,000 pounds; and for you, Jones, it will
be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands."

"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He's a
young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his
profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on
any criminal in London. He's a remarkable man, is young John
Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been
to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and
though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to
find the man himself. He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week,
and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.
I've been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him
yet."

"I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night.
I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I
agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is
past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two
will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the
second."

Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive
and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in
the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit
streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.

"We are close there now," my friend remarked. "This fellow
Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the
matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is
not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession.
He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as
tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we
are, and they are waiting for us."

We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had
found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and,
following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a
narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us.
Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive
iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding
stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr.
Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us
down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a
third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all
round with crates and massive boxes.

"You are not very vulnerable from above," Holmes remarked as he
held up the lantern and gazed about him.

"Nor from below," said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon
the flags which lined the floor. "Why, dear me, it sounds quite
hollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise.

"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!" said Holmes
severely. "You have already imperilled the whole success of our
expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit
down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"

The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a
very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his
knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens,
began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few
seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again
and put his glass in his pocket.

"We have at least an hour before us," he remarked, "for they can
hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed.
Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their
work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at
present, Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of
the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr.
Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to
you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of
London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at
present."

"It is our French gold," whispered the director. "We have had
several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it."

"Your French gold?"

"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources
and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of
France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to
unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The
crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between
layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at
present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the
directors have had misgivings upon the subject."

"Which were very well justified," observed Holmes. "And now it is
time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an
hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr.
Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern."

"And sit in the dark?"

"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and
I thought that, as we were a partie carrï¿½e, you might have your
rubber after all. But I see that the enemy's preparations have
gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And,
first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men,
and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us
some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate,
and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a
light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no
compunction about shooting them down."

I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case
behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front
of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute
darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot
metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready
to flash out at a moment's notice. To me, with my nerves worked
up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and
subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the
vault.

"They have but one retreat," whispered Holmes. "That is back
through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have
done what I asked you, Jones?"

"I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door."

"Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent
and wait."

What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but
an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must
have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs
were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my
nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my
hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle
breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper,
heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note
of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case
in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint
of a light.

At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then
it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then,
without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand
appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the
centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the
hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then
it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark
again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between
the stones.

Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending,
tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon
its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed
the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut,
boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand
on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and
waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another
instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after
him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face
and a shock of very red hair.

"It's all clear," he whispered. "Have you the chisel and the
bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I'll swing for it!"

Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the
collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of
rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed
upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes' hunting crop came
down on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone
floor.

"It's no use, John Clay," said Holmes blandly. "You have no
chance at all."

"So I see," the other answered with the utmost coolness. "I fancy
that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his
coat-tails."

"There are three men waiting for him at the door," said Holmes.

"Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I
must compliment you."

"And I you," Holmes answered. "Your red-headed idea was very new
and effective."

"You'll see your pal again presently," said Jones. "He's quicker
at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the
derbies."

"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,"
remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists.
"You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have
the goodness, also, when you address me always to say 'sir' and
'please.'"

"All right," said Jones with a stare and a snigger. "Well, would
you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry
your Highness to the police-station?"

"That is better," said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow
to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the
detective.

"Really, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them
from the cellar, "I do not know how the bank can thank you or
repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated
in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts
at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience."

"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr.
John Clay," said Holmes. "I have been at some small expense over
this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond
that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in
many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of
the Red-headed League."


"You see, Watson," he explained in the early hours of the morning
as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, "it
was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible
object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of
the League, and the copying of the 'Encyclopaedia,' must be to get
this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of
hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but,
really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was
no doubt suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his
accomplice's hair. The 4 pounds a week was a lure which must draw
him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands?
They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary
office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and
together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the
week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for
half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive
for securing the situation."

"But how could you guess what the motive was?"

"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a
mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The
man's business was a small one, and there was nothing in his
house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and
such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something
out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant's
fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the
cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then
I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I
had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in
London. He was doing something in the cellar--something which
took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once
more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel
to some other building.

"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I
surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was
ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind.
It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the
assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had
never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his
face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have
remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of
those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they
were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and
Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that I
had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I
called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank
directors, with the result that you have seen."

"And how could you tell that they would make their attempt
to-night?" I asked.

"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that
they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence--in other
words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential
that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the
bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than
any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape.
For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night."

"You reasoned it out beautifully," I exclaimed in unfeigned
admiration. "It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings
true."

"It saved me from ennui," he answered, yawning. "Alas! I already
feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort
to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little
problems help me to do so."

"And you are a benefactor of the race," said I.

He shrugged his shoulders. "Well, perhaps, after all, it is of
some little use," he remarked. "'L'homme c'est rien--l'oeuvre
c'est tout,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand."



ADVENTURE III. A CASE OF IDENTITY

"My dear fellow," said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side
of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, "life is infinitely
stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We
would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere
commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window
hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the
roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the
strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the
wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and
leading to the most outrï¿½ results, it would make all fiction with
its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and
unprofitable."

"And yet I am not convinced of it," I answered. "The cases which
come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and
vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to
its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed,
neither fascinating nor artistic."

"A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a
realistic effect," remarked Holmes. "This is wanting in the
police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the
platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an
observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend
upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace."

I smiled and shook my head. "I can quite understand your thinking
so." I said. "Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser
and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout
three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is
strange and bizarre. But here"--I picked up the morning paper
from the ground--"let us put it to a practical test. Here is the
first heading upon which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his
wife.' There is half a column of print, but I know without
reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of
course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the
bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of
writers could invent nothing more crude."

"Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,"
said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. "This
is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged
in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The
husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the
conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of
winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling
them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely
to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a
pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over
you in your example."

He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in
the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his
homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon
it.

"Ah," said he, "I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks.
It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my
assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers."

"And the ring?" I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which
sparkled upon his finger.

"It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in
which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it
even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of
my little problems."

"And have you any on hand just now?" I asked with interest.

"Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of
interest. They are important, you understand, without being
interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in
unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation,
and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the
charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the
simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is
the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter
which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing
which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however,
that I may have something better before very many minutes are
over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken."

He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted
blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street.
Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite
there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck,
and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was
tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her
ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous,
hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated
backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove
buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves
the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp
clang of the bell.

"I have seen those symptoms before," said Holmes, throwing his
cigarette into the fire. "Oscillation upon the pavement always
means an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure
that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet
even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously
wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom
is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love
matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or
grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts."

As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons
entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself
loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed
merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed
her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and,
having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked
her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was
peculiar to him.

"Do you not find," he said, "that with your short sight it is a
little trying to do so much typewriting?"

"I did at first," she answered, "but now I know where the letters
are without looking." Then, suddenly realising the full purport
of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear
and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. "You've
heard about me, Mr. Holmes," she cried, "else how could you know
all that?"

"Never mind," said Holmes, laughing; "it is my business to know
things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others
overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?"

"I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege,
whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had
given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as
much for me. I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in
my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and
I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?" asked
Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to
the ceiling.

Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss
Mary Sutherland. "Yes, I did bang out of the house," she said,
"for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr.
Windibank--that is, my father--took it all. He would not go to
the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he
would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done,
it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away
to you."

"Your father," said Holmes, "your stepfather, surely, since the
name is different."

"Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny,
too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself."

"And your mother is alive?"

"Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr.
Holmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, and
a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father
was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy
business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the
foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the
business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines.
They got 4700 pounds for the goodwill and interest, which wasn't
near as much as father could have got if he had been alive."

I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this
rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he
had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.

"Your own little income," he asked, "does it come out of the
business?"

"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle
Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/2 per
cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can
only touch the interest."

"You interest me extremely," said Holmes. "And since you draw so
large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the
bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in
every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely
upon an income of about 60 pounds."

"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you
understand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a
burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while
I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the
time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it
over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I
earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can
often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day."

"You have made your position very clear to me," said Holmes.
"This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as
freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your
connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel."

A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked
nervously at the fringe of her jacket. "I met him first at the
gasfitters' ball," she said. "They used to send father tickets
when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and
sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He
never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I
wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I
was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to
prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all
father's friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing
fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much
as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do,
he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went,
mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it
was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"I suppose," said Holmes, "that when Mr. Windibank came back from
France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball."

"Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and
shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying
anything to a woman, for she would have her way."

"I see. Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a
gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if
we had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that is to
say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father
came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house
any more."

"No?"

"Well, you know father didn't like anything of the sort. He
wouldn't have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to
say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But
then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to
begin with, and I had not got mine yet."

"But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see
you?"

"Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer
wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each
other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he
used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so
there was no need for father to know."

"Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?"

"Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that
we took. Hosmer--Mr. Angel--was a cashier in an office in
Leadenhall Street--and--"

"What office?"

"That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don't know."

"Where did he live, then?"

"He slept on the premises."

"And you don't know his address?"

"No--except that it was Leadenhall Street."

"Where did you address your letters, then?"

"To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called
for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be
chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady,
so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't
have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come
from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the
machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he
was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think
of."

"It was most suggestive," said Holmes. "It has long been an axiom
of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important.
Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?"

"He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me
in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to
be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his
voice was gentle. He'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he
was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat,
and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always
well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just
as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare."

"Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather,
returned to France?"

"Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we
should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest
and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever
happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite
right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion.
Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder
of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the
week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to
mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother
said she would make it all right with him. I didn't quite like
that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as
he was only a few years older than me; but I didn't want to do
anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the
company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on
the very morning of the wedding."

"It missed him, then?"

"Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived."

"Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for
the Friday. Was it to be in church?"

"Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour's, near
King's Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St.
Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were
two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a
four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the
street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler
drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and
when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one
there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become
of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was
last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything
since then to throw any light upon what became of him."

"It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated," said
Holmes.

"Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all
the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to
be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to
separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him,
and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed
strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since
gives a meaning to it."

"Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some
unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?"

"Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he
would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw
happened."

"But you have no notion as to what it could have been?"

"None."

"One more question. How did your mother take the matter?"

"She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter
again."

"And your father? Did you tell him?"

"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had
happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said,
what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of
the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my
money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him,
there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about
money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what
could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me
half-mad to think of it, and I can't sleep a wink at night." She
pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob
heavily into it.

"I shall glance into the case for you," said Holmes, rising, "and
I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the
weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind
dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel
vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life."

"Then you don't think I'll see him again?"

"I fear not."

"Then what has happened to him?"

"You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an
accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can
spare."

"I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle," said she.
"Here is the slip and here are four letters from him."

"Thank you. And your address?"

"No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell."

"Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is your
father's place of business?"

"He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers
of Fenchurch Street."

"Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will
leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given
you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it
to affect your life."

"You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be
true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back."

For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was
something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which
compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon
the table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever
she might be summoned.

Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips
still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him,
and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down
from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a
counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with
the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of
infinite languor in his face.

"Quite an interesting study, that maiden," he observed. "I found
her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way,
is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you
consult my index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of
the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however,
there were one or two details which were new to me. But the
maiden herself was most instructive."

"You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite
invisible to me," I remarked.

"Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to
look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring
you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of
thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace.
Now, what did you gather from that woman's appearance? Describe
it."

"Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a
feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads
sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her
dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little
purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and
were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn't
observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a
general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable,
easy-going way."

Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.

"'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have
really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed
everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and
you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general
impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My
first glance is always at a woman's sleeve. In a man it is
perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you
observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most
useful material for showing traces. The double line a little
above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table,
was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type,
leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side
of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the
broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and,
observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I
ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed
to surprise her."

"It surprised me."

"But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and
interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots
which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were
really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and
the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower
buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and
fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly
dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned,
it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry."

"And what else?" I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by
my friend's incisive reasoning.

"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving
home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right
glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see
that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had
written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been
this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger.
All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back
to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised
description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?"

I held the little printed slip to the light.

"Missing," it said, "on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman
named Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height;
strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in
the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted
glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen,
in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert
chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over
elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in
Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing--"

"That will do," said Holmes. "As to the letters," he continued,
glancing over them, "they are very commonplace. Absolutely no
clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There
is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike
you."

"They are typewritten," I remarked.

"Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the
neat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom. There is a date, you
see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is
rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive
--in fact, we may call it conclusive."

"Of what?"

"My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it
bears upon the case?"

"I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able
to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were
instituted."

"No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters,
which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the
other is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking
him whether he could meet us here at six o'clock tomorrow
evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the
male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the
answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem
upon the shelf for the interim."

I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers
of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that
he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy
demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had
been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in
the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler
photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the
Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with
the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle
indeed which he could not unravel.

I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the
conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would
find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up
to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary
Sutherland.

A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own
attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at
the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six
o'clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a
hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too
late to assist at the dï¿½nouement of the little mystery. I found
Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin
form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable
array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell
of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the
chemical work which was so dear to him.

"Well, have you solved it?" I asked as I entered.

"Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta."

"No, no, the mystery!" I cried.

"Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon.
There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said
yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback
is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel."

"Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss
Sutherland?"

The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet
opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the
passage and a tap at the door.

"This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank," said
Holmes. "He has written to me to say that he would be here at
six. Come in!"

The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some
thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a
bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and
penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of
us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a
slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.

"Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "I think that
this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an
appointment with me for six o'clock?"

"Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not
quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland
has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far
better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite
against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable,
impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily
controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I
did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the
official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family
misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless
expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?"

"On the contrary," said Holmes quietly; "I have every reason to
believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel."

Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. "I am
delighted to hear it," he said.

"It is a curious thing," remarked Holmes, "that a typewriter has
really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting. Unless
they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some
letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one
side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that
in every case there is some little slurring over of the 'e,' and
a slight defect in the tail of the 'r.' There are fourteen other
characteristics, but those are the more obvious."

"We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office,
and no doubt it is a little worn," our visitor answered, glancing
keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.

"And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study,
Mr. Windibank," Holmes continued. "I think of writing another
little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its
relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some
little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come
from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not
only are the 'e's' slurred and the 'r's' tailless, but you will
observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen
other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well."

Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. "I
cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,"
he said. "If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know
when you have done it."

"Certainly," said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in
the door. "I let you know, then, that I have caught him!"

"What! where?" shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips
and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.

"Oh, it won't do--really it won't," said Holmes suavely. "There
is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too
transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that
it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That's
right! Sit down and let us talk it over."

Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a
glitter of moisture on his brow. "It--it's not actionable," he
stammered.

"I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves,
Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a
petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the
course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong."

The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his
breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up
on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands
in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed,
than to us.

"The man married a woman very much older than himself for her
money," said he, "and he enjoyed the use of the money of the
daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable
sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have
made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it.
The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate
and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with
her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would
not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would
mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her
stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of
keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of
people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not
answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and
finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain
ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an
idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the
connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself,
covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with
a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice
into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the
girl's short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off
other lovers by making love himself."

"It was only a joke at first," groaned our visitor. "We never
thought that she would have been so carried away."

"Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very
decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that
her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never
for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the
gentleman's attentions, and the effect was increased by the
loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began
to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as
far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There
were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the
girl's affections from turning towards anyone else. But the
deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys
to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to
bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it
would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind and
prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to
come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and
hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening
on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss
Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to
his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not
listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her,
and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished
away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a
four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of
events, Mr. Windibank!"

Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes
had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold
sneer upon his pale face.

"It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes," said he, "but if you
are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is
you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing
actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door
locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal
constraint."

"The law cannot, as you say, touch you," said Holmes, unlocking
and throwing open the door, "yet there never was a man who
deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a
friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!"
he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon
the man's face, "it is not part of my duties to my client, but
here's a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat
myself to--" He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he
could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs,
the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr.
James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.

"There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!" said Holmes, laughing, as he
threw himself down into his chair once more. "That fellow will
rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and
ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not
entirely devoid of interest."

"I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning," I
remarked.

"Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr.
Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious
conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really
profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the
stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together,
but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was
suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice,
which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My
suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in
typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his
handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even
the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts,
together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same
direction."

"And how did you verify them?"

"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I
knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed
description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the
result of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I
sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me
whether it answered to the description of any of their
travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the
typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business
address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his
reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but
characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from
Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the
description tallied in every respect with that of their employï¿½,
James Windibank. Voilï¿½ tout!"

"And Miss Sutherland?"

"If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old
Persian saying, 'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger
cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.'
There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much
knowledge of the world."



ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY

We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the
maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran
in this way:

"Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from
the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy.
Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect.
Leave Paddington by the 11:15."

"What do you say, dear?" said my wife, looking across at me.
"Will you go?"

"I really don't know what to say. I have a fairly long list at
present."

"Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking
a little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good,
and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' cases."

"I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained
through one of them," I answered. "But if I am to go, I must pack
at once, for I have only half an hour."

My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the
effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were
few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a
cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock
Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt
figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey
travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.

"It is really very good of you to come, Watson," said he. "It
makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on
whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless
or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall
get the tickets."

We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of
papers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged
and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until
we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a
gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.

"Have you heard anything of the case?" he asked.

"Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days."

"The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just
been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the
particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those
simple cases which are so extremely difficult."

"That sounds a little paradoxical."

"But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a
clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more
difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they
have established a very serious case against the son of the
murdered man."

"It is a murder, then?"

"Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for
granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into
it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have
been able to understand it, in a very few words.

"Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in
Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a
Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned
some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he
held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was
also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the
colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to
settle down they should do so as near each other as possible.
Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his
tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect
equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son,
a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same
age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have
avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to
have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of
sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the
neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants--a man and a girl.
Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the
least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the
families. Now for the facts.

"On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at
Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the
Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out
of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been
out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told
the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of
importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came
back alive.

"From Hatherley Farm-house to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a
mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One
was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was
William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both
these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The
game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr.
McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the
same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the
father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was
following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in
the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.

"The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder,
the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly
wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the
edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of
the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the
woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she
saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr.
McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a
violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very
strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his
hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their
violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached
home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near
Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to
fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came
running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead
in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was
much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right
hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On
following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the
grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated
blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as
might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's
gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the
body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly
arrested, and a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned
at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the
magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next
Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out
before the coroner and the police-court."

"I could hardly imagine a more damning case," I remarked. "If
ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so
here."

"Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing," answered Holmes
thoughtfully. "It may seem to point very straight to one thing,
but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it
pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something
entirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case
looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very
possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people
in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the
daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his
innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect
in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in
his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the
case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are
flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly
digesting their breakfasts at home."

"I am afraid," said I, "that the facts are so obvious that you
will find little credit to be gained out of this case."

"There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact," he
answered, laughing. "Besides, we may chance to hit upon some
other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to
Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting
when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by
means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of
understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly
perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand
side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted
even so self-evident a thing as that."

"How on earth--"

"My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness
which characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this
season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less
and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until
it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the
jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated
than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking
at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a
result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and
inference. Therein lies my mï¿½tier, and it is just possible that
it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before
us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in
the inquest, and which are worth considering."

"What are they?"

"It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after
the return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary
informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not
surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts.
This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any
traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the
coroner's jury."

"It was a confession," I ejaculated.

"No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence."

"Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at
least a most suspicious remark."

"On the contrary," said Holmes, "it is the brightest rift which I
can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be,
he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the
circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared
surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I
should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such
surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances,
and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His
frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent
man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and
firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not
unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of
his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day
so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and
even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so
important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The
self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark
appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a
guilty one."

I shook my head. "Many men have been hanged on far slighter
evidence," I remarked.

"So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged."

"What is the young man's own account of the matter?"

"It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters,
though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive.
You will find it here, and may read it for yourself."

He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire
paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the
paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own
statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the
corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this
way:

"Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called
and gave evidence as follows: 'I had been away from home for
three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the
morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at
the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he
had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after
my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and,
looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out
of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was
going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of
the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit
warren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William
Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but
he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had
no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards
from the pool I heard a cry of "Cooee!" which was a usual signal
between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found
him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at
seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A
conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows,
for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his
passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned
towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards,
however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me
to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground,
with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in
my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for
some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner's lodge-keeper,
his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one
near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by
his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and
forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no
active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.'

"The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before
he died?

"Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some
allusion to a rat.

"The Coroner: What did you understand by that?

"Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was
delirious.

"The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father
had this final quarrel?

"Witness: I should prefer not to answer.

"The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.

"Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can
assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which
followed.

"The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point
out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case
considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.

"Witness: I must still refuse.

"The Coroner: I understand that the cry of 'Cooee' was a common
signal between you and your father?

"Witness: It was.

"The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw
you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?

"Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.

"A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions
when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father
fatally injured?

"Witness: Nothing definite.

"The Coroner: What do you mean?

"Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into
the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet
I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay
upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be
something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps.
When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was
gone.

"'Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?'

"'Yes, it was gone.'

"'You cannot say what it was?'

"'No, I had a feeling something was there.'

"'How far from the body?'

"'A dozen yards or so.'

"'And how far from the edge of the wood?'

"'About the same.'

"'Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen
yards of it?'

"'Yes, but with my back towards it.'

"This concluded the examination of the witness."

"I see," said I as I glanced down the column, "that the coroner
in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy.
He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his
father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his
refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and
his singular account of his father's dying words. They are all,
as he remarks, very much against the son."

Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon
the cushioned seat. "Both you and the coroner have been at some
pains," said he, "to single out the very strongest points in the
young man's favour. Don't you see that you alternately give him
credit for having too much imagination and too little? Too
little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would
give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from
his own inner consciousness anything so outrï¿½ as a dying
reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No,
sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what
this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that
hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and
not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the
scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be
there in twenty minutes."

It was nearly four o'clock when we at last, after passing through
the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn,
found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A
lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for
us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and
leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic
surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of
Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a
room had already been engaged for us.

"I have ordered a carriage," said Lestrade as we sat over a cup
of tea. "I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be
happy until you had been on the scene of the crime."

"It was very nice and complimentary of you," Holmes answered. "It
is entirely a question of barometric pressure."

Lestrade looked startled. "I do not quite follow," he said.

"How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud
in the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need
smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country
hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I
shall use the carriage to-night."

Lestrade laughed indulgently. "You have, no doubt, already formed
your conclusions from the newspapers," he said. "The case is as
plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer
it becomes. Still, of course, one can't refuse a lady, and such a
very positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your
opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing
which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my
soul! here is her carriage at the door."

He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the
most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her
violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her
cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her
overpowering excitement and concern.

"Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!" she cried, glancing from one to the
other of us, and finally, with a woman's quick intuition,
fastening upon my companion, "I am so glad that you have come. I
have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn't do it.
I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it,
too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each
other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no
one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a
charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him."

"I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner," said Sherlock Holmes.
"You may rely upon my doing all that I can."

"But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion?
Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself
think that he is innocent?"

"I think that it is very probable."

"There, now!" she cried, throwing back her head and looking
defiantly at Lestrade. "You hear! He gives me hopes."

Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am afraid that my colleague
has been a little quick in forming his conclusions," he said.

"But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did
it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the
reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because
I was concerned in it."

"In what way?" asked Holmes.

"It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had
many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that
there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always
loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young
and has seen very little of life yet, and--and--well, he
naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there
were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them."

"And your father?" asked Holmes. "Was he in favour of such a
union?"

"No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in
favour of it." A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as
Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.

"Thank you for this information," said he. "May I see your father
if I call to-morrow?"

"I am afraid the doctor won't allow it."

"The doctor?"

"Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for
years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken
to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his
nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive
who had known dad in the old days in Victoria."

"Ha! In Victoria! That is important."

"Yes, at the mines."

"Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner
made his money."

"Yes, certainly."

"Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to
me."

"You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you
will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do
tell him that I know him to be innocent."

"I will, Miss Turner."

"I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if
I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking." She
hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we
heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.

"I am ashamed of you, Holmes," said Lestrade with dignity after a
few minutes' silence. "Why should you raise up hopes which you
are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I
call it cruel."

"I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy," said
Holmes. "Have you an order to see him in prison?"

"Yes, but only for you and me."

"Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have
still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?"

"Ample."

"Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very
slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours."

I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through
the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel,
where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a
yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin,
however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were
groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the
action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and
gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the
day. Supposing that this unhappy young man's story were
absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely
unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between
the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when,
drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was
something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the
nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts?
I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which
contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon's
deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left
parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been
shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot
upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from
behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when
seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it
did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his
back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call
Holmes' attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying
reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be
delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become
delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how
he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my
brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident
of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the
murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his
overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to
return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was
kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a
tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I
did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much faith
in Sherlock Holmes' insight that I could not lose hope as long
as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young
McCarthy's innocence.

It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone,
for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.

"The glass still keeps very high," he remarked as he sat down.
"It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able
to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his
very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not
wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young
McCarthy."

"And what did you learn from him?"

"Nothing."

"Could he throw no light?"

"None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew
who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced
now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very
quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think,
sound at heart."

"I cannot admire his taste," I remarked, "if it is indeed a fact
that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as
this Miss Turner."

"Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly,
insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was
only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away
five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get
into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a
registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can
imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not
doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows
to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort
which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father,
at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss
Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself,
and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would
have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with
his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in
Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that
point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however,
for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious
trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and
has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the
Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I
think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all
that he has suffered."

"But if he is innocent, who has done it?"

"Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two
points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with
someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his
son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would
return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry
'Cooee!' before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the
crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk
about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all
minor matters until to-morrow."

There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke
bright and cloudless. At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with
the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe
Pool.

"There is serious news this morning," Lestrade observed. "It is
said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is
despaired of."

"An elderly man, I presume?" said Holmes.

"About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life
abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This
business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend
of McCarthy's, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I
have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free."

"Indeed! That is interesting," said Holmes.

"Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody
about here speaks of his kindness to him."

"Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this
McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have
been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of
marrying his son to Turner's daughter, who is, presumably,
heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner,
as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would
follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself
was averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not
deduce something from that?"

"We have got to the deductions and the inferences," said
Lestrade, winking at me. "I find it hard enough to tackle facts,
Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies."

"You are right," said Holmes demurely; "you do find it very hard
to tackle the facts."

"Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it
difficult to get hold of," replied Lestrade with some warmth.

"And that is--"

"That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that
all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine."

"Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog," said Holmes,
laughing. "But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley
Farm upon the left."

"Yes, that is it." It was a widespread, comfortable-looking
building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches
of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless
chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight
of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door,
when the maid, at Holmes' request, showed us the boots which her
master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the
son's, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured
these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes
desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed
the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.

Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent
as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of
Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed
and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines,
while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter.
His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips
compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long,
sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal
lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated
upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell
unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick,
impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way
along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of
the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is
all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon
the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either
side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and
once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and
I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous,
while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the
conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a
definite end.

The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water
some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the
Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner.
Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see
the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich
landowner's dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods
grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass
twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds
which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which
the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground,
that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the
fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager
face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read
upon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking
up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.

"What did you go into the pool for?" he asked.

"I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon
or other trace. But how on earth--"

"Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its
inward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and
there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all
have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo
and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the
lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or
eight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of
the same feet." He drew out a lens and lay down upon his
waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to
himself than to us. "These are young McCarthy's feet. Twice he
was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are
deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his
story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are
the father's feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It
is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this?
Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite
unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again--of course
that was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?" He ran up
and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we
were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a
great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced
his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon
his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he
remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks,
gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and
examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of
the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among
the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then
he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the
highroad, where all traces were lost.

"It has been a case of considerable interest," he remarked,
returning to his natural manner. "I fancy that this grey house on
the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a
word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done
that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab,
and I shall be with you presently."

It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove
back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he
had picked up in the wood.

"This may interest you, Lestrade," he remarked, holding it out.
"The murder was done with it."

"I see no marks."

"There are none."

"How do you know, then?"

"The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few
days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It
corresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other
weapon."

"And the murderer?"

"Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears
thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian
cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his
pocket. There are several other indications, but these may be
enough to aid us in our search."

Lestrade laughed. "I am afraid that I am still a sceptic," he
said. "Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a
hard-headed British jury."

"Nous verrons," answered Holmes calmly. "You work your own
method, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon,
and shall probably return to London by the evening train."

"And leave your case unfinished?"

"No, finished."

"But the mystery?"

"It is solved."

"Who was the criminal, then?"

"The gentleman I describe."

"But who is he?"

"Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a
populous neighbourhood."

Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am a practical man," he said,
"and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking
for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the
laughing-stock of Scotland Yard."

"All right," said Holmes quietly. "I have given you the chance.
Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before
I leave."

Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where
we found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in
thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds
himself in a perplexing position.

"Look here, Watson," he said when the cloth was cleared "just sit
down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don't
know quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a
cigar and let me expound."

 "Pray do so."

"Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about
young McCarthy's narrative which struck us both instantly,
although they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One
was the fact that his father should, according to his account,
cry 'Cooee!' before seeing him. The other was his singular dying
reference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but
that was all that caught the son's ear. Now from this double
point our research must commence, and we will begin it by
presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true."

"What of this 'Cooee!' then?"

"Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The
son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that
he was within earshot. The 'Cooee!' was meant to attract the
attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But
'Cooee' is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used
between Australians. There is a strong presumption that the
person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was
someone who had been in Australia."

"What of the rat, then?"

Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened
it out on the table. "This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,"
he said. "I wired to Bristol for it last night." He put his hand
over part of the map. "What do you read?"

"ARAT," I read.

"And now?" He raised his hand.

"BALLARAT."

"Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his
son only caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter
the name of his murderer. So and so, of Ballarat."

"It is wonderful!" I exclaimed.

"It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down
considerably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point
which, granting the son's statement to be correct, was a
certainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite
conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak."

"Certainly."

"And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only
be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could
hardly wander."

"Quite so."

"Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the
ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that
imbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal."

"But how did you gain them?"

"You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of
trifles."

"His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length
of his stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces."

"Yes, they were peculiar boots."

"But his lameness?"

"The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than
his left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped--he
was lame."

"But his left-handedness."

"You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded
by the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from
immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can
that be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind
that tree during the interview between the father and son. He had
even smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special
knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian
cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and
written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different
varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the
ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss
where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety
which are rolled in Rotterdam."

"And the cigar-holder?"

"I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he
used a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the
cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife."

"Holmes," I said, "you have drawn a net round this man from which
he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as
truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the
direction in which all this points. The culprit is--"

"Mr. John Turner," cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of
our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.

The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His
slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of
decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and
his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual
strength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled
hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air
of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an
ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were
tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that
he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.

"Pray sit down on the sofa," said Holmes gently. "You had my
note?"

"Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to
see me here to avoid scandal."

"I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall."

"And why did you wish to see me?" He looked across at my
companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question
was already answered.

"Yes," said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. "It
is so. I know all about McCarthy."

The old man sank his face in his hands. "God help me!" he cried.
"But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you
my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at
the Assizes."

"I am glad to hear you say so," said Holmes gravely.

"I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It
would break her heart--it will break her heart when she hears
that I am arrested."

"It may not come to that," said Holmes.

"What?"

"I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter
who required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests.
Young McCarthy must be got off, however."

"I am a dying man," said old Turner. "I have had diabetes for
years. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a
month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol."

Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand
and a bundle of paper before him. "Just tell us the truth," he
said. "I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson
here can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the
last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall
not use it unless it is absolutely needed."

"It's as well," said the old man; "it's a question whether I
shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I
should wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the
thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but
will not take me long to tell.

"You didn't know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil
incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of
such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years,
and he has blasted my life. I'll tell you first how I came to be
in his power.

"It was in the early '60's at the diggings. I was a young chap
then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at
anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck
with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you
would call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and
we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time
to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings.
Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party
is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.

"One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and
we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers
and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of
their saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed,
however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of
the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the
Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his
wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every
feature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made
our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted
from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and
respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in
the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money,
to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too,
and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice.
Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down
the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned
over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was
going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.

"I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in
Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his
foot.

"'Here we are, Jack,' says he, touching me on the arm; 'we'll be
as good as a family to you. There's two of us, me and my son, and
you can have the keeping of us. If you don't--it's a fine,
law-abiding country is England, and there's always a policeman
within hail.'

"Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking
them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land
ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness;
turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my
elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more
afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he
wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without
question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing
which I could not give. He asked for Alice.

"His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was
known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that
his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was
firm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that
I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that
was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do
his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses
to talk it over.

"When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I
smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone.
But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in
me seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my
daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she
were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I
and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a
man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and
a desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb,
I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl!
Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I
did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned,
I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl
should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more
than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction
than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought
back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I
was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in
my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that
occurred."

"Well, it is not for me to judge you," said Holmes as the old man
signed the statement which had been drawn out. "I pray that we
may never be exposed to such a temptation."

"I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?"

"In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you
will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the
Assizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is
condemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be
seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or
dead, shall be safe with us."

"Farewell, then," said the old man solemnly. "Your own deathbeds,
when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace
which you have given to mine." Tottering and shaking in all his
giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.

"God help us!" said Holmes after a long silence. "Why does fate
play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such
a case as this that I do not think of Baxter's words, and say,
'There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.'"

James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a
number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and
submitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven
months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is
every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily
together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their
past.



ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS

When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes
cases between the years '82 and '90, I am faced by so many which
present strange and interesting features that it is no easy
matter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however,
have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have
not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend
possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of
these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his
analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without
an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and
have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and
surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to
him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable
in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted
to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are
points in connection with it which never have been, and probably
never will be, entirely cleared up.

The year '87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater
or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my
headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the
adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant
Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a
furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the
British barque "Sophy Anderson", of the singular adventures of the
Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the
Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered,
Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man's watch, to
prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that
therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time--a
deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the
case. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of
them present such singular features as the strange train of
circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.

It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales
had set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had
screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that
even here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced
to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and
to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which
shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like
untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew
higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in
the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the
fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the
other was deep in one of Clark Russell's fine sea-stories until
the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text,
and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of
the sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother's, and for a
few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker
Street.

"Why," said I, glancing up at my companion, "that was surely the
bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?"

"Except yourself I have none," he answered. "I do not encourage
visitors."

"A client, then?"

"If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out
on such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more
likely to be some crony of the landlady's."

Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there
came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He
stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and
towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.

"Come in!" said he.

The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the
outside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of
refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella
which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told
of the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about
him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his
face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is
weighed down with some great anxiety.

"I owe you an apology," he said, raising his golden pince-nez to
his eyes. "I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have
brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug
chamber."

"Give me your coat and umbrella," said Holmes. "They may rest
here on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from
the south-west, I see."

"Yes, from Horsham."

"That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is
quite distinctive."

"I have come for advice."

"That is easily got."

"And help."

"That is not always so easy."

"I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast
how you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal."

"Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards."

"He said that you could solve anything."

"He said too much."

"That you are never beaten."

"I have been beaten four times--three times by men, and once by a
woman."

"But what is that compared with the number of your successes?"

"It is true that I have been generally successful."

"Then you may be so with me."

"I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me
with some details as to your case."

"It is no ordinary one."

"None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of
appeal."

"And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you
have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of
events than those which have happened in my own family."

"You fill me with interest," said Holmes. "Pray give us the
essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards
question you as to those details which seem to me to be most
important."

The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out
towards the blaze.

"My name," said he, "is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have,
as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful
business. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an
idea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the
affair.

"You must know that my grandfather had two sons--my uncle Elias
and my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry,
which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He
was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business
met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire
upon a handsome competence.

"My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and
became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done
very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson's army,
and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When
Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where
he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came
back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham.
He had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his
reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his
dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to
them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very
foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring
disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I
doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or
three fields round his house, and there he would take his
exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave
his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very
heavily, but he would see no society and did not want any
friends, not even his own brother.

"He didn't mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the
time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This
would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years
in England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he
was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be
fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would
make me his representative both with the servants and with the
tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite
master of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I
liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in
his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he
had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was
invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or
anyone else to enter. With a boy's curiosity I have peeped
through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a
collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such
a room.

"One day--it was in March, 1883--a letter with a foreign stamp
lay upon the table in front of the colonel's plate. It was not a
common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all
paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. 'From
India!' said he as he took it up, 'Pondicherry postmark! What can
this be?' Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little
dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to
laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight
of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his
skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he
still held in his trembling hand, 'K. K. K.!' he shrieked, and
then, 'My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!'

"'What is it, uncle?' I cried.

"'Death,' said he, and rising from the table he retired to his
room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope
and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the
gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else
save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his
overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I
ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key,
which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small
brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.

"'They may do what they like, but I'll checkmate them still,'
said he with an oath. 'Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my
room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.'

"I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to
step up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the
grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned
paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I
glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was
printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the
envelope.

"'I wish you, John,' said my uncle, 'to witness my will. I leave
my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to
my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to
you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you
cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest
enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can't
say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper
where Mr. Fordham shows you.'

"I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with
him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest
impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every
way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I
could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left
behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed
and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I
could see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever,
and he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his
time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the
inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy
and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a
revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man,
and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by
man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would
rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him,
like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror
which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen
his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it
were new raised from a basin.

"Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to
abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those
drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when
we went to search for him, face downward in a little
green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There
was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep,
so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity,
brought in a verdict of 'suicide.' But I, who knew how he winced
from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself
that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed,
however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and
of some 14,000 pounds, which lay to his credit at the bank."

"One moment," Holmes interposed, "your statement is, I foresee,
one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me
have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and
the date of his supposed suicide."

"The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks
later, upon the night of May 2nd."

"Thank you. Pray proceed."

"When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my
request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been
always locked up. We found the brass box there, although its
contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a
paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and
'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register' written beneath.
These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had
been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was
nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many
scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle's life in
America. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had
done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier.
Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern
states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had
evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag
politicians who had been sent down from the North.

"Well, it was the beginning of '84 when my father came to live at
Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the
January of '85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my
father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the
breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened
envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the
outstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what
he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked
very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon
himself.

"'Why, what on earth does this mean, John?' he stammered.

"My heart had turned to lead. 'It is K. K. K.,' said I.

"He looked inside the envelope. 'So it is,' he cried. 'Here are
the very letters. But what is this written above them?'

"'Put the papers on the sundial,' I read, peeping over his
shoulder.

"'What papers? What sundial?' he asked.

"'The sundial in the garden. There is no other,' said I; 'but the
papers must be those that are destroyed.'

"'Pooh!' said he, gripping hard at his courage. 'We are in a
civilised land here, and we can't have tomfoolery of this kind.
Where does the thing come from?'

"'From Dundee,' I answered, glancing at the postmark.

"'Some preposterous practical joke,' said he. 'What have I to do
with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such
nonsense.'

"'I should certainly speak to the police,' I said.

"'And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.'

"'Then let me do so?'

"'No, I forbid you. I won't have a fuss made about such
nonsense.'

"It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate
man. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of
forebodings.

"On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went
from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is
in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad
that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from
danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in
error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram
from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had
fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the
neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I
hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered
his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from
Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him,
and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in
bringing in a verdict of 'death from accidental causes.'
Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I
was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of
murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no
robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads.
And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease,
and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been
woven round him.

"In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me
why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well
convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an
incident in my uncle's life, and that the danger would be as
pressing in one house as in another.

"It was in January, '85, that my poor father met his end, and two
years and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time
I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that
this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended
with the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon,
however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in
which it had come upon my father."

The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and
turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried
orange pips.

"This is the envelope," he continued. "The postmark is
London--eastern division. Within are the very words which were
upon my father's last message: 'K. K. K.'; and then 'Put the
papers on the sundial.'"

"What have you done?" asked Holmes.

"Nothing."

"Nothing?"

"To tell the truth"--he sank his face into his thin, white
hands--"I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor
rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in
the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight
and no precautions can guard against."

"Tut! tut!" cried Sherlock Holmes. "You must act, man, or you are
lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for
despair."

"I have seen the police."

"Ah!"

"But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that
the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all
practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really
accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with
the warnings."

Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. "Incredible
imbecility!" he cried.

"They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in
the house with me."

"Has he come with you to-night?"

"No. His orders were to stay in the house."

Again Holmes raved in the air.

"Why did you come to me," he cried, "and, above all, why did you
not come at once?"

"I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major
Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to
you."

"It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have
acted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than
that which you have placed before us--no suggestive detail which
might help us?"

"There is one thing," said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat
pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted
paper, he laid it out upon the table. "I have some remembrance,"
said he, "that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I
observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the
ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet
upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it
may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from
among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond
the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think
myself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is
undoubtedly my uncle's."

Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper,
which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from
a book. It was headed, "March, 1869," and beneath were the
following enigmatical notices:

"4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.

"7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and
      John Swain, of St. Augustine.

"9th. McCauley cleared.

"10th. John Swain cleared.

"12th. Visited Paramore. All well."

"Thank you!" said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it
to our visitor. "And now you must on no account lose another
instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told
me. You must get home instantly and act."

"What shall I do?"

"There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must
put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass
box which you have described. You must also put in a note to say
that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that
this is the only one which remains. You must assert that in such
words as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you
must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do
you understand?"

"Entirely."

"Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I
think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our
web to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first
consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens
you. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the
guilty parties."

"I thank you," said the young man, rising and pulling on his
overcoat. "You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall
certainly do as you advise."

"Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in
the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that
you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you
go back?"

"By train from Waterloo."

"It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that
you may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too
closely."

"I am armed."

"That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case."

"I shall see you at Horsham, then?"

"No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek
it."

"Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news
as to the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every
particular." He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside
the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered
against the windows. This strange, wild story seemed to have come
to us from amid the mad elements--blown in upon us like a sheet
of sea-weed in a gale--and now to have been reabsorbed by them
once more.

Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk
forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he
lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue
smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.

"I think, Watson," he remarked at last, "that of all our cases we
have had none more fantastic than this."

"Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four."

"Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems
to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the
Sholtos."

"But have you," I asked, "formed any definite conception as to
what these perils are?"

"There can be no question as to their nature," he answered.

"Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue
this unhappy family?"

Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the
arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. "The ideal
reasoner," he remarked, "would, when he had once been shown a
single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the
chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which
would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole
animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who
has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents
should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both
before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the
reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study
which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the
aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest
pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to
utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this
in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all
knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and
encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so
impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge
which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have
endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one
occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits
in a very precise fashion."

"Yes," I answered, laughing. "It was a singular document.
Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I
remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the
mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry
eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime
records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and
self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the
main points of my analysis."

Holmes grinned at the last item. "Well," he said, "I say now, as
I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic
stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the
rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he
can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which
has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster
all our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the
'American Encyclopaedia' which stands upon the shelf beside you.
Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be
deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong
presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for
leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their
habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for
the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love
of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of
someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis
that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from
America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by
considering the formidable letters which were received by himself
and his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those
letters?"

"The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the
third from London."

"From East London. What do you deduce from that?"

"They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship."

"Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that
the probability--the strong probability--is that the writer was
on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the
case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and
its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days.
Does that suggest anything?"

"A greater distance to travel."

"But the letter had also a greater distance to come."

"Then I do not see the point."

"There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man
or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send
their singular warning or token before them when starting upon
their mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign
when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a
steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter.
But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those
seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which
brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the
writer."

"It is possible."

"More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly
urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to
caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which
it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one
comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay."

"Good God!" I cried. "What can it mean, this relentless
persecution?"

"The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital
importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think
that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them.
A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way
as to deceive a coroner's jury. There must have been several in
it, and they must have been men of resource and determination.
Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may.
In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an
individual and becomes the badge of a society."

"But of what society?"

"Have you never--" said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and
sinking his voice--"have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?"

"I never have."

Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. "Here it
is," said he presently:

"'Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to
the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret
society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the
Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local
branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee,
Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was
used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of
the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country
of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually
preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic
but generally recognised shape--a sprig of oak-leaves in some
parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this
the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might
fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would
unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and
unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the
society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a
case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with
impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the
perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite
of the efforts of the United States government and of the better
classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year
1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have
been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.'

"You will observe," said Holmes, laying down the volume, "that
the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the
disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may
well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his
family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track.
You can understand that this register and diary may implicate
some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many
who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered."

"Then the page we have seen--"

"Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, 'sent
the pips to A, B, and C'--that is, sent the society's warning to
them. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or
left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a
sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let
some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only
chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have
told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done
to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for
half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable
ways of our fellow-men."


It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a
subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the
great city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came
down.

"You will excuse me for not waiting for you," said he; "I have, I
foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of
young Openshaw's."

"What steps will you take?" I asked.

"It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries.
I may have to go down to Horsham, after all."

"You will not go there first?"

"No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the
maid will bring up your coffee."

As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and
glanced my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a
chill to my heart.

"Holmes," I cried, "you are too late."

"Ah!" said he, laying down his cup, "I feared as much. How was it
done?" He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.

"My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading 'Tragedy
Near Waterloo Bridge.' Here is the account:

"Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H
Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and
a splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and
stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it
was quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was
given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was
eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman
whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his
pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham.
It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch
the last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and
the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge
of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body
exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that
the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident,
which should have the effect of calling the attention of the
authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages."

We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and
shaken than I had ever seen him.

"That hurts my pride, Watson," he said at last. "It is a petty
feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal
matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my
hand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that
I should send him away to his death--!" He sprang from his chair
and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a
flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and
unclasping of his long thin hands.

"They must be cunning devils," he exclaimed at last. "How could
they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the
direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too
crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson,
we shall see who will win in the long run. I am going out now!"

"To the police?"

"No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may
take the flies, but not before."

All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in
the evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes
had not come back yet. It was nearly ten o'clock before he
entered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard,
and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously,
washing it down with a long draught of water.

"You are hungry," I remarked.

"Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since
breakfast."

"Nothing?"

"Not a bite. I had no time to think of it."

"And how have you succeeded?"

"Well."

"You have a clue?"

"I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not
long remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish
trade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!"

"What do you mean?"

He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he
squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and
thrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote
"S. H. for J. O." Then he sealed it and addressed it to "Captain
James Calhoun, Barque 'Lone Star,' Savannah, Georgia."

"That will await him when he enters port," said he, chuckling.
"It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a
precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him."

"And who is this Captain Calhoun?"

"The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first."

"How did you trace it, then?"

He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with
dates and names.

"I have spent the whole day," said he, "over Lloyd's registers
and files of the old papers, following the future career of every
vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in
'83. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were
reported there during those months. Of these, one, the 'Lone Star,'
instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported
as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to
one of the states of the Union."

"Texas, I think."

"I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must
have an American origin."

"What then?"

"I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque
'Lone Star' was there in January, '85, my suspicion became a
certainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present
in the port of London."

"Yes?"

"The 'Lone Star' had arrived here last week. I went down to the
Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by
the early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired
to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and
as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the
Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight."

"What will you do, then?"

"Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I
learn, the only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are
Finns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away
from the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has
been loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship
reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and
the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these
three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder."

There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans,
and the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the
orange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as
resolute as themselves, was upon their track. Very long and very
severe were the equinoctial gales that year. We waited long for
news of the "Lone Star" of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We
did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a
shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough
of a wave, with the letters "L. S." carved upon it, and that is
all which we shall ever know of the fate of the "Lone Star."



ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP

Isa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal
of the Theological College of St. George's, was much addicted to
opium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some
foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De
Quincey's description of his dreams and sensations, he had
drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the
same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the
practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many
years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of
mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see
him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point
pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble
man.

One night--it was in June, '89--there came a ring to my bell,
about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the
clock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work
down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.

"A patient!" said she. "You'll have to go out."

I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.

We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps
upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in
some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.

"You will excuse my calling so late," she began, and then,
suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms
about my wife's neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. "Oh, I'm in
such trouble!" she cried; "I do so want a little help."

"Why," said my wife, pulling up her veil, "it is Kate Whitney.
How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when
you came in."

"I didn't know what to do, so I came straight to you." That was
always the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds
to a light-house.

"It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine
and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or
should you rather that I sent James off to bed?"

"Oh, no, no! I want the doctor's advice and help, too. It's about
Isa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about
him!"

It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her
husband's trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend
and school companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words
as we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it
possible that we could bring him back to her?

It seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late
he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the
farthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been
confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and
shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him
eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the
dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the
effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar
of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could
she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and
pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?

There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of
it. Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second
thought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney's medical
adviser, and as such I had influence over him. I could manage it
better if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would
send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the
address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left
my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding
eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at
the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to
be.

But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my
adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the
high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east
of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached
by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the
mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search.
Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in
the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the
light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch
and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the
brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the
forecastle of an emigrant ship.

Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying
in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads
thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a
dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black
shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright,
now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of
the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to
themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low,
monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then
suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own
thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At
the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside
which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old
man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon
his knees, staring into the fire.

As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe
for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.

"Thank you. I have not come to stay," said I. "There is a friend
of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him."

There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and
peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and
unkempt, staring out at me.

"My God! It's Watson," said he. He was in a pitiable state of
reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. "I say, Watson, what
o'clock is it?"

"Nearly eleven."

"Of what day?"

"Of Friday, June 19th."

"Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What
d'you want to frighten a chap for?" He sank his face onto his
arms and began to sob in a high treble key.

"I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting
this two days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!"

"So I am. But you've got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here
a few hours, three pipes, four pipes--I forget how many. But I'll
go home with you. I wouldn't frighten Kate--poor little Kate.
Give me your hand! Have you a cab?"

"Yes, I have one waiting."

"Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I
owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself."

I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of
sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying
fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed
the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my
skirt, and a low voice whispered, "Walk past me, and then look
back at me." The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I
glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my
side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very
wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between
his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his
fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all my
self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of
astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him
but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull
eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and
grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He
made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he
turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided
into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.

"Holmes!" I whispered, "what on earth are you doing in this den?"

"As low as you can," he answered; "I have excellent ears. If you
would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend
of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with
you."

"I have a cab outside."

"Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he
appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should
recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to
say that you have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait
outside, I shall be with you in five minutes."

It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes' requests, for
they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with
such a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney
was once confined in the cab my mission was practically
accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better
than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular
adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a
few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney's bill, led him
out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a
very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den,
and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two
streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot.
Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and
burst into a hearty fit of laughter.

"I suppose, Watson," said he, "that you imagine that I have added
opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little
weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical
views."

"I was certainly surprised to find you there."

"But not more so than I to find you."

"I came to find a friend."

"And I to find an enemy."

"An enemy?"

"Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural
prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable
inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent
ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been
recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an
hour's purchase; for I have used it before now for my own
purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have
vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that
building, near the corner of Paul's Wharf, which could tell some
strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless
nights."

"What! You do not mean bodies?"

"Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had 1000 pounds
for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It
is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that
Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our
trap should be here." He put his two forefingers between his
teeth and whistled shrilly--a signal which was answered by a
similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle
of wheels and the clink of horses' hoofs.

"Now, Watson," said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through
the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from
its side lanterns. "You'll come with me, won't you?"

"If I can be of use."

"Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still
more so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one."

"The Cedars?"

"Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair's house. I am staying there while I
conduct the inquiry."

"Where is it, then?"

"Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us."

"But I am all in the dark."

"Of course you are. You'll know all about it presently. Jump up
here. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here's half a
crown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her
head. So long, then!"

He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through
the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which
widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad
balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly
beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and
mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of
the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of
revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a
star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of
the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his
breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat
beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which
seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in
upon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several miles,
and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban
villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up
his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he
is acting for the best.

"You have a grand gift of silence, Watson," said he. "It makes
you quite invaluable as a companion. 'Pon my word, it is a great
thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are
not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear
little woman to-night when she meets me at the door."

"You forget that I know nothing about it."

"I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before
we get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can
get nothing to go upon. There's plenty of thread, no doubt, but I
can't get the end of it into my hand. Now, I'll state the case
clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a
spark where all is dark to me."

"Proceed, then."

"Some years ago--to be definite, in May, 1884--there came to Lee
a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have
plenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very
nicely, and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made
friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter
of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no
occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into
town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon
Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of
age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very
affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know
him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far
as we have been able to ascertain, amount to 88 pounds 10s., while
he has 220 pounds standing to his credit in the Capital and
Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that money
troubles have been weighing upon his mind.

"Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier
than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important
commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy
home a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife
received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his
departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable
value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the
offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up
in your London, you will know that the office of the company is
in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where
you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for
the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company's office,
got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through
Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me
so far?"

"It is very clear."

"If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St.
Clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab,
as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself.
While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly
heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her
husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning
to her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she
distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly
agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then
vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that
he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind.
One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that
although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town
in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.

"Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the
steps--for the house was none other than the opium den in which
you found me to-night--and running through the front room she
attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At
the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of
whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who
acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled
with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the
lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of
constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The
inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the
continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to
the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no
sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was
no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who,
it seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly
swore that no one else had been in the front room during the
afternoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was
staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had
been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box
which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell
a cascade of children's bricks. It was the toy which he had
promised to bring home.

"This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple
showed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious.
The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an
abominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a
sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon
the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom
window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered
at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The
bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On
examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill,
and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of
the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were
all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of
his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch--all were
there. There were no signs of violence upon any of these
garments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St.
Clair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no
other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon
the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by
swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of
the tragedy.

"And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately
implicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the
vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair's story, he was
known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few
seconds of her husband's appearance at the window, he could
hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence
was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no
knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he
could not account in any way for the presence of the missing
gentleman's clothes.

"So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who
lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was
certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St.
Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which
is familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a
professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police
regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some
little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand
side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the
wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,
cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he
is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the
greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I
have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of
making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised
at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His
appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him
without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face
disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has
turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a
pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular
contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid
the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he
is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be
thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now
learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been
the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest."

"But a cripple!" said I. "What could he have done single-handed
against a man in the prime of life?"

"He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in
other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man.
Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that
weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional
strength in the others."

"Pray continue your narrative."

"Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the
window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her
presence could be of no help to them in their investigations.
Inspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful
examination of the premises, but without finding anything which
threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in not
arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes
during which he might have communicated with his friend the
Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and
searched, without anything being found which could incriminate
him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right
shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been
cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from
there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and
that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from
the same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr.
Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in
his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to
Mrs. St. Clair's assertion that she had actually seen her husband
at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or
dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the
police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in
the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.

"And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they
had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair's coat, and not
Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And
what do you think they found in the pockets?"

"I cannot imagine."

"No, I don't think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with
pennies and half-pennies--421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It
was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a
human body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between
the wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the
weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked
away into the river."

"But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the
room. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?"

"No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose
that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the
window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed.
What would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him
that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize
the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it
would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little
time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried
to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his
Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.
There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret
hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he
stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the
pockets to make sure of the coat's sinking. He throws it out, and
would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard
the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the
window when the police appeared."

"It certainly sounds feasible."

"Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a
better. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the
station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before
been anything against him. He had for years been known as a
professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very
quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and
the questions which have to be solved--what Neville St. Clair was
doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is
he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance--are
all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot
recall any case within my experience which looked at the first
glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties."

While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of
events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great
town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and
we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us.
Just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered
villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.

"We are on the outskirts of Lee," said my companion. "We have
touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in
Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent.
See that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside
that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have
little doubt, caught the clink of our horse's feet."

"But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?" I
asked.

"Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here.
Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and
you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for
my friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have
no news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!"

We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its
own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse's head, and
springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding
gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door
flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad
in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy
pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure
outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one
half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head
and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing
question.

"Well?" she cried, "well?" And then, seeing that there were two
of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw
that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.

"No good news?"

"None."

"No bad?"

"No."

"Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have
had a long day."

"This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to
me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it
possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this
investigation."

"I am delighted to see you," said she, pressing my hand warmly.
"You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our
arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so
suddenly upon us."

"My dear madam," said I, "I am an old campaigner, and if I were
not I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of
any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be
indeed happy."

"Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said the lady as we entered a
well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had
been laid out, "I should very much like to ask you one or two
plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain
answer."

"Certainly, madam."

"Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given
to fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion."

"Upon what point?"

"In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?"

Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question.
"Frankly, now!" she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking
keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.

"Frankly, then, madam, I do not."

"You think that he is dead?"

"I do."

"Murdered?"

"I don't say that. Perhaps."

"And on what day did he meet his death?"

"On Monday."

"Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how
it is that I have received a letter from him to-day."

Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been
galvanised.

"What!" he roared.

"Yes, to-day." She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of
paper in the air.

"May I see it?"

"Certainly."

He snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out
upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I
had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The
envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend
postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day
before, for it was considerably after midnight.

"Coarse writing," murmured Holmes. "Surely this is not your
husband's writing, madam."

"No, but the enclosure is."

"I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go
and inquire as to the address."

"How can you tell that?"

"The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried
itself. The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that
blotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight
off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. This
man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before
he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not
familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is
nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha!
there has been an enclosure here!"

"Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring."

"And you are sure that this is your husband's hand?"

"One of his hands."

"One?"

"His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual
writing, and yet I know it well."

"'Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a
huge error which it may take some little time to rectify.
Wait in patience.--NEVILLE.' Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf
of a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in
Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been
gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been
chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your husband's
hand, madam?"

"None. Neville wrote those words."

"And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair,
the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the
danger is over."

"But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes."

"Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent.
The ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from
him."

"No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!"

"Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only
posted to-day."

"That is possible."

"If so, much may have happened between."

"Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is
well with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I
should know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him
last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room
rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that
something had happened. Do you think that I would respond to such
a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?"

"I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman
may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical
reasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very strong
piece of evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband
is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away
from you?"

"I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable."

"And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?"

"No."

"And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?"

"Very much so."

"Was the window open?"

"Yes."

"Then he might have called to you?"

"He might."

"He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?"

"Yes."

"A call for help, you thought?"

"Yes. He waved his hands."

"But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the
unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?"

"It is possible."

"And you thought he was pulled back?"

"He disappeared so suddenly."

"He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the
room?"

"No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and
the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs."

"Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his
ordinary clothes on?"

"But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare
throat."

"Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?"

"Never."

"Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?"

"Never."

"Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about
which I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little
supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day
to-morrow."

A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our
disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary
after my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however,
who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for
days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over,
rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view
until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his
data were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now
preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and
waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered
about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from
the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of
Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with
an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front
of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an
old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the
corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him,
silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set
aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he
sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found
the summer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe was still
between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was
full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of
shag which I had seen upon the previous night.

"Awake, Watson?" he asked.

"Yes."

"Game for a morning drive?"

"Certainly."

"Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the
stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out." He
chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed
a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.

As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one
was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly
finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was
putting in the horse.

"I want to test a little theory of mine," said he, pulling on his
boots. "I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the
presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve
to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the
key of the affair now."

"And where is it?" I asked, smiling.

"In the bathroom," he answered. "Oh, yes, I am not joking," he
continued, seeing my look of incredulity. "I have just been
there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this
Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will
not fit the lock."

We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into
the bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and
trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both
sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country
carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but
the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as
some city in a dream.

"It has been in some points a singular case," said Holmes,
flicking the horse on into a gallop. "I confess that I have been
as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than
never to learn it at all."

In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily
from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey
side. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the
river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the
right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well
known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted
him. One of them held the horse's head while the other led us in.

"Who is on duty?" asked Holmes.

"Inspector Bradstreet, sir."

"Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?" A tall, stout official had come
down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged
jacket. "I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet."
"Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here." It was a small,
office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a
telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his
desk.

"What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?"

"I called about that beggarman, Boone--the one who was charged
with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St.
Clair, of Lee."

"Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries."

"So I heard. You have him here?"

"In the cells."

"Is he quiet?"

"Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel."

"Dirty?"

"Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his
face is as black as a tinker's. Well, when once his case has been
settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you
saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it."

"I should like to see him very much."

"Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave
your bag."

"No, I think that I'll take it."

"Very good. Come this way, if you please." He led us down a
passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and
brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each
side.

"The third on the right is his," said the inspector. "Here it
is!" He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door
and glanced through.

"He is asleep," said he. "You can see him very well."

We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his
face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and
heavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his
calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his
tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely
dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its
repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right
across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up
one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a
perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over
his eyes and forehead.

"He's a beauty, isn't he?" said the inspector.

"He certainly needs a wash," remarked Holmes. "I had an idea that
he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me."
He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my
astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.

"He! he! You are a funny one," chuckled the inspector.

"Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very
quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable
figure."

"Well, I don't know why not," said the inspector. "He doesn't
look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?" He slipped his
key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The
sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep
slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge,
and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the
prisoner's face.

"Let me introduce you," he shouted, "to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of
Lee, in the county of Kent."

Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The man's face peeled
off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the
coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had
seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the
repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled
red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale,
sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned,
rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment.
Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and
threw himself down with his face to the pillow.

"Great heavens!" cried the inspector, "it is, indeed, the missing
man. I know him from the photograph."

The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons
himself to his destiny. "Be it so," said he. "And pray what am I
charged with?"

"With making away with Mr. Neville St.-- Oh, come, you can't be
charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of
it," said the inspector with a grin. "Well, I have been
twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake."

"If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime
has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally
detained."

"No crime, but a very great error has been committed," said
Holmes. "You would have done better to have trusted you wife."

"It was not the wife; it was the children," groaned the prisoner.
"God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My
God! What an exposure! What can I do?"

Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him
kindly on the shoulder.

"If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up," said
he, "of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand,
if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible
case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the
details should find their way into the papers. Inspector
Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you
might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case
would then never go into court at all."

"God bless you!" cried the prisoner passionately. "I would have
endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left
my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.

"You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a
schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent
education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and
finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day
my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the
metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point
from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying
begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to
base my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the
secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for
my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I painted my
face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good
scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a
small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of
hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business
part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a
beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned
home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no
less than 26s. 4d.

"I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until,
some time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ
served upon me for 25 pounds. I was at my wit's end where to get
the money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight's
grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers,
and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In
ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.

"Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous
work at 2 pounds a week when I knew that I could earn as much in
a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on
the ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my
pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up
reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first
chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets
with coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a
low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could
every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings
transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow,
a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that
my secret was safe in his possession.

"Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of
money. I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London
could earn 700 pounds a year--which is less than my average
takings--but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making
up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by
practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City.
All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me,
and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take 2 pounds.

"As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the
country, and eventually married, without anyone having a
suspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had
business in the City. She little knew what.

"Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my
room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw,
to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the
street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of
surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my
confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from
coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that
she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on
those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife's
eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it
occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that
the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening
by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in
the bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was
weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from
the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of
the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes
would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of
constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather,
I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr.
Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.

"I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I
was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and
hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would
be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the
Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together
with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to
fear."

"That note only reached her yesterday," said Holmes.

"Good God! What a week she must have spent!"

"The police have watched this Lascar," said Inspector Bradstreet,
"and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to
post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor
customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days."

"That was it," said Holmes, nodding approvingly; "I have no doubt
of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?"

"Many times; but what was a fine to me?"

"It must stop here, however," said Bradstreet. "If the police are
to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone."

"I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take."

"In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps
may be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out.
I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for
having cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your
results."

"I reached this one," said my friend, "by sitting upon five
pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if
we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast."



VII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE

I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second
morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the
compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a
purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the
right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly
studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and
on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable
hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several
places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair
suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the
purpose of examination.

"You are engaged," said I; "perhaps I interrupt you."

"Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss
my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one"--he jerked his
thumb in the direction of the old hat--"but there are points in
connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and
even of instruction."

I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his
crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows
were thick with the ice crystals. "I suppose," I remarked, "that,
homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to
it--that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of
some mystery and the punishment of some crime."

"No, no. No crime," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "Only one of
those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have
four million human beings all jostling each other within the
space of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so
dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events
may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be
presented which may be striking and bizarre without being
criminal. We have already had experience of such."

"So much so," I remarked, "that of the last six cases which I
have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any
legal crime."

"Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler
papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the
adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt
that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category.
You know Peterson, the commissionaire?"

"Yes."

"It is to him that this trophy belongs."

"It is his hat."

"No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will
look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual
problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon
Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I
have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson's
fire. The facts are these: about four o'clock on Christmas
morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was
returning from some small jollification and was making his way
homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in
the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and
carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the
corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger
and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the
man's hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and,
swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him.
Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his
assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and
seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him,
dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the
labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham
Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of
Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of
battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this
battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose."

"Which surely he restored to their owner?"

"My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that 'For
Mrs. Henry Baker' was printed upon a small card which was tied to
the bird's left leg, and it is also true that the initials 'H.
B.' are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are
some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in
this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any
one of them."

"What, then, did Peterson do?"

"He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning,
knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me.
The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs
that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it
should be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried
it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose,
while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who
lost his Christmas dinner."

"Did he not advertise?"

"No."

"Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?"

"Only as much as we can deduce."

"From his hat?"

"Precisely."

"But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered
felt?"

"Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather
yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this
article?"

I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather
ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round
shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of
red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker's
name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials "H. B." were
scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a
hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was
cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places,
although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the
discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.

"I can see nothing," said I, handing it back to my friend.

"On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail,
however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in
drawing your inferences."

"Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?"

He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective
fashion which was characteristic of him. "It is perhaps less
suggestive than it might have been," he remarked, "and yet there
are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others
which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That
the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the
face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the
last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He
had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a
moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his
fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink,
at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that
his wife has ceased to love him."

"My dear Holmes!"

"He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect," he
continued, disregarding my remonstrance. "He is a man who leads a
sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is
middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the
last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are
the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also,
by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid
on in his house."

"You are certainly joking, Holmes."

"Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you
these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?"

"I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I
am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that
this man was intellectual?"

For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right
over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. "It is
a question of cubic capacity," said he; "a man with so large a
brain must have something in it."

"The decline of his fortunes, then?"

"This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge
came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the
band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could
afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no
hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world."

"Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the
foresight and the moral retrogression?"

Sherlock Holmes laughed. "Here is the foresight," said he putting
his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer.
"They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a
sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his
way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see
that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace
it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly,
which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other
hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the
felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not
entirely lost his self-respect."

"Your reasoning is certainly plausible."

"The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is
grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses
lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the
lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of
hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all
appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of
lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey
dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house,
showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while
the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the
wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in
the best of training."

"But his wife--you said that she had ceased to love him."

"This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear
Watson, with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat, and
when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear
that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's
affection."

"But he might be a bachelor."

"Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his
wife. Remember the card upon the bird's leg."

"You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce
that the gas is not laid on in his house?"

"One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I
see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt
that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with
burning tallow--walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in
one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never
got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?"

"Well, it is very ingenious," said I, laughing; "but since, as
you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm
done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a
waste of energy."

Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew
open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment
with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with
astonishment.

"The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!" he gasped.

"Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off
through the kitchen window?" Holmes twisted himself round upon
the sofa to get a fairer view of the man's excited face.

"See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!" He held out
his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly
scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but
of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric
point in the dark hollow of his hand.

Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. "By Jove, Peterson!" said
he, "this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you
have got?"

"A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though
it were putty."

"It's more than a precious stone. It is the precious stone."

"Not the Countess of Morcar's blue carbuncle!" I ejaculated.

"Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I
have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day
lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be
conjectured, but the reward offered of 1000 pounds is certainly
not within a twentieth part of the market price."

"A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!" The commissionaire
plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.

"That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are
sentimental considerations in the background which would induce
the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but
recover the gem."

"It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan," I
remarked.

"Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner,
a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady's
jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case
has been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the
matter here, I believe." He rummaged amid his newspapers,
glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out,
doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:

"Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was
brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst.,
abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the
valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder,
upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect
that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess
of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might
solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had
remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been
called away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared,
that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco
casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was
accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the
dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was
arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found
either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to
the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder's cry of dismay on
discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room,
where she found matters as described by the last witness.
Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest
of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence
in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for
robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate
refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to
the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion
during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was
carried out of court."

"Hum! So much for the police-court," said Holmes thoughtfully,
tossing aside the paper. "The question for us now to solve is the
sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to
the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You
see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much
more important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the
stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry
Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other
characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set
ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and
ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To
do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie
undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If
this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods."

"What will you say?"

"Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: 'Found at
the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr.
Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at
221B, Baker Street.' That is clear and concise."

"Very. But will he see it?"

"Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor
man, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his
mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson
that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must
have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his
bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to
see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to
it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency
and have this put in the evening papers."

"In which, sir?"

"Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James's, Evening News,
Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you."

"Very well, sir. And this stone?"

"Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say,
Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here
with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place
of the one which your family is now devouring."

When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and
held it against the light. "It's a bonny thing," said he. "Just
see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and
focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil's pet
baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a
bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found
in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable
in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is
blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has
already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a
vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about
for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal.
Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the
gallows and the prison? I'll lock it up in my strong box now and
drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it."

"Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?"

"I cannot tell."

"Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had
anything to do with the matter?"

"It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an
absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he
was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made
of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple
test if we have an answer to our advertisement."

"And you can do nothing until then?"

"Nothing."

"In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall
come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I
should like to see the solution of so tangled a business."

"Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I
believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I
ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop."

I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past
six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I
approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a
coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the
bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I
arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to
Holmes' room.

"Mr. Henry Baker, I believe," said he, rising from his armchair
and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he
could so readily assume. "Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr.
Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is
more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have
just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?"

"Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat."

He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a
broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of
grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight
tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes' surmise as to his
habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in
front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded
from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a
slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the
impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had
ill-usage at the hands of fortune.

"We have retained these things for some days," said Holmes,
"because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your
address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise."

Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. "Shillings have not
been so plentiful with me as they once were," he remarked. "I had
no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off
both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a
hopeless attempt at recovering them."

"Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to
eat it."

"To eat it!" Our visitor half rose from his chair in his
excitement.

"Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so.
But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is
about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your
purpose equally well?"

"Oh, certainly, certainly," answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of
relief.

"Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of
your own bird, so if you wish--"

The man burst into a hearty laugh. "They might be useful to me as
relics of my adventure," said he, "but beyond that I can hardly
see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are
going to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I
will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive
upon the sideboard."

Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug
of his shoulders.

"There is your hat, then, and there your bird," said he. "By the
way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one
from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a
better grown goose."

"Certainly, sir," said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly
gained property under his arm. "There are a few of us who
frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum--we are to be found in
the Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our
good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which,
on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to
receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the
rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a
Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity." With
a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and
strode off upon his way.

"So much for Mr. Henry Baker," said Holmes when he had closed the
door behind him. "It is quite certain that he knows nothing
whatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?"

"Not particularly."

"Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow
up this clue while it is still hot."

"By all means."

It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped
cravats about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly
in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out
into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out
crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors' quarter,
Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into
Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at
the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one
of the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open
the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from
the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.

"Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,"
said he.

"My geese!" The man seemed surprised.

"Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker,
who was a member of your goose club."

"Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them's not our geese."

"Indeed! Whose, then?"

"Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden."

"Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?"

"Breckinridge is his name."

"Ah! I don't know him. Well, here's your good health landlord,
and prosperity to your house. Good-night."

"Now for Mr. Breckinridge," he continued, buttoning up his coat
as we came out into the frosty air. "Remember, Watson that though
we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we
have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years' penal
servitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible
that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we
have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police,
and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us
follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and
quick march!"

We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a
zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest
stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor
a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was
helping a boy to put up the shutters.

"Good-evening. It's a cold night," said Holmes.

The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my
companion.

"Sold out of geese, I see," continued Holmes, pointing at the
bare slabs of marble.

"Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning."

"That's no good."

"Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare."

"Ah, but I was recommended to you."

"Who by?"

"The landlord of the Alpha."

"Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen."

"Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?"

To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the
salesman.

"Now, then, mister," said he, with his head cocked and his arms
akimbo, "what are you driving at? Let's have it straight, now."

"It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the
geese which you supplied to the Alpha."

"Well then, I shan't tell you. So now!"

"Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don't know why you
should be so warm over such a trifle."

"Warm! You'd be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am.
When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end
of the business; but it's 'Where are the geese?' and 'Who did you
sell the geese to?' and 'What will you take for the geese?' One
would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the
fuss that is made over them."

"Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been
making inquiries," said Holmes carelessly. "If you won't tell us
the bet is off, that is all. But I'm always ready to back my
opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the
bird I ate is country bred."

"Well, then, you've lost your fiver, for it's town bred," snapped
the salesman.

"It's nothing of the kind."

"I say it is."

"I don't believe it."

"D'you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled
them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that
went to the Alpha were town bred."

"You'll never persuade me to believe that."

"Will you bet, then?"

"It's merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But
I'll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be
obstinate."

The salesman chuckled grimly. "Bring me the books, Bill," said
he.

The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great
greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging
lamp.

"Now then, Mr. Cocksure," said the salesman, "I thought that I
was out of geese, but before I finish you'll find that there is
still one left in my shop. You see this little book?"

"Well?"

"That's the list of the folk from whom I buy. D'you see? Well,
then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers
after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger.
Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a
list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just
read it out to me."

"Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road--249," read Holmes.

"Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger."

Holmes turned to the page indicated. "Here you are, 'Mrs.
Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.'"

"Now, then, what's the last entry?"

"'December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.'"

"Quite so. There you are. And underneath?"

"'Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.'"

"What have you to say now?"

Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from
his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the
air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off
he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless
fashion which was peculiar to him.

"When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the 'Pink 'un'
protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,"
said he. "I daresay that if I had put 100 pounds down in front of
him, that man would not have given me such complete information
as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a
wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our
quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is
whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or
whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what
that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves
who are anxious about the matter, and I should--"

His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke
out from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a
little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of
yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while
Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was
shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.

"I've had enough of you and your geese," he shouted. "I wish you
were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more
with your silly talk I'll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs.
Oakshott here and I'll answer her, but what have you to do with
it? Did I buy the geese off you?"

"No; but one of them was mine all the same," whined the little
man.

"Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it."

"She told me to ask you."

"Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I've had
enough of it. Get out of this!" He rushed fiercely forward, and
the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.

"Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road," whispered Holmes.
"Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this
fellow." Striding through the scattered knots of people who
lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook
the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang
round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of
colour had been driven from his face.

"Who are you, then? What do you want?" he asked in a quavering
voice.

"You will excuse me," said Holmes blandly, "but I could not help
overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now.
I think that I could be of assistance to you."

"You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?"

"My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other
people don't know."

"But you can know nothing of this?"

"Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to
trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton
Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr.
Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr.
Henry Baker is a member."

"Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet," cried
the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers.
"I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter."

Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. "In that
case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this
wind-swept market-place," said he. "But pray tell me, before we
go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting."

The man hesitated for an instant. "My name is John Robinson," he
answered with a sidelong glance.

"No, no; the real name," said Holmes sweetly. "It is always
awkward doing business with an alias."

A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. "Well then,"
said he, "my real name is James Ryder."

"Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray
step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you
everything which you would wish to know."

The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with
half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure
whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe.
Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in
the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during
our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and
the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous
tension within him.

"Here we are!" said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room.
"The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold,
Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my
slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then!
You want to know what became of those geese?"

"Yes, sir."

"Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in
which you were interested--white, with a black bar across the
tail."

Ryder quivered with emotion. "Oh, sir," he cried, "can you tell
me where it went to?"

"It came here."

"Here?"

"Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don't wonder that
you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was
dead--the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen.
I have it here in my museum."

Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece
with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up
the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold,
brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a
drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.

"The game's up, Ryder," said Holmes quietly. "Hold up, man, or
you'll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair,
Watson. He's not got blood enough to go in for felony with
impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little
more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!"

For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy
brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring
with frightened eyes at his accuser.

"I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I
could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me.
Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case
complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the
Countess of Morcar's?"

"It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it," said he in a
crackling voice.

"I see--her ladyship's waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of
sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has
been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous
in the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the
making of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man
Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter
before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him.
What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady's
room--you and your confederate Cusack--and you managed that he
should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled
the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man
arrested. You then--"

Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my
companion's knees. "For God's sake, have mercy!" he shrieked.
"Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I
never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I'll
swear it on a Bible. Oh, don't bring it into court! For Christ's
sake, don't!"

"Get back into your chair!" said Holmes sternly. "It is very well
to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this
poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing."

"I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the
charge against him will break down."

"Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account
of the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came
the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies
your only hope of safety."

Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. "I will tell you
it just as it happened, sir," said he. "When Horner had been
arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get
away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment
the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my
room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe.
I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister's
house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton
Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there
every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective;
and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down
my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me
what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I
had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went
into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would
be best to do.

"I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and
has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met
me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they
could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to
me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind
to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my
confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money.
But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had
gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be
seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat
pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at
the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly
an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the
best detective that ever lived.

"My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the
pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she
was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in
it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in
the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds--a fine big
one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill
open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger
could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass
along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped
and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the
matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and
fluttered off among the others.

"'Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?' says she.

"'Well,' said I, 'you said you'd give me one for Christmas, and I
was feeling which was the fattest.'

"'Oh,' says she, 'we've set yours aside for you--Jem's bird, we
call it. It's the big white one over yonder. There's twenty-six
of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen
for the market.'

"'Thank you, Maggie,' says I; 'but if it is all the same to you,
I'd rather have that one I was handling just now.'

"'The other is a good three pound heavier,' said she, 'and we
fattened it expressly for you.'

"'Never mind. I'll have the other, and I'll take it now,' said I.

"'Oh, just as you like,' said she, a little huffed. 'Which is it
you want, then?'

"'That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the
flock.'

"'Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.'

"Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird
all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was
a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed
until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My
heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I
knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird,
rushed back to my sister's, and hurried into the back yard. There
was not a bird to be seen there.

"'Where are they all, Maggie?' I cried.

"'Gone to the dealer's, Jem.'

"'Which dealer's?'

"'Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.'

"'But was there another with a barred tail?' I asked, 'the same
as the one I chose?'

"'Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never
tell them apart.'

"Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my
feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the
lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they
had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always
answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad.
Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now--and now I am myself
a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which
I sold my character. God help me! God help me!" He burst into
convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.

There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and
by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes' finger-tips upon the
edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.

"Get out!" said he.

"What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!"

"No more words. Get out!"

And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon
the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running
footfalls from the street.

"After all, Watson," said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his
clay pipe, "I am not retained by the police to supply their
deficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing;
but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must
collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just
possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong
again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and
you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of
forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular and
whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you
will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin
another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief
feature."



VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND

On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I
have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend
Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number
merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did
rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of
wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation
which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic.
Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which
presented more singular features than that which was associated
with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran.
The events in question occurred in the early days of my
association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors
in Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them
upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the
time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by
the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It
is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I
have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the
death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even
more terrible than the truth.

It was early in April in the year '83 that I woke one morning to
find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my
bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the
mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I
blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little
resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.

"Very sorry to knock you up, Watson," said he, "but it's the
common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she
retorted upon me, and I on you."

"What is it, then--a fire?"

"No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a
considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She
is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander
about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock
sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is
something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it
prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to
follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should
call you and give you the chance."

"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything."

I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his
professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid
deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a
logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were
submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in
a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A
lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in
the window, rose as we entered.

"Good-morning, madam," said Holmes cheerily. "My name is Sherlock
Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson,
before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am
glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the
fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot
coffee, for I observe that you are shivering."

"It is not cold which makes me shiver," said the woman in a low
voice, changing her seat as requested.

"What, then?"

"It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror." She raised her veil as
she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable
state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless
frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features
and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot
with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard.
Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick,
all-comprehensive glances.

"You must not fear," said he soothingly, bending forward and
patting her forearm. "We shall soon set matters right, I have no
doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see."

"You know me, then?"

"No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm
of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had
a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached
the station."

The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my
companion.

"There is no mystery, my dear madam," said he, smiling. "The left
arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven
places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a
dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you
sit on the left-hand side of the driver."

"Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct," said
she. "I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at
twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I
can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues.
I have no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me,
and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you,
Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you
helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had
your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me,
too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness
which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward
you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be
married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you
shall not find me ungrateful."

Holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small
case-book, which he consulted.

"Farintosh," said he. "Ah yes, I recall the case; it was
concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time,
Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote
the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to
reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty
to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which
suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us
everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the
matter."

"Alas!" replied our visitor, "the very horror of my situation
lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions
depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to
another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to
look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it
as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can
read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have
heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold
wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid
the dangers which encompass me."

"I am all attention, madam."

"My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who
is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in
England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of
Surrey."

Holmes nodded his head. "The name is familiar to me," said he.

"The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the
estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north,
and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four
successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition,
and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the
days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground,
and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under
a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence
there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but
his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to
the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which
enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta,
where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he
established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused
by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he
beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital
sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and
afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.

"When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner,
the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery.
My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old
at the time of my mother's re-marriage. She had a considerable
sum of money--not less than 1000 pounds a year--and this she
bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him,
with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to
each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return
to England my mother died--she was killed eight years ago in a
railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his
attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us
to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The
money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and
there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.

"But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time.
Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our
neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of
Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in
his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious
quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper
approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the
family, and in my stepfather's case it had, I believe, been
intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of
disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the
police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village,
and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of
immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.

"Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a
stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I
could gather together that I was able to avert another public
exposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies,
and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few
acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate,
and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents,
wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a
passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a
correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon,
which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the
villagers almost as much as their master.

"You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I
had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with
us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was
but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already
begun to whiten, even as mine has."

"Your sister is dead, then?"

"She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish
to speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I
have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own
age and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother's maiden
sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we
were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's
house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there
a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My
stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and
offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of
the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event
occurred which has deprived me of my only companion."

Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes
closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his
lids now and glanced across at his visitor.

"Pray be precise as to details," said he.

"It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful
time is seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have
already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The
bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms
being in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms
the first is Dr. Roylott's, the second my sister's, and the third
my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open
out into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?"

"Perfectly so."

"The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That
fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we
knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled
by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom
to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where
she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At
eleven o'clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door
and looked back.

"'Tell me, Helen,' said she, 'have you ever heard anyone whistle
in the dead of the night?'

"'Never,' said I.

"'I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in
your sleep?'

"'Certainly not. But why?'

"'Because during the last few nights I have always, about three
in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper,
and it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from--perhaps
from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would
just ask you whether you had heard it.'

"'No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the
plantation.'

"'Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you
did not hear it also.'

"'Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.'

"'Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.' She smiled
back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her
key turn in the lock."

"Indeed," said Holmes. "Was it your custom always to lock
yourselves in at night?"

"Always."

"And why?"

"I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah
and a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were
locked."

"Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement."

"I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending
misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect,
were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two
souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind
was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing
against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale,
there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew
that it was my sister's voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a
shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door
I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and
a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had
fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister's door was unlocked,
and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it
horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By
the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the
opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for
help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a
drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that
moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground.
She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were
dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not
recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out
in a voice which I shall never forget, 'Oh, my God! Helen! It was
the band! The speckled band!' There was something else which she
would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the
air in the direction of the doctor's room, but a fresh convulsion
seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for
my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his
dressing-gown. When he reached my sister's side she was
unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent
for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for
she slowly sank and died without having recovered her
consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister."

"One moment," said Holmes, "are you sure about this whistle and
metallic sound? Could you swear to it?"

"That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is
my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of
the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have
been deceived."

"Was your sister dressed?"

"No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the
charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box."

"Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when
the alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did
the coroner come to?"

"He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott's
conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable
to find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that
the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows
were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars,
which were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded,
and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was
also thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is
wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain,
therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end.
Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her."

"How about poison?"

"The doctors examined her for it, but without success."

"What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?"

"It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock,
though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine."

"Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?"

"Yes, there are nearly always some there."

"Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band--a
speckled band?"

"Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of
delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of
people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not
know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear
over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which
she used."

Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.

"These are very deep waters," said he; "pray go on with your
narrative."

"Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until
lately lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend,
whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask
my hand in marriage. His name is Armitage--Percy Armitage--the
second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My
stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to
be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs
were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom
wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the
chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in
which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last
night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I
suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which
had been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the
lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to
go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was
daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which
is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on
this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your
advice."

"You have done wisely," said my friend. "But have you told me
all?"

"Yes, all."

"Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather."

"Why, what do you mean?"

For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which
fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee. Five little
livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed
upon the white wrist.

"You have been cruelly used," said Holmes.

The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. "He
is a hard man," she said, "and perhaps he hardly knows his own
strength."

There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin
upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.

"This is a very deep business," he said at last. "There are a
thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide
upon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If
we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for
us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your
stepfather?"

"As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some
most important business. It is probable that he will be away all
day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a
housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily
get her out of the way."

"Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?"

"By no means."

"Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?"

"I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am
in town. But I shall return by the twelve o'clock train, so as to
be there in time for your coming."

"And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some
small business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and
breakfast?"

"No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have
confided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you
again this afternoon." She dropped her thick black veil over her
face and glided from the room.

"And what do you think of it all, Watson?" asked Sherlock Holmes,
leaning back in his chair.

"It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business."

"Dark enough and sinister enough."

"Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls
are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable,
then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her
mysterious end."

"What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the
very peculiar words of the dying woman?"

"I cannot think."

"When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of
a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor,
the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has
an interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage, the dying
allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner
heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of
those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its
place, I think that there is good ground to think that the
mystery may be cleared along those lines."

"But what, then, did the gipsies do?"

"I cannot imagine."

"I see many objections to any such theory."

"And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going
to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are
fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of
the devil!"

The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that
our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had
framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar
mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a
black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters,
with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his
hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his
breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face,
seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and
marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other
of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,
fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old
bird of prey.

"Which of you is Holmes?" asked this apparition.

"My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me," said my
companion quietly.

"I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran."

"Indeed, Doctor," said Holmes blandly. "Pray take a seat."

"I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I
have traced her. What has she been saying to you?"

"It is a little cold for the time of the year," said Holmes.

"What has she been saying to you?" screamed the old man
furiously.

"But I have heard that the crocuses promise well," continued my
companion imperturbably.

"Ha! You put me off, do you?" said our new visitor, taking a step
forward and shaking his hunting-crop. "I know you, you scoundrel!
I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler."

My friend smiled.

"Holmes, the busybody!"

His smile broadened.

"Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!"

Holmes chuckled heartily. "Your conversation is most
entertaining," said he. "When you go out close the door, for
there is a decided draught."

"I will go when I have said my say. Don't you dare to meddle with
my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her!
I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here." He stepped
swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with
his huge brown hands.

"See that you keep yourself out of my grip," he snarled, and
hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the
room.

"He seems a very amiable person," said Holmes, laughing. "I am
not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him
that my grip was not much more feeble than his own." As he spoke
he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort,
straightened it out again.

"Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official
detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,
however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer
from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now,
Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk
down to Doctors' Commons, where I hope to get some data which may
help us in this matter."


It was nearly one o'clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his
excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled
over with notes and figures.

"I have seen the will of the deceased wife," said he. "To
determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the
present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The
total income, which at the time of the wife's death was little
short of 1100 pounds, is now, through the fall in agricultural
prices, not more than 750 pounds. Each daughter can claim an
income of 250 pounds, in case of marriage. It is evident,
therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have
had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to
a very serious extent. My morning's work has not been wasted,
since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for
standing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson,
this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is
aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you
are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be
very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your
pocket. An Eley's No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen
who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush
are, I think, all that we need."

At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for
Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove
for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a
perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the
heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out
their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant
smell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange
contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this
sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in
the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over
his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the
deepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the
shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.

"Look there!" said he.

A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope,
thickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the
branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a
very old mansion.

"Stoke Moran?" said he.

"Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott," remarked
the driver.

"There is some building going on there," said Holmes; "that is
where we are going."

"There's the village," said the driver, pointing to a cluster of
roofs some distance to the left; "but if you want to get to the
house, you'll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by
the foot-path over the fields. There it is, where the lady is
walking."

"And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner," observed Holmes, shading
his eyes. "Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest."

We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way
to Leatherhead.

"I thought it as well," said Holmes as we climbed the stile,
"that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or
on some definite business. It may stop his gossip.
Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as
our word."

Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a
face which spoke her joy. "I have been waiting so eagerly for
you," she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. "All has turned
out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely
that he will be back before evening."

"We have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance,"
said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had
occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.

"Good heavens!" she cried, "he has followed me, then."

"So it appears."

"He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What
will he say when he returns?"

"He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone
more cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself
up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to
your aunt's at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our
time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to
examine."

The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high
central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab,
thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were
broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly
caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little
better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern,
and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up
from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided.
Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the
stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any
workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and
down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the
outsides of the windows.

"This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep,
the centre one to your sister's, and the one next to the main
building to Dr. Roylott's chamber?"

"Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one."

"Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does
not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end
wall."

"There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from
my room."

"Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow
wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There
are windows in it, of course?"

"Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass
through."

"As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were
unapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness
to go into your room and bar your shutters?"

Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination
through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the
shutter open, but without success. There was no slit through
which a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his
lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built
firmly into the massive masonry. "Hum!" said he, scratching his
chin in some perplexity, "my theory certainly presents some
difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were
bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon
the matter."

A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which
the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third
chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss
Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her
fate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a
gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A
brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow
white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the
left-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small
wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save
for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and
the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old
and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building
of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat
silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down,
taking in every detail of the apartment.

"Where does that bell communicate with?" he asked at last
pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the
tassel actually lying upon the pillow.

"It goes to the housekeeper's room."

"It looks newer than the other things?"

"Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago."

"Your sister asked for it, I suppose?"

"No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we
wanted for ourselves."

"Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there.
You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to
this floor." He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in
his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining
minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with
the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he
walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and
in running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the
bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.

"Why, it's a dummy," said he.

"Won't it ring?"

"No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting.
You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where
the little opening for the ventilator is."

"How very absurd! I never noticed that before."

"Very strange!" muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. "There are
one or two very singular points about this room. For example,
what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another
room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated
with the outside air!"

"That is also quite modern," said the lady.

"Done about the same time as the bell-rope?" remarked Holmes.

"Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that
time."

"They seem to have been of a most interesting character--dummy
bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your
permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into
the inner apartment."

Dr. Grimesby Roylott's chamber was larger than that of his
step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small
wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an
armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a
round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things
which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each
and all of them with the keenest interest.

"What's in here?" he asked, tapping the safe.

"My stepfather's business papers."

"Oh! you have seen inside, then?"

"Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of
papers."

"There isn't a cat in it, for example?"

"No. What a strange idea!"

"Well, look at this!" He took up a small saucer of milk which
stood on the top of it.

"No; we don't keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon."

"Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a
saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I
daresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine." He
squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat
of it with the greatest attention.

"Thank you. That is quite settled," said he, rising and putting
his lens in his pocket. "Hullo! Here is something interesting!"

The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on
one corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself
and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.

"What do you make of that, Watson?"

"It's a common enough lash. But I don't know why it should be
tied."

"That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it's a wicked world,
and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst
of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and
with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn."

I had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as
it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We
had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss
Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he
roused himself from his reverie.

"It is very essential, Miss Stoner," said he, "that you should
absolutely follow my advice in every respect."

"I shall most certainly do so."

"The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may
depend upon your compliance."

"I assure you that I am in your hands."

"In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in
your room."

Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.

"Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the
village inn over there?"

"Yes, that is the Crown."

"Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?"

"Certainly."

"You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a
headache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him
retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window,
undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then
withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want
into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in
spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night."

"Oh, yes, easily."

"The rest you will leave in our hands."

"But what will you do?"

"We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate
the cause of this noise which has disturbed you."

"I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,"
said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve.

"Perhaps I have."

"Then, for pity's sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister's
death."

"I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak."

"You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and
if she died from some sudden fright."

"No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more
tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if
Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain.
Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you,
you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers
that threaten you."

Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and
sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and
from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and
of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw
Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside
the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some
slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard
the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which
he shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few
minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as
the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.

"Do you know, Watson," said Holmes as we sat together in the
gathering darkness, "I have really some scruples as to taking you
to-night. There is a distinct element of danger."

"Can I be of assistance?"

"Your presence might be invaluable."

"Then I shall certainly come."

"It is very kind of you."

"You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms
than was visible to me."

"No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine
that you saw all that I did."

"I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose
that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine."

"You saw the ventilator, too?"

"Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to
have a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a
rat could hardly pass through."

"I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to
Stoke Moran."

"My dear Holmes!"

"Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her
sister could smell Dr. Roylott's cigar. Now, of course that
suggested at once that there must be a communication between the
two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been
remarked upon at the coroner's inquiry. I deduced a ventilator."

"But what harm can there be in that?"

"Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A
ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the
bed dies. Does not that strike you?"

"I cannot as yet see any connection."

"Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?"

"No."

"It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened
like that before?"

"I cannot say that I have."

"The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same
relative position to the ventilator and to the rope--or so we may
call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull."

"Holmes," I cried, "I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at.
We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible
crime."

"Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong
he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge.
Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession.
This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall
be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough
before the night is over; for goodness' sake let us have a quiet
pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more
cheerful."


About nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished,
and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours
passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of
eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.

"That is our signal," said Holmes, springing to his feet; "it
comes from the middle window."

As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord,
explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance,
and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A
moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing
in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us
through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.

There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for
unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way
among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about
to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel
bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted
child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and
then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.

"My God!" I whispered; "did you see it?"

Holmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like
a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low
laugh and put his lips to my ear.

"It is a nice household," he murmured. "That is the baboon."

I had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There
was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders
at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when,
after following Holmes' example and slipping off my shoes, I
found myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed
the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes
round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then
creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered
into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to
distinguish the words:

"The least sound would be fatal to our plans."

I nodded to show that I had heard.

"We must sit without light. He would see it through the
ventilator."

I nodded again.

"Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your
pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of
the bed, and you in that chair."

I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.

Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon
the bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the
stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left
in darkness.

How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a
sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my
companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same
state of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut
off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.

From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at
our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that
the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the
deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of
an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and
one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for
whatever might befall.

Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the
direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was
succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal.
Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle
sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the
smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears.
Then suddenly another sound became audible--a very gentle,
soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping
continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes
sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with
his cane at the bell-pull.

"You see it, Watson?" he yelled. "You see it?"

But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I
heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my
weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which
my friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face
was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had
ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when
suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most
horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder
and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled
in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the
village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the
sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I
stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it
had died away into the silence from which it rose.

"What can it mean?" I gasped.

"It means that it is all over," Holmes answered. "And perhaps,
after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will
enter Dr. Roylott's room."

With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the
corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply
from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his
heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.

It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a
dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant
beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar.
Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott
clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding
beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers.
Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we
had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his
eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the
ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with
brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his
head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.

"The band! the speckled band!" whispered Holmes.

I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began
to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat
diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.

"It is a swamp adder!" cried Holmes; "the deadliest snake in
India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence
does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls
into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this
creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to
some place of shelter and let the county police know what has
happened."

As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap,
and throwing the noose round the reptile's neck he drew it from
its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm's length, threw it into
the iron safe, which he closed upon it.

Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of
Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a
narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling
how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed
her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow,
of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the
conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly
playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn
of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back
next day.

"I had," said he, "come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which
shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from
insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of
the word 'band,' which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to
explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of
by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an
entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly
reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me
that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not
come either from the window or the door. My attention was
speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this
ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The
discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to
the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was
there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and
coming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me,
and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was
furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I
was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of
poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical
test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless
man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such
a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be
an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could
distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where
the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the
whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning
light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by
the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned.
He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he
thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the
rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the
occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but
sooner or later she must fall a victim.

"I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his
room. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in
the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary
in order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the
safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to
finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic
clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather
hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant.
Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in
order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss
as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the
light and attacked it."

"With the result of driving it through the ventilator."

"And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master
at the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and
roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person
it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr.
Grimesby Roylott's death, and I cannot say that it is likely to
weigh very heavily upon my conscience."



IX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB

Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr.
Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy,
there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his
notice--that of Mr. Hatherley's thumb, and that of Colonel
Warburton's madness. Of these the latter may have afforded a
finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was
so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that
it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it
gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of
reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The story
has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but,
like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when
set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the
facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears
gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads
on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a
deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly
served to weaken the effect.

It was in the summer of '89, not long after my marriage, that the
events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned
to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker
Street rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally
even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come
and visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I
happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington
Station, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of
these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was
never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send
me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.

One morning, at a little before seven o'clock, I was awakened by
the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come
from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I
dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases
were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my
old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door
tightly behind him.

"I've got him here," he whispered, jerking his thumb over his
shoulder; "he's all right."

"What is it, then?" I asked, for his manner suggested that it was
some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.

"It's a new patient," he whispered. "I thought I'd bring him
round myself; then he couldn't slip away. There he is, all safe
and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the
same as you." And off he went, this trusty tout, without even
giving me time to thank him.

I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the
table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a
soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of
his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all
over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than
five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but
he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who
was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his
strength of mind to control.

"I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor," said he, "but I
have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by
train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I
might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me
here. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon
the side-table."

I took it up and glanced at it. "Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic
engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor)." That was the name,
style, and abode of my morning visitor. "I regret that I have
kept you waiting," said I, sitting down in my library-chair. "You
are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself
a monotonous occupation."

"Oh, my night could not be called monotonous," said he, and
laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note,
leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical
instincts rose up against that laugh.

"Stop it!" I cried; "pull yourself together!" and I poured out
some water from a caraffe.

It was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical
outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis
is over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very
weary and pale-looking.

"I have been making a fool of myself," he gasped.

"Not at all. Drink this." I dashed some brandy into the water,
and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.

"That's better!" said he. "And now, Doctor, perhaps you would
kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb
used to be."

He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even
my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four
protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the
thumb should have been. It had been hacked or torn right out from
the roots.

"Good heavens!" I cried, "this is a terrible injury. It must have
bled considerably."

"Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must
have been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that
it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very
tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig."

"Excellent! You should have been a surgeon."

"It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own
province."

"This has been done," said I, examining the wound, "by a very
heavy and sharp instrument."

"A thing like a cleaver," said he.

"An accident, I presume?"

"By no means."

"What! a murderous attack?"

"Very murderous indeed."

"You horrify me."

I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered
it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back
without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.

"How is that?" I asked when I had finished.

"Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man.
I was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through."

"Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently
trying to your nerves."

"Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police;
but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing
evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they
believed my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I
have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and,
even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so
vague that it is a question whether justice will be done."

"Ha!" cried I, "if it is anything in the nature of a problem
which you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you
to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the
official police."

"Oh, I have heard of that fellow," answered my visitor, "and I
should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of
course I must use the official police as well. Would you give me
an introduction to him?"

"I'll do better. I'll take you round to him myself."

"I should be immensely obliged to you."

"We'll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to
have a little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?"

"Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story."

"Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an
instant." I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my
wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my
new acquaintance to Baker Street.

Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his
sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The
Times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed
of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day
before, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the
mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion,
ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal.
When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the
sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of
brandy and water within his reach.

"It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one,
Mr. Hatherley," said he. "Pray, lie down there and make yourself
absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are
tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant."

"Thank you," said my patient. "but I have felt another man since
the doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has
completed the cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable
time as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar
experiences."

Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded
expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat
opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story
which our visitor detailed to us.

"You must know," said he, "that I am an orphan and a bachelor,
residing alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a
hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my
work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner &
Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago,
having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of
money through my poor father's death, I determined to start in
business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria
Street.

"I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in
business a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so.
During two years I have had three consultations and one small
job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought
me. My gross takings amount to 27 pounds 10s. Every day, from
nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my
little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to
believe that I should never have any practice at all.

"Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the
office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who
wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with
the name of 'Colonel Lysander Stark' engraved upon it. Close at
his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle
size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have
ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose
and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over
his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his
natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his
step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly
dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than
thirty.

"'Mr. Hatherley?' said he, with something of a German accent.
'You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man
who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet
and capable of preserving a secret.'

"I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an
address. 'May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?'

"'Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just
at this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both
an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.'

"'That is quite correct,' I answered; 'but you will excuse me if
I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional
qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter
that you wished to speak to me?'

"'Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to
the point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute
secrecy is quite essential--absolute secrecy, you understand, and
of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than
from one who lives in the bosom of his family.'

"'If I promise to keep a secret,' said I, 'you may absolutely
depend upon my doing so.'

"He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I
had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.

"'Do you promise, then?' said he at last.

"'Yes, I promise.'

"'Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No
reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?'

"'I have already given you my word.'

"'Very good.' He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning
across the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was
empty.

"'That's all right,' said he, coming back. 'I know that clerks are
sometimes curious as to their master's affairs. Now we can talk
in safety.' He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to
stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.

"A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun
to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man.
Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from
showing my impatience.

"'I beg that you will state your business, sir,' said I; 'my time
is of value.' Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the
words came to my lips.

"'How would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you?' he asked.

"'Most admirably.'

"'I say a night's work, but an hour's would be nearer the mark. I
simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which
has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon
set it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as
that?'

"'The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.'

"'Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last
train.'

"'Where to?'

"'To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders
of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a
train from Paddington which would bring you there at about
11:15.'

"'Very good.'

"'I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.'

"'There is a drive, then?'

"'Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good
seven miles from Eyford Station.'

"'Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there
would be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop
the night.'

"'Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.'

"'That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient
hour?'

"'We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to
recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a
young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the
very heads of your profession. Still, of course, if you would
like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do
so.'

"I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they
would be to me. 'Not at all,' said I, 'I shall be very happy to
accommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to
understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to
do.'

"'Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which
we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I
have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all
laid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from
eavesdroppers?'

"'Entirely.'

"'Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that
fuller's-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found
in one or two places in England?'

"'I have heard so.'

"'Some little time ago I bought a small place--a very small
place--within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to
discover that there was a deposit of fuller's-earth in one of my
fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a
comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two
very much larger ones upon the right and left--both of them,
however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were
absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was
quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my
interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value,
but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I
took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they
suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little
deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would
enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been
doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we
erected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have already
explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the
subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it
once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our
little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts
came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these
fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you
promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are
going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?'

"'I quite follow you,' said I. 'The only point which I could not
quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press
in excavating fuller's-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out
like gravel from a pit.'

"'Ah!' said he carelessly, 'we have our own process. We compress
the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing
what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully
into my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I
trust you.' He rose as he spoke. 'I shall expect you, then, at
Eyford at 11:15.'

"'I shall certainly be there.'

"'And not a word to a soul.' He looked at me with a last long,
questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank
grasp, he hurried from the room.

"Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very
much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission
which had been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was
glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked
had I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that
this order might lead to other ones. On the other hand, the face
and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon
me, and I could not think that his explanation of the
fuller's-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my
coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell
anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate
a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having
obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.

"At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station.
However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I
reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock. I was the
only passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the
platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed
out through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of
the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a
word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door
of which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either
side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the
horse could go."

"One horse?" interjected Holmes.

"Yes, only one."

"Did you observe the colour?"

"Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the
carriage. It was a chestnut."

"Tired-looking or fresh?"

"Oh, fresh and glossy."

"Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue
your most interesting statement."

"Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel
Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I
should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the
time that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. He sat
at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than
once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me
with great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good
in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I
tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we
were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out
nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now
and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the
journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the
conversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the
road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive,
and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang
out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch
which gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of
the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the
most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The instant that
I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us,
and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage
drove away.

"It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled
about looking for matches and muttering under his breath.
Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a
long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. It grew
broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she
held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us.
I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which
the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich
material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as
though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a
gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly
fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered
something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room
from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the
lamp in his hand.

"'Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a
few minutes,' said he, throwing open another door. It was a
quiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the
centre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel
Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the
door. 'I shall not keep you waiting an instant,' said he, and
vanished into the darkness.

"I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my
ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises
on science, the others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked
across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of
the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded
across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old
clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise
everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began
to steal over me. Who were these German people, and what were
they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And
where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was
all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no
idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns,
were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded,
after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness,
that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room,
humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling
that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.

"Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the
utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman
was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind
her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and
beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with
fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one
shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few
whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back,
like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.

"'I would go,' said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to
speak calmly; 'I would go. I should not stay here. There is no
good for you to do.'

"'But, madam,' said I, 'I have not yet done what I came for. I
cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.'

"'It is not worth your while to wait,' she went on. 'You can pass
through the door; no one hinders.' And then, seeing that I smiled
and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and
made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. 'For the love
of Heaven!' she whispered, 'get away from here before it is too
late!'

"But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to
engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I
thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of
the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to
go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried
out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This
woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout
bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I
cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention
of remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties
when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps
was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up
her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and
as noiselessly as she had come.

"The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man
with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double
chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.

"'This is my secretary and manager,' said the colonel. 'By the
way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just
now. I fear that you have felt the draught.'

"'On the contrary,' said I, 'I opened the door myself because I
felt the room to be a little close.'

"He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. 'Perhaps we had
better proceed to business, then,' said he. 'Mr. Ferguson and I
will take you up to see the machine.'

"'I had better put my hat on, I suppose.'

"'Oh, no, it is in the house.'

"'What, you dig fuller's-earth in the house?'

"'No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that.
All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us
know what is wrong with it.'

"We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the
fat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house,
with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little
low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the
generations who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no
signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster
was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in
green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an
air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the
lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon
my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent
man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at
least a fellow-countryman.

"Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which
he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three
of us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside,
and the colonel ushered me in.

"'We are now,' said he, 'actually within the hydraulic press, and
it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were
to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the
end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of
many tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns
of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and
multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine
goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working
of it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will
have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set
it right.'

"I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very
thoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of
exercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, and
pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by
the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed
a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An
examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was
round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to
fill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause
of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who
followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical
questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I
had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the
machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity.
It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller's-earth
was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose
that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a
purpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a
large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a
crust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was
scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a
muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the
colonel looking down at me.

"'What are you doing there?' he asked.

"I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as
that which he had told me. 'I was admiring your fuller's-earth,'
said I; 'I think that I should be better able to advise you as to
your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it
was used.'

"The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of
my speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in
his grey eyes.

"'Very well,' said he, 'you shall know all about the machine.' He
took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key
in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it
was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and
shoves. 'Hullo!' I yelled. 'Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!'

"And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my
heart into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish
of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp
still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining
the trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming
down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than
myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a
shapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and
dragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let
me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my
cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with
my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it
flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend
very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my
face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to
think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and
yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black
shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand
erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope
back to my heart.

"I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the
walls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw
a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which
broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For
an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door
which led away from death. The next instant I threw myself
through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had
closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few
moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me
how narrow had been my escape.

"I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and
I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor,
while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand,
while she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend
whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.

"'Come! come!' she cried breathlessly. 'They will be here in a
moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste
the so-precious time, but come!'

"This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to
my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding
stair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we
reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of
two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which  we
were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about
her like one  who is at her wit's end. Then she threw open a door
which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon
was shining brightly.

"'It is your only chance,' said she. 'It is high, but it may be
that you can jump it.'

"As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the
passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark
rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a
butcher's cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom,
flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and
wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be
more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I
hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between
my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used,
then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance.
The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at
the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round
him and tried to hold him back.

"'Fritz! Fritz!' she cried in English, 'remember your promise
after the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be
silent! Oh, he will be silent!'

"'You are mad, Elise!' he shouted, struggling to break away from
her. 'You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me
pass, I say!' He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the
window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and
was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was
conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the
garden below.

"I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and
rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I
understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly,
however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me.
I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and
then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and
that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my
handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my
ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the
rose-bushes.

"How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been
a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was
breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with
dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded
thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the
particulars of my night's adventure, and I sprang to my feet with
the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But
to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house
nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the
hedge close by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a
long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the
very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were
it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed
during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.

"Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning
train. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The
same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I
arrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel
Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a
carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was
there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three
miles off.

"It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined
to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the
police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first
to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to
bring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do
exactly what you advise."

We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to
this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down
from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he
placed his cuttings.

"Here is an advertisement which will interest you," said he. "It
appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this:
'Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged
twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten
o'clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was
dressed in,' etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that
the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy."

"Good heavens!" cried my patient. "Then that explains what the
girl said."

"Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and
desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should
stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out
pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well,
every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall
go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for
Eyford."

Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train
together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village.
There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector
Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself.
Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the
seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford
for its centre.

"There you are," said he. "That circle is drawn at a radius of
ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere
near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir."

"It was an hour's good drive."

"And you think that they brought you back all that way when you
were unconscious?"

"They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having
been lifted and conveyed somewhere."

"What I cannot understand," said I, "is why they should have
spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden.
Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties."

"I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face
in my life."

"Oh, we shall soon clear up all that," said Bradstreet. "Well, I
have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon
it the folk that we are in search of are to be found."

"I think I could lay my finger on it," said Holmes quietly.

"Really, now!" cried the inspector, "you have formed your
opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is
south, for the country is more deserted there."

"And I say east," said my patient.

"I am for west," remarked the plain-clothes man. "There are
several quiet little villages up there."

"And I am for north," said I, "because there are no hills there,
and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up
any."

"Come," cried the inspector, laughing; "it's a very pretty
diversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do
you give your casting vote to?"

"You are all wrong."

"But we can't all be."

"Oh, yes, you can. This is my point." He placed his finger in the
centre of the circle. "This is where we shall find them."

"But the twelve-mile drive?" gasped Hatherley.

"Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the
horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that
if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?"

"Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough," observed Bradstreet
thoughtfully. "Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature
of this gang."

"None at all," said Holmes. "They are coiners on a large scale,
and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the
place of silver."

"We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,"
said the inspector. "They have been turning out half-crowns by
the thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could
get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that
showed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this
lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough."

But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not
destined to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into
Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed
up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and
hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.

"A house on fire?" asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off
again on its way.

"Yes, sir!" said the station-master.

"When did it break out?"

"I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse,
and the whole place is in a blaze."

"Whose house is it?"

"Dr. Becher's."

"Tell me," broke in the engineer, "is Dr. Becher a German, very
thin, with a long, sharp nose?"

The station-master laughed heartily. "No, sir, Dr. Becher is an
Englishman, and there isn't a man in the parish who has a
better-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him,
a patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as
if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm."

The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all
hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low
hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in
front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in
the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to
keep the flames under.

"That's it!" cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. "There is
the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That
second window is the one that I jumped from."

"Well, at least," said Holmes, "you have had your revenge upon
them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which,
when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls,
though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to
observe it at the time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for
your friends of last night, though I very much fear that they are
a good hundred miles off by now."

And Holmes' fears came to be realised, for from that day to this
no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the
sinister German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a
peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very
bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but
there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes'
ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their
whereabouts.

The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements
which they had found within, and still more so by discovering a
newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor.
About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and
they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in,
and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save
some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of
the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so
dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored
in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have
explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been
already referred to.

How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to
the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained
forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a
very plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two
persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other
unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the
silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his
companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out
of the way of danger.

"Well," said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return
once more to London, "it has been a pretty business for me! I
have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what
have I gained?"

"Experience," said Holmes, laughing. "Indirectly it may be of
value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the
reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your
existence."



X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR

The Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have
long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles
in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have
eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the
gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to
believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to
the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a
considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no
memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of
this remarkable episode.

It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I
was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came
home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table
waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather
had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and
the Jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as
a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence.
With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had
surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last,
saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and
lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the
envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend's
noble correspondent could be.

"Here is a very fashionable epistle," I remarked as he entered.
"Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a
fish-monger and a tide-waiter."

"Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety," he
answered, smiling, "and the humbler are usually the more
interesting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social
summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie."

He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.

"Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all."

"Not social, then?"

"No, distinctly professional."

"And from a noble client?"

"One of the highest in England."

"My dear fellow, I congratulate you."

"I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my
client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his
case. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be
wanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the
papers diligently of late, have you not?"

"It looks like it," said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in
the corner. "I have had nothing else to do."

"It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I
read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The
latter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent
events so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his
wedding?"

"Oh, yes, with the deepest interest."

"That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord
St. Simon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn
over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter.
This is what he says:

"'MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:--Lord Backwater tells me that I
may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I
have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you
in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in
connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is
acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no
objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that
it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o'clock in
the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that
time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of
paramount importance. Yours faithfully, ST. SIMON.'

"It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen,
and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink
upon the outer side of his right little finger," remarked Holmes
as he folded up the epistle.

"He says four o'clock. It is three now. He will be here in an
hour."

"Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon
the subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in
their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client
is." He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of
reference beside the mantelpiece. "Here he is," said he, sitting
down and flattening it out upon his knee. "'Lord Robert Walsingham
de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.' Hum! 'Arms:
Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.'
He's forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was
Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration. The
Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs.
They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on
the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in
all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something
more solid."

"I have very little difficulty in finding what I want," said I,
"for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as
remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew
that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the
intrusion of other matters."

"Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square
furniture van. That is quite cleared up now--though, indeed, it
was obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your
newspaper selections."

"Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal
column of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks
back: 'A marriage has been arranged,' it says, 'and will, if
rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert
St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty
Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San
Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.' That is all."

"Terse and to the point," remarked Holmes, stretching his long,
thin legs towards the fire.

"There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society
papers of the same week. Ah, here it is: 'There will soon be a
call for protection in the marriage market, for the present
free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home
product. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great
Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across
the Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last
week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by
these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself
for over twenty years proof against the little god's arrows, has
now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty
Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss
Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much
attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child,
and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to
considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the
future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has
been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years,
and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small
estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress
is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to
make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a
British peeress.'"

"Anything else?" asked Holmes, yawning.

"Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post
to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it
would be at St. George's, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen
intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would
return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been
taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later--that is, on
Wednesday last--there is a curt announcement that the wedding had
taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord
Backwater's place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices
which appeared before the disappearance of the bride."

"Before the what?" asked Holmes with a start.

"The vanishing of the lady."

"When did she vanish, then?"

"At the wedding breakfast."

"Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite
dramatic, in fact."

"Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common."

"They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during
the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt
as this. Pray let me have the details."

"I warn you that they are very incomplete."

"Perhaps we may make them less so."

"Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a
morning paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is
headed, 'Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding':

"'The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the
greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which
have taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as
shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the
previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to
confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently
floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush
the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it
that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what
is a common subject for conversation.

"'The ceremony, which was performed at St. George's, Hanover
Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the
father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral,
Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the
younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia
Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of
Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been
prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a
woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to
force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging
that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a
painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler
and the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house
before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast
with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and
retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some
comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that
she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an
ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the
footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus
apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress,
believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his
daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with
the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with
the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which
will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very
singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing
had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There
are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the
police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the
original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some
other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange
disappearance of the bride.'"

"And is that all?"

"Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is
a suggestive one."

"And it is--"

"That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance,
has actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a
danseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom
for some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole
case is in your hands now--so far as it has been set forth in the
public press."

"And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would
not have missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell,
Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I
have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not
dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness,
if only as a check to my own memory."

"Lord Robert St. Simon," announced our page-boy, throwing open
the door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face,
high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about
the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose
pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His
manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue
impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little
bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off
his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin
upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of
foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat,
yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters.
He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to
right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his
golden eyeglasses.

"Good-day, Lord St. Simon," said Holmes, rising and bowing. "Pray
take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr.
Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this
matter over."

"A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine,
Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you
have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir,
though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of
society."

"No, I am descending."

"I beg pardon."

"My last client of the sort was a king."

"Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?"

"The King of Scandinavia."

"What! Had he lost his wife?"

"You can understand," said Holmes suavely, "that I extend to the
affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to
you in yours."

"Of course! Very right! very right! I'm sure I beg pardon. As to
my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may
assist you in forming an opinion."

"Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public
prints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct--
this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride."

Lord St. Simon glanced over it. "Yes, it is correct, as far as it
goes."

"But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could
offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most
directly by questioning you."

"Pray do so."

"When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?"

"In San Francisco, a year ago."

"You were travelling in the States?"

"Yes."

"Did you become engaged then?"

"No."

"But you were on a friendly footing?"

"I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was
amused."

"Her father is very rich?"

"He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope."

"And how did he make his money?"

"In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold,
invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds."

"Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady's--your
wife's character?"

The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down
into the fire. "You see, Mr. Holmes," said he, "my wife was
twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she
ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or
mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than
from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy,
with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of
traditions. She is impetuous--volcanic, I was about to say. She
is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her
resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the
name which I have the honour to bear"--he gave a little stately
cough--"had not I thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I
believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that
anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her."

"Have you her photograph?"

"I brought this with me." He opened a locket and showed us the
full face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an
ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect
of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the
exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he
closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.

"The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your
acquaintance?"

"Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I
met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now
married her."

"She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?"

"A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family."

"And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a
fait accompli?"

"I really have made no inquiries on the subject."

"Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the
wedding?"

"Yes."

"Was she in good spirits?"

"Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our
future lives."

"Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the
wedding?"

"She was as bright as possible--at least until after the
ceremony."

"And did you observe any change in her then?"

"Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had
ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident
however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible
bearing upon the case."

"Pray let us have it, for all that."

"Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards
the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it
fell over into the pew. There was a moment's delay, but the
gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not
appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of
the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our
way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause."

"Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of
the general public were present, then?"

"Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is
open."

"This gentleman was not one of your wife's friends?"

"No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a
common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But
really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point."

"Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less
cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do
on re-entering her father's house?"

"I saw her in conversation with her maid."

"And who is her maid?"

"Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California
with her."

"A confidential servant?"

"A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed
her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they
look upon these things in a different way."

"How long did she speak to this Alice?"

"Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of."

"You did not overhear what they said?"

"Lady St. Simon said something about 'jumping a claim.' She was
accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she
meant."

"American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your
wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?"

"She walked into the breakfast-room."

"On your arm?"

"No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that.
Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose
hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She
never came back."

"But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to
her room, covered her bride's dress with a long ulster, put on a
bonnet, and went out."

"Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in
company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who
had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran's house that
morning."

"Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady,
and your relations to her."

Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows.
"We have been on a friendly footing for some years--I may say on
a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have
not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of
complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes.
Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and
devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she
heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the
reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I
feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to
Mr. Doran's door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to
push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my
wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the
possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police
fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again.
She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a
row."

"Did your wife hear all this?"

"No, thank goodness, she did not."

"And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?"

"Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as
so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid
some terrible trap for her."

"Well, it is a possible supposition."

"You think so, too?"

"I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon
this as likely?"

"I do not think Flora would hurt a fly."

"Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray
what is your own theory as to what took place?"

"Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I
have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may
say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of
this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a
social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous
disturbance in my wife."

"In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?"

"Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back--I
will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to
without success--I can hardly explain it in any other fashion."

"Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis," said
Holmes, smiling. "And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have
nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the
breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?"

"We could see the other side of the road and the Park."

"Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer.
I shall communicate with you."

"Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem," said our
client, rising.

"I have solved it."

"Eh? What was that?"

"I say that I have solved it."

"Where, then, is my wife?"

"That is a detail which I shall speedily supply."

Lord St. Simon shook his head. "I am afraid that it will take
wiser heads than yours or mine," he remarked, and bowing in a
stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.

"It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting
it on a level with his own," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "I
think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all
this cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the
case before our client came into the room."

"My dear Holmes!"

"I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I
remarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination
served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial
evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a
trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau's example."

"But I have heard all that you have heard."

"Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which
serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some
years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich
the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these
cases--but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade!
You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are
cigars in the box."

The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat,
which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a
black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated
himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.

"What's up, then?" asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. "You
look dissatisfied."

"And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage
case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business."

"Really! You surprise me."

"Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip
through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day."

"And very wet it seems to have made you," said Holmes laying his
hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.

"Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine."

"In heaven's name, what for?"

"In search of the body of Lady St. Simon."

Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.

"Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?" he
asked.

"Why? What do you mean?"

"Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in
the one as in the other."

Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. "I suppose you
know all about it," he snarled.

"Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up."

"Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in
the matter?"

"I think it very unlikely."

"Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found
this in it?" He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the
floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin
shoes and a bride's wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked
in water. "There," said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the
top of the pile. "There is a little nut for you to crack, Master
Holmes."

"Oh, indeed!" said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air.
"You dragged them from the Serpentine?"

"No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper.
They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me
that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off."

"By the same brilliant reasoning, every man's body is to be found
in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope
to arrive at through this?"

"At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance."

"I am afraid that you will find it difficult."

"Are you, indeed, now?" cried Lestrade with some bitterness. "I
am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your
deductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as
many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar."

"And how?"

"In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the
card-case is a note. And here is the very note." He slapped it
down upon the table in front of him. "Listen to this: 'You will
see me when all is ready. Come at once. F.H.M.' Now my theory all
along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora
Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was
responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her
initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped
into her hand at the door and which lured her within their
reach."

"Very good, Lestrade," said Holmes, laughing. "You really are
very fine indeed. Let me see it." He took up the paper in a
listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he
gave a little cry of satisfaction. "This is indeed important,"
said he.

"Ha! you find it so?"

"Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly."

Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. "Why," he
shrieked, "you're looking at the wrong side!"

"On the contrary, this is the right side."

"The right side? You're mad! Here is the note written in pencil
over here."

"And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel
bill, which interests me deeply."

"There's nothing in it. I looked at it before," said Lestrade.
"'Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s.
6d., glass sherry, 8d.' I see nothing in that."

"Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the
note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I
congratulate you again."

"I've wasted time enough," said Lestrade, rising. "I believe in
hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories.
Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom
of the matter first." He gathered up the garments, thrust them
into the bag, and made for the door.

"Just one hint to you, Lestrade," drawled Holmes before his rival
vanished; "I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady
St. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any
such person."

Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me,
tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and
hurried away.

He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on
his overcoat. "There is something in what the fellow says about
outdoor work," he remarked, "so I think, Watson, that I must
leave you to your papers for a little."

It was after five o'clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had
no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a
confectioner's man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked
with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and
presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean
little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble
lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold
woodcock, a pheasant, a pï¿½tï¿½ de foie gras pie with a group of
ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries,
my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian
Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid
for and were ordered to this address.

Just before nine o'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the
room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his
eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his
conclusions.

"They have laid the supper, then," he said, rubbing his hands.

"You seem to expect company. They have laid for five."

"Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in," said he. "I
am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I
fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs."

It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in,
dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very
perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.

"My messenger reached you, then?" asked Holmes.

"Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure.
Have you good authority for what you say?"

"The best possible."

Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his
forehead.

"What will the Duke say," he murmured, "when he hears that one of
the family has been subjected to such humiliation?"

"It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any
humiliation."

"Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint."

"I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the
lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of
doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she
had no one to advise her at such a crisis."

"It was a slight, sir, a public slight," said Lord St. Simon,
tapping his fingers upon the table.

"You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so
unprecedented a position."

"I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have
been shamefully used."

"I think that I heard a ring," said Holmes. "Yes, there are steps
on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view
of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here
who may be more successful." He opened the door and ushered in a
lady and gentleman. "Lord St. Simon," said he "allow me to
introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I
think, you have already met."

At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his
seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand
thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended
dignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out
her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was
as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was
one which it was hard to resist.

"You're angry, Robert," said she. "Well, I guess you have every
cause to be."

"Pray make no apology to me," said Lord St. Simon bitterly.

"Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I
should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of
rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just
didn't know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn't
fall down and do a faint right there before the altar."

"Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave
the room while you explain this matter?"

"If I may give an opinion," remarked the strange gentleman,
"we've had just a little too much secrecy over this business
already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to
hear the rights of it." He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man,
clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.

"Then I'll tell our story right away," said the lady. "Frank here
and I met in '84, in McQuire's camp, near the Rockies, where pa
was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I;
but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile,
while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to
nothing. The richer pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last pa
wouldn't hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took
me away to 'Frisco. Frank wouldn't throw up his hand, though; so
he followed me there, and he saw me without pa knowing anything
about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just
fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and
make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had
as much as pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of
time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived.
'Why shouldn't we be married right away, then,' said he, 'and
then I will feel sure of you; and I won't claim to be your
husband until I come back?' Well, we talked it over, and he had
fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting,
that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek
his fortune, and I went back to pa.

"The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then
he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New
Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a
miners' camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was
my Frank's name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was
very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took
me to half the doctors in 'Frisco. Not a word of news came for a
year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really
dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to 'Frisco, and we came to London,
and a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased, but I felt
all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place
in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.

"Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I'd have done
my duty by him. We can't command our love, but we can our
actions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to make
him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may
imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I
glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the
first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked
again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as
if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I
didn't drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the
words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my
ear. I didn't know what to do. Should I stop the service and make
a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to
know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to
tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper,
and I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on
the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the
note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a
line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so.
Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now
to him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.

"When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California,
and had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but
to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to
have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before
his mother and all those great people. I just made up my mind to
run away and explain afterwards. I hadn't been at the table ten
minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of
the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park.
I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman
came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to
me--seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little
secret of his own before marriage also--but I managed to get away
from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and
away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and
that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank
had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to
'Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to
England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the
very morning of my second wedding."

"I saw it in a paper," explained the American. "It gave the name
and the church but not where the lady lived."

"Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all
for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I
should like to vanish away and never see any of them again--just
sending a line to pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It
was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting
round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So
Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of
them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away
somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we
should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good
gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how
he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very
clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and
that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so
secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord
St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at
once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if
I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very
meanly of me."

Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but
had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this
long narrative.

"Excuse me," he said, "but it is not my custom to discuss my most
intimate personal affairs in this public manner."

"Then you won't forgive me? You won't shake hands before I go?"

"Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure." He put out
his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.

"I had hoped," suggested Holmes, "that you would have joined us
in a friendly supper."

"I think that there you ask a little too much," responded his
Lordship. "I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent
developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over
them. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a
very good-night." He included us all in a sweeping bow and
stalked out of the room.

"Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your
company," said Sherlock Holmes. "It is always a joy to meet an
American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the
folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone
years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens
of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a
quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes."

"The case has been an interesting one," remarked Holmes when our
visitors had left us, "because it serves to show very clearly how
simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight
seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural
than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing
stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr.
Lestrade of Scotland Yard."

"You were not yourself at fault at all, then?"

"From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that
the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony,
the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of
returning home. Obviously something had occurred during the
morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that
something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was
out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she
seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America
because she had spent so short a time in this country that she
could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence
over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change
her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a
process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an
American. Then who could this American be, and why should he
possess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might
be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in
rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got
before I ever heard Lord St. Simon's narrative. When he told us
of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride's manner, of so
transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a
bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very
significant allusion to claim-jumping--which in miners' parlance
means taking possession of that which another person has a prior
claim to--the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had
gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a
previous husband--the chances being in favour of the latter."

"And how in the world did you find them?"

"It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held
information in his hands the value of which he did not himself
know. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance,
but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had
settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels."

"How did you deduce the select?"

"By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence
for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive
hotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate.
In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I
learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an
American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking
over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I
had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded
to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate
enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them
some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be
better in every way that they should make their position a little
clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in
particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I
made him keep the appointment."

"But with no very good result," I remarked. "His conduct was
certainly not very gracious."

"Ah, Watson," said Holmes, smiling, "perhaps you would not be
very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and
wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of
fortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully
and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in
the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for
the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away
these bleak autumnal evenings."



XI. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET

"Holmes," said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking
down the street, "here is a madman coming along. It seems rather
sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone."

My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands
in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It
was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day
before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the
wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed
into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and
on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as
when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but
was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer
passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the
Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman
whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.

He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a
massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was
dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining
hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet
his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress
and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little
springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to
set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and
down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most
extraordinary contortions.

"What on earth can be the matter with him?" I asked. "He is
looking up at the numbers of the houses."

"I believe that he is coming here," said Holmes, rubbing his
hands.

"Here?"

"Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I
think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?" As
he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and
pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the
clanging.

A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still
gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in
his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and
pity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his
body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the
extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his
feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we
both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room.
Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting
beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy,
soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.

"You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?" said he.
"You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have
recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into
any little problem which you may submit to me."

The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting
against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his
brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.

"No doubt you think me mad?" said he.

"I see that you have had some great trouble," responded Holmes.

"God knows I have!--a trouble which is enough to unseat my
reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might
have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet
borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man;
but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have
been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone.
The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found
out of this horrible affair."

"Pray compose yourself, sir," said Holmes, "and let me have a
clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen
you."

"My name," answered our visitor, "is probably familiar to your
ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder &
Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street."

The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior
partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City
of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the
foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We
waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced
himself to tell his story.

"I feel that time is of value," said he; "that is why I hastened
here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure
your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and
hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this
snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who
takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the
facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.

"It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking
business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative
investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection
and the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means
of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security
is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction
during the last few years, and there are many noble families to
whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their
pictures, libraries, or plate.

"Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a
card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I
saw the name, for it was that of none other than--well, perhaps
even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name
which is a household word all over the earth--one of the highest,
noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the
honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged
at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry
quickly through a disagreeable task.

"'Mr. Holder,' said he, 'I have been informed that you are in the
habit of advancing money.'

"'The firm does so when the security is good.' I answered.

"'It is absolutely essential to me,' said he, 'that I should have
50,000 pounds at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a
sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it
a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my
position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place
one's self under obligations.'

"'For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?' I asked.

"'Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most
certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you
think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the
money should be paid at once.'

"'I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my
own private purse,' said I, 'were it not that the strain would be
rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do
it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must
insist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution
should be taken.'

"'I should much prefer to have it so,' said he, raising up a
square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair.
'You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?'

"'One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,'
said I.

"'Precisely.' He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft,
flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery
which he had named. 'There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,' said
he, 'and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The
lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the
sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my
security.'

"I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some
perplexity from it to my illustrious client.

"'You doubt its value?' he asked.

"'Not at all. I only doubt--'

"'The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest
about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely
certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a
pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?'

"'Ample.'

"'You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof
of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I
have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to
refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to
preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I
need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any
harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as
serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the
world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them.
I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall
call for it in person on Monday morning.'

"Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but,
calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty 1000
pound notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the
precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not
but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility
which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it
was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any
misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever
consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter
the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned
once more to my work.

"When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave
so precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers' safes had
been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how
terrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I
determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always
carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might
never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a
cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel
with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs
and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.

"And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to
thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep
out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three
maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose
absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy
Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few
months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has
always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has
attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place.
That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we
believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.

"So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it
will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an
only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr.
Holmes--a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am
myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very
likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I
had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a
moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it
would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I
meant it for the best.

"It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my
business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild,
wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the
handling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a
member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming
manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long
purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards
and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again
to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his
allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried
more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he
was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir
George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.

"And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George
Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently
brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could
hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than
Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been
everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of
great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far
away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his
cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that
he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so,
too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman's quick insight into
character.

"And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but
when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the
world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my
daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house--sweet, loving, beautiful,
a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and
gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know
what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone
against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for
he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I
think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it
would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his
whole life; but now, alas! it is too late--forever too late!

"Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and
I shall continue with my miserable story.

"When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after
dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious
treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name
of my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am
sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed.
Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous
coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.

"'Where have you put it?' asked Arthur.

"'In my own bureau.'

"'Well, I hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during the
night.' said he.

"'It is locked up,' I answered.

"'Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I
have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.'

"He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of
what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with
a very grave face.

"'Look here, dad,' said he with his eyes cast down, 'can you let
me have 200 pounds?'

"'No, I cannot!' I answered sharply. 'I have been far too
generous with you in money matters.'

"'You have been very kind,' said he, 'but I must have this money,
or else I can never show my face inside the club again.'

"'And a very good thing, too!' I cried.

"'Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,'
said he. 'I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money
in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try
other means.'

"I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the
month. 'You shall not have a farthing from me,' I cried, on which
he bowed and left the room without another word.

"When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my
treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go
round the house to see that all was secure--a duty which I
usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform
myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself
at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as
I approached.

"'Tell me, dad,' said she, looking, I thought, a little
disturbed, 'did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out
to-night?'

"'Certainly not.'

"'She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she
has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that
it is hardly safe and should be stopped.'

"'You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer
it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?'

"'Quite sure, dad.'

"'Then, good-night.' I kissed her and went up to my bedroom
again, where I was soon asleep.

"I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may
have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question
me upon any point which I do not make clear."

"On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid."

"I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be
particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety
in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual.
About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in
the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an
impression behind it as though a window had gently closed
somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my
horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in
the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear,
and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.

"'Arthur!' I screamed, 'you villain! you thief! How dare you
touch that coronet?'

"The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy,
dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the
light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be
wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry
he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I
snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with
three of the beryls in it, was missing.

"'You blackguard!' I shouted, beside myself with rage. 'You have
destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the
jewels which you have stolen?'

"'Stolen!' he cried.

"'Yes, thief!' I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.

"'There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,' said he.

"'There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I
call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to
tear off another piece?'

"'You have called me names enough,' said he, 'I will not stand it
any longer. I shall not say another word about this business,
since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in
the morning and make my own way in the world.'

"'You shall leave it in the hands of the police!' I cried
half-mad with grief and rage. 'I shall have this matter probed to
the bottom.'

"'You shall learn nothing from me,' said he with a passion such
as I should not have thought was in his nature. 'If you choose to
call the police, let the police find what they can.'

"By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my
voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and,
at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur's face, she read the
whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the
ground. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the
investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a
constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with
his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge
him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private
matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was
national property. I was determined that the law should have its
way in everything.

"'At least,' said he, 'you will not have me arrested at once. It
would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the
house for five minutes.'

"'That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you
have stolen,' said I. And then, realising the dreadful position
in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only
my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at
stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would
convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell
me what he had done with the three missing stones.

"'You may as well face the matter,' said I; 'you have been caught
in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous.
If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling
us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.'

"'Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,' he answered,
turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened
for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for
it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search
was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of
every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed
the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the
wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our
threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after
going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to
you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter.
The police have openly confessed that they can at present make
nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think
necessary. I have already offered a reward of 1000 pounds. My
God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son
in one night. Oh, what shall I do!"

He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to
and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got
beyond words.

Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows
knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.

"Do you receive much company?" he asked.

"None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of
Arthur's. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No
one else, I think."

"Do you go out much in society?"

"Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for
it."

"That is unusual in a young girl."

"She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She
is four-and-twenty."

"This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to
her also."

"Terrible! She is even more affected than I."

"You have neither of you any doubt as to your son's guilt?"

"How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet
in his hands."

"I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of
the coronet at all injured?"

"Yes, it was twisted."

"Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to
straighten it?"

"God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me.
But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If
his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?"

"Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie?
His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several
singular points about the case. What did the police think of the
noise which awoke you from your sleep?"

"They considered that it might be caused by Arthur's closing his
bedroom door."

"A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door
so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the
disappearance of these gems?"

"They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture
in the hope of finding them."

"Have they thought of looking outside the house?"

"Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has
already been minutely examined."

"Now, my dear sir," said Holmes. "is it not obvious to you now
that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you
or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you
to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider
what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came
down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room,
opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main
force a small portion of it, went off to some other place,
concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that
nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six
into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger
of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?"

"But what other is there?" cried the banker with a gesture of
despair. "If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain
them?"

"It is our task to find that out," replied Holmes; "so now, if
you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together,
and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into
details."

My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition,
which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy
were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I
confess that the guilt of the banker's son appeared to me to be
as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such
faith in Holmes' judgment that I felt that there must be some
grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted
explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the
southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his
hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client
appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope
which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a
desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway
journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest
residence of the great financier.

Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing
back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a
snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates
which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden
thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges
stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the
tradesmen's entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the
stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a
public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing
at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the
front, down the tradesmen's path, and so round by the garden
behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I
went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should
return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and
a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height,
slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against
the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever
seen such deadly paleness in a woman's face. Her lips, too, were
bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept
silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of
grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the
more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong
character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding
my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand
over his head with a sweet womanly caress.

"You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you
not, dad?" she asked.

"No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom."

"But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman's
instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will
be sorry for having acted so harshly."

"Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?"

"Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should
suspect him."

"How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with
the coronet in his hand?"

"Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take
my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say
no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in
prison!"

"I shall never let it drop until the gems are found--never, Mary!
Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences
to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman
down from London to inquire more deeply into it."

"This gentleman?" she asked, facing round to me.

"No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in
the stable lane now."

"The stable lane?" She raised her dark eyebrows. "What can he
hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir,
that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth,
that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime."

"I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may
prove it," returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the
snow from his shoes. "I believe I have the honour of addressing
Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?"

"Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up."

"You heard nothing yourself last night?"

"Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard
that, and I came down."

"You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you
fasten all the windows?"

"Yes."

"Were they all fastened this morning?"

"Yes."

"You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked
to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?"

"Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and
who may have heard uncle's remarks about the coronet."

"I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her
sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery."

"But what is the good of all these vague theories," cried the
banker impatiently, "when I have told you that I saw Arthur with
the coronet in his hands?"

"Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this
girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I
presume?"

"Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I
met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom."

"Do you know him?"

"Oh, yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round.
His name is Francis Prosper."

"He stood," said Holmes, "to the left of the door--that is to
say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?"

"Yes, he did."

"And he is a man with a wooden leg?"

Something like fear sprang up in the young lady's expressive
black eyes. "Why, you are like a magician," said she. "How do you
know that?" She smiled, but there was no answering smile in
Holmes' thin, eager face.

"I should be very glad now to go upstairs," said he. "I shall
probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps
I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up."

He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at
the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane.
This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill
with his powerful magnifying lens. "Now we shall go upstairs,"
said he at last.

The banker's dressing-room was a plainly furnished little
chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror.
Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.

"Which key was used to open it?" he asked.

"That which my son himself indicated--that of the cupboard of the
lumber-room."

"Have you it here?"

"That is it on the dressing-table."

Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.

"It is a noiseless lock," said he. "It is no wonder that it did
not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must
have a look at it." He opened the case, and taking out the diadem
he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the
jeweller's art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I
have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge,
where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.

"Now, Mr. Holder," said Holmes, "here is the corner which
corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I
beg that you will break it off."

The banker recoiled in horror. "I should not dream of trying,"
said he.

"Then I will." Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but
without result. "I feel it give a little," said he; "but, though
I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my
time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do
you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would
be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this
happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard
nothing of it?"

"I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me."

"But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think,
Miss Holder?"

"I confess that I still share my uncle's perplexity."

"Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?"

"He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt."

"Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary
luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault
if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your
permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations
outside."

He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any
unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an
hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet
heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.

"I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr.
Holder," said he; "I can serve you best by returning to my
rooms."

"But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?"

"I cannot tell."

The banker wrung his hands. "I shall never see them again!" he
cried. "And my son? You give me hopes?"

"My opinion is in no way altered."

"Then, for God's sake, what was this dark business which was
acted in my house last night?"

"If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow
morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to
make it clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to
act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you
place no limit on the sum I may draw."

"I would give my fortune to have them back."

"Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then.
Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here
again before evening."

It was obvious to me that my companion's mind was now made up
about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than
I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward
journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always
glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in
despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our
rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in
a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned
up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he
was a perfect sample of the class.

"I think that this should do," said he, glancing into the glass
above the fireplace. "I only wish that you could come with me,
Watson, but I fear that it won't do. I may be on the trail in
this matter, or I may be following a will-o'-the-wisp, but I
shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few
hours." He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard,
sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this
rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.

I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in
excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his
hand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a
cup of tea.

"I only looked in as I passed," said he. "I am going right on."

"Where to?"

"Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time
before I get back. Don't wait up for me in case I should be
late."

"How are you getting on?"

"Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham
since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a
very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a
good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get
these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly
respectable self."

I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for
satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled,
and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He
hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of
the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his
congenial hunt.

I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so
I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away
for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that
his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he
came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there
he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the
other, as fresh and trim as possible.

"You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson," said he, "but
you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this
morning."

"Why, it is after nine now," I answered. "I should not be
surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring."

It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the
change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally
of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in,
while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered
with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than
his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into
the armchair which I pushed forward for him.

"I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried," said
he. "Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without
a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured
age. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece,
Mary, has deserted me."

"Deserted you?"

"Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was
empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to
her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had
married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was
thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers
in this note:

"'MY DEAREST UNCLE:--I feel that I have brought trouble upon you,
and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune
might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my
mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must
leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is
provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will
be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in       
death, I am ever your loving,--MARY.'

"What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it
points to suicide?"

"No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible
solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of
your troubles."

"Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have
learned something! Where are the gems?"

"You would not think 1000 pounds apiece an excessive sum for
them?"

"I would pay ten."

"That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter.
And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book?
Here is a pen. Better make it out for 4000 pounds."

With a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes
walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of
gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.

With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.

"You have it!" he gasped. "I am saved! I am saved!"

The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and
he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.

"There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder," said Sherlock
Holmes rather sternly.

"Owe!" He caught up a pen. "Name the sum, and I will pay it."

"No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that
noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I
should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to
have one."

"Then it was not Arthur who took them?"

"I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not."

"You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him
know that the truth is known."

"He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an
interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the
story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was
right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite
clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his
lips."

"For heaven's sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary
mystery!"

"I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached
it. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me
to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding
between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now
fled together."

"My Mary? Impossible!"

"It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither
you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you
admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most
dangerous men in England--a ruined gambler, an absolutely
desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece
knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he
had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she
alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said,
but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing
him nearly every evening."

"I cannot, and I will not, believe it!" cried the banker with an
ashen face.

"I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night.
Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room,
slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which
leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right
through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the
coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he
bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but
there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all
other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had
hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming
downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you
about one of the servants' escapade with her wooden-legged lover,
which was all perfectly true.

"Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but
he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts.
In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door,
so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin
walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared
into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad
slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what
would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the
room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw
that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed
down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and
slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see
what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the
window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then
closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close
to where he stood hid behind the curtain.

"As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action
without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the
instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune
this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it
right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened
the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane,
where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George
Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was
a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the
coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son
struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something
suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet
in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your
room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in
the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you
appeared upon the scene."

"Is it possible?" gasped the banker.

"You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when
he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not
explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who
certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He
took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her
secret."

"And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the
coronet," cried Mr. Holder. "Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have
been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes!
The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the
scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!"

"When I arrived at the house," continued Holmes, "I at once went
very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in
the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since
the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost
to preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen's path, but
found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it,
however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood
and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed
that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been
disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was
shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had
waited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time
that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had
already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed
round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks,
which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable
lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in
front of me.

"There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second
double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked
feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the
latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the
other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over
the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed
after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the
hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while
waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred
yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round,
where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle,
and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me
that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and
another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been
hurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that
the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.

"On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the
sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could
at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the
outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming
in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what
had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had
brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had
pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged
at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which
neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the
prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So
far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who
was it brought him the coronet?

"It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the
impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the
truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down,
so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were
the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in
their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his
cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should
retain her secret--the more so as the secret was a disgraceful
one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and
how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture
became a certainty.

"And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently,
for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must
feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your
circle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir
George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil
reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots
and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur
had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was
safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his
own family.

"Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took
next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George's house,
managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that
his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at
the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of
his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and
saw that they exactly fitted the tracks."

"I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,"
said Mr. Holder.

"Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home
and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to
play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert
scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our
hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of
course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every
particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a
life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I
clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he
became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give
him a price for the stones he held--1000 pounds apiece. That
brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. 'Why,
dash it all!' said he, 'I've let them go at six hundred for the
three!' I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had
them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I
set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at 1000
pounds apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all
was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o'clock, after
what I may call a really hard day's work."

"A day which has saved England from a great public scandal," said
the banker, rising. "Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but
you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your
skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I
must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I
have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my
very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now."

"I think that we may safely say," returned Holmes, "that she is
wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that
whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than
sufficient punishment."



XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES

"To the man who loves art for its own sake," remarked Sherlock
Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily
Telegraph, "it is frequently in its least important and lowliest
manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is
pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped
this truth that in these little records of our cases which you
have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say,
occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much
to the many causes cï¿½lï¿½bres and sensational trials in which I
have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been
trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those
faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made
my special province."

"And yet," said I, smiling, "I cannot quite hold myself absolved
from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my
records."

"You have erred, perhaps," he observed, taking up a glowing
cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood
pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a
disputatious rather than a meditative mood--"you have erred
perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your
statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing
upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is
really the only notable feature about the thing."

"It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,"
I remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism
which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my
friend's singular character.

"No, it is not selfishness or conceit," said he, answering, as
was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. "If I claim full
justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing--a
thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it
is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should
dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of
lectures into a series of tales."

It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after
breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at
Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of
dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark,
shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit
and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for
the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been
silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the
advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last,
having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very
sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.

"At the same time," he remarked after a pause, during which he
had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire,
"you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of
these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself
in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense,
at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King
of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the
problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the
incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are
outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I
fear that you may have bordered on the trivial."

"The end may have been so," I answered, "but the methods I hold
to have been novel and of interest."

"Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant
public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a
compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of
analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial. I cannot
blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at
least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As
to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an
agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to
young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched
bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my
zero-point, I fancy. Read it!" He tossed a crumpled letter across
to me.

It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and
ran thus:

"DEAR MR. HOLMES:--I am very anxious to consult you as to whether
I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered
to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I
do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,
                                               "VIOLET HUNTER."

"Do you know the young lady?" I asked.

"Not I."

"It is half-past ten now."

"Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring."

"It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You
remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to
be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation.
It may be so in this case, also."

"Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved,
for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question."

As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room.
She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face,
freckled like a plover's egg, and with the brisk manner of a
woman who has had her own way to make in the world.

"You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure," said she, as my
companion rose to greet her, "but I have had a very strange
experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort
from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be
kind enough to tell me what I should do."

"Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything
that I can to serve you."

I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner
and speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching
fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and
his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.

"I have been a governess for five years," said she, "in the
family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel
received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his
children over to America with him, so that I found myself without
a situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but
without success. At last the little money which I had saved began
to run short, and I was at my wit's end as to what I should do.

"There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End
called Westaway's, and there I used to call about once a week in
order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me.
Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is
really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office,
and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom,
and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers
and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.

"Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office
as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A
prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy
chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at
her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very
earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a
jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.

"'That will do,' said he; 'I could not ask for anything better.
Capital! capital!' He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his
hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a
comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at
him.

"'You are looking for a situation, miss?' he asked.

"'Yes, sir.'

"'As governess?'

"'Yes, sir.'

"'And what salary do you ask?'

"'I had 4 pounds a month in my last place with Colonel Spence
Munro.'

"'Oh, tut, tut! sweating--rank sweating!' he cried, throwing his
fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling
passion. 'How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with
such attractions and accomplishments?'

"'My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,' said I.
'A little French, a little German, music, and drawing--'

"'Tut, tut!' he cried. 'This is all quite beside the question.
The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment
of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are
not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a
considerable part in the history of the country. But if you have
why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to
accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me,
madam, would commence at 100 pounds a year.'

"You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was,
such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman,
however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face,
opened a pocket-book and took out a note.

"'It is also my custom,' said he, smiling in the most pleasant
fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid
the white creases of his face, 'to advance to my young ladies
half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little
expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.'

"It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so
thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the
advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something
unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know
a little more before I quite committed myself.

"'May I ask where you live, sir?' said I.

"'Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles
on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my
dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.'

"'And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would
be.'

"'One child--one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if
you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack!
smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!' He leaned back
in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.

"I was a little startled at the nature of the child's amusement,
but the father's laughter made me think that perhaps he was
joking.

"'My sole duties, then,' I asked, 'are to take charge of a single
child?'

"'No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,' he
cried. 'Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would
suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided
always that they were such commands as a lady might with
propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?'

"'I should be happy to make myself useful.'

"'Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you
know--faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress
which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim.
Heh?'

"'No,' said I, considerably astonished at his words.

"'Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to
you?'

"'Oh, no.'

"'Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?'

"I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes,
my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of
chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of
sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.

"'I am afraid that that is quite impossible,' said I. He had been
watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a
shadow pass over his face as I spoke.

"'I am afraid that it is quite essential,' said he. 'It is a
little fancy of my wife's, and ladies' fancies, you know, madam,
ladies' fancies must be consulted. And so you won't cut your
hair?'

"'No, sir, I really could not,' I answered firmly.

"'Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a
pity, because in other respects you would really have done very
nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more
of your young ladies.'

"The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers
without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so
much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting
that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.

"'Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?' she asked.

"'If you please, Miss Stoper.'

"'Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the
most excellent offers in this fashion,' said she sharply. 'You
can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such
opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.' She struck a gong
upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.

"Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found
little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the
table. I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very
foolish thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and
expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were
at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few
governesses in England are getting 100 pounds a year. Besides,
what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing
it short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was
inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after
I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go
back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open
when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it
here and I will read it to you:

                       "'The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.
"'DEAR MISS HUNTER:--Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your
address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have
reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you
should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of
you. We are willing to give 30 pounds a quarter, or 120 pounds a
year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which
our fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My
wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would
like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need
not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one
belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which
would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting
here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that
need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no
doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty
during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain
firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary
may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child
is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall
meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train.
Yours faithfully, JEPHRO RUCASTLE.'

"That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and
my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however,
that before taking the final step I should like to submit the
whole matter to your consideration."

"Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the
question," said Holmes, smiling.

"But you would not advise me to refuse?"

"I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to
see a sister of mine apply for."

"What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?"

"Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself
formed some opinion?"

"Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr.
Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not
possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the
matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that
he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an
outbreak?"

"That is a possible solution--in fact, as matters stand, it is
the most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a
nice household for a young lady."

"But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!"

"Well, yes, of course the pay is good--too good. That is what
makes me uneasy. Why should they give you 120 pounds a year, when
they could have their pick for 40 pounds? There must be some
strong reason behind."

"I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would
understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so
much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me."

"Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that
your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has
come my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel
about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt
or in danger--"

"Danger! What danger do you foresee?"

Holmes shook his head gravely. "It would cease to be a danger if
we could define it," said he. "But at any time, day or night, a
telegram would bring me down to your help."

"That is enough." She rose briskly from her chair with the
anxiety all swept from her face. "I shall go down to Hampshire
quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once,
sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester
to-morrow." With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both
good-night and bustled off upon her way.

"At least," said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending
the stairs, "she seems to be a young lady who is very well able
to take care of herself."

"And she would need to be," said Holmes gravely. "I am much
mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past."

It was not very long before my friend's prediction was fulfilled.
A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts
turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of
human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual
salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to
something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether
the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond
my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat
frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an
abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his
hand when I mentioned it. "Data! data! data!" he cried
impatiently. "I can't make bricks without clay." And yet he would
always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever
have accepted such a situation.

The telegram which we eventually received came late one night
just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down
to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently
indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a
test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came
down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope,
and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.

"Just look up the trains in Bradshaw," said he, and turned back
to his chemical studies.

The summons was a brief and urgent one.

"Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday
to-morrow," it said. "Do come! I am at my wit's end.  HUNTER."

"Will you come with me?" asked Holmes, glancing up.

"I should wish to."

"Just look it up, then."

"There is a train at half-past nine," said I, glancing over my
Bradshaw. "It is due at Winchester at 11:30."

"That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my
analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the
morning."

By eleven o'clock the next day we were well upon our way to the
old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers
all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he
threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal
spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white
clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining
very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air,
which set an edge to a man's energy. All over the countryside,
away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and
grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light
green of the new foliage.

"Are they not fresh and beautiful?" I cried with all the
enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.

But Holmes shook his head gravely.

"Do you know, Watson," said he, "that it is one of the curses of
a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with
reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered
houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them,
and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their
isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed
there."

"Good heavens!" I cried. "Who would associate crime with these
dear old homesteads?"

"They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief,
Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest
alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin
than does the smiling and beautiful countryside."

"You horrify me!"

"But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion
can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no
lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of
a drunkard's blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among
the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever
so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is
but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these
lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part
with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the
deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on,
year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this
lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I
should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of
country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is
not personally threatened."

"No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away."

"Quite so. She has her freedom."

"What CAN be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?"

"I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would
cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is
correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we
shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of
the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has
to tell."

The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no
distance from the station, and there we found the young lady
waiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch
awaited us upon the table.

"I am so delighted that you have come," she said earnestly. "It
is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I
should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me."

"Pray tell us what has happened to you."

"I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr.
Rucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into
town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose."

"Let us have everything in its due order." Holmes thrust his long
thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.

"In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole,
with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is
only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and
I am not easy in my mind about them."

"What can you not understand?"

"Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just
as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and
drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he
said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself,
for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all
stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds
round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which
slopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about
a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs
to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord
Southerton's preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in
front of the hall door has given its name to the place.

"I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever,
and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child.
There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to
us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is
not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much
younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think,
while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their
conversation I have gathered that they have been married about
seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by
the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr.
Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them
was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As
the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite
imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her
father's young wife.

"Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as
in feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse.
She was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately
devoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey
eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every
little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her
also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they
seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow,
this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the
saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her
in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of
her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so
utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small
for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large.
His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between
savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving
pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea
of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning
the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would
rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he
has little to do with my story."

"I am glad of all details," remarked my friend, "whether they
seem to you to be relevant or not."

"I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one
unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was
the appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a
man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough,
uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual
smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been
quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it.
His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as
silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most
unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the
nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one
corner of the building.

"For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was
very quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after
breakfast and whispered something to her husband.

"'Oh, yes,' said he, turning to me, 'we are very much obliged to
you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut
your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest
iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue
dress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in
your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should
both be extremely obliged.'

"The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade
of blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it
bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not
have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr.
and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which
seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for
me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching
along the entire front of the house, with three long windows
reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the
central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was
asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the
other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest
stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how
comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs.
Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so
much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad,
anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle
suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the
day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in
the nursery.

"Two days later this same performance was gone through under
exactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I
sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny
stories of which my employer had an immense rï¿½pertoire, and which
he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and
moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not
fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for
about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then
suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and
to change my dress.

"You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to
what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly
be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face
away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire
to see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be
impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been
broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of
the glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst
of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able
with a little management to see all that there was behind me. I
confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that
was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I
perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road,
a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in
my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are
usually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the
railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I
lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her
eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing,
but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my
hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.

"'Jephro,' said she, 'there is an impertinent fellow upon the
road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.'

"'No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?' he asked.

"'No, I know no one in these parts.'

"'Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to
him to go away.'

"'Surely it would be better to take no notice.'

"'No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn
round and wave him away like that.'

"I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew
down the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have
not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor
seen the man in the road."

"Pray continue," said Holmes. "Your narrative promises to be a
most interesting one."

"You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may
prove to be little relation between the different incidents of
which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper
Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands
near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp
rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving
about.

"'Look in here!' said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two
planks. 'Is he not a beauty?'

"I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a
vague figure huddled up in the darkness.

"'Don't be frightened,' said my employer, laughing at the start
which I had given. 'It's only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine,
but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do
anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then,
so that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose
every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs
upon. For goodness' sake don't you ever on any pretext set your
foot over the threshold at night, for it's as much as your life
is worth.'

"The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to
look out of my bedroom window about two o'clock in the morning.
It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the
house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was
standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was
aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper
beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It
was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging
jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly
across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side.
That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not
think that any burglar could have done.

"And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as
you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a
great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the
child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the
furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things.
There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones
empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two
with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was
naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It
struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight,
so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very
first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There
was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never
guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.

"I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint,
and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing
obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in
the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the
contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two
tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was
it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at
all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer,
and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that
I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had
locked.

"I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes,
and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head.
There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited
at all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of
the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked.
One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle
coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on
his face which made him a very different person to the round,
jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his
brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his
temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me
without a word or a look.

"This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the
grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I
could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four
of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the
fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I
strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle
came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.

"'Ah!' said he, 'you must not think me rude if I passed you
without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with
business matters.'

"I assured him that I was not offended. 'By the way,' said I,
'you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one
of them has the shutters up.'

"He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled
at my remark.

"'Photography is one of my hobbies,' said he. 'I have made my
dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we
have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever
believed it?' He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest
in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and
annoyance, but no jest.

"Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there
was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know,
I was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity,
though I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty--a
feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this
place. They talk of woman's instinct; perhaps it was woman's
instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there,
and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the
forbidden door.

"It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that,
besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to
do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large
black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been
drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when
I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at
all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both
downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an
admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock,
opened the door, and slipped through.

"There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and
uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end.
Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third
of which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and
cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so
thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through
them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it
had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked
at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with
stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was
not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the
shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from
beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was
a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the
passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it
might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room
and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little
slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad,
unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My
overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran--ran
as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the
skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door,
and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting
outside.

"'So,' said he, smiling, 'it was you, then. I thought that it
must be when I saw the door open.'

"'Oh, I am so frightened!' I panted.

"'My dear young lady! my dear young lady!'--you cannot think how
caressing and soothing his manner was--'and what has frightened
you, my dear young lady?'

"But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I
was keenly on my guard against him.

"'I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,' I answered.
'But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was
frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in
there!'

"'Only that?' said he, looking at me keenly.

"'Why, what did you think?' I asked.

"'Why do you think that I lock this door?'

"'I am sure that I do not know.'

"'It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you
see?' He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.

"'I am sure if I had known--'

"'Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over
that threshold again'--here in an instant the smile hardened into
a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a
demon--'I'll throw you to the mastiff.'

"I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that
I must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing
until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I
thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without
some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the
woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible
to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of
course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was
almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would
send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the
office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then
returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my
mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I
remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of
insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one
in the household who had any influence with the savage creature,
or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and
lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you.
I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this
morning, but I must be back before three o'clock, for Mr. and
Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the
evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you
all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you
could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should
do."

Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story.
My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in
his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon
his face.

"Is Toller still drunk?" he asked.

"Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do
nothing with him."

"That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?"

"Yes."

"Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?"

"Yes, the wine-cellar."

"You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very
brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could
perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not
think you a quite exceptional woman."

"I will try. What is it?"

"We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o'clock, my friend
and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will,
we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might
give the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some
errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate
matters immensely."

"I will do it."

"Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of
course there is only one feasible explanation. You have been
brought there to personate someone, and the real person is
imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this
prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice
Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to
America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height,
figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very
possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of
course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you
came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some
friend of hers--possibly her fiancï¿½--and no doubt, as you wore
the girl's dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your
laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture,
that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer
desired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent
him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly
clear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of
the child."

"What on earth has that to do with it?" I ejaculated.

"My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining
light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the
parents. Don't you see that the converse is equally valid. I have
frequently gained my first real insight into the character of
parents by studying their children. This child's disposition is
abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty's sake, and whether he
derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or
from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their
power."

"I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes," cried our client. "A
thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you
have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to
this poor creature."

"We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning
man. We can do nothing until seven o'clock. At that hour we shall
be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the
mystery."

We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we
reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside
public-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining
like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were
sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been
standing smiling on the door-step.

"Have you managed it?" asked Holmes.

A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. "That is
Mrs. Toller in the cellar," said she. "Her husband lies snoring
on the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates
of Mr. Rucastle's."

"You have done well indeed!" cried Holmes with enthusiasm. "Now
lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black
business."

We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a
passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss
Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the
transverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but
without success. No sound came from within, and at the silence
Holmes' face clouded over.

"I trust that we are not too late," said he. "I think, Miss
Hunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put
your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our
way in."

It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united
strength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There
was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a
basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner
gone.

"There has been some villainy here," said Holmes; "this beauty
has guessed Miss Hunter's intentions and has carried his victim
off."

"But how?"

"Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it." He
swung himself up onto the roof. "Ah, yes," he cried, "here's the
end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did
it."

"But it is impossible," said Miss Hunter; "the ladder was not
there when the Rucastles went away."

"He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and
dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were
he whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it
would be as well for you to have your pistol ready."

The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at
the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy
stick in his hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the
wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and
confronted him.

"You villain!" said he, "where's your daughter?"

The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open
skylight.

"It is for me to ask you that," he shrieked, "you thieves! Spies
and thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I'll
serve you!" He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he
could go.

"He's gone for the dog!" cried Miss Hunter.

"I have my revolver," said I.

"Better close the front door," cried Holmes, and we all rushed
down the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we
heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a
horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An
elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out
at a side door.

"My God!" he cried. "Someone has loosed the dog. It's not been
fed for two days. Quick, quick, or it'll be too late!"

Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with
Toller hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its
black muzzle buried in Rucastle's throat, while he writhed and
screamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and
it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great
creases of his neck. With much labour we separated them and
carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid
him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered
Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to
relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him when the door
opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.

"Mrs. Toller!" cried Miss Hunter.

"Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he
went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn't let me know
what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains
were wasted."

"Ha!" said Holmes, looking keenly at her. "It is clear that Mrs.
Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else."

"Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know."

"Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several
points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark."

"I will soon make it clear to you," said she; "and I'd have done
so before now if I could ha' got out from the cellar. If there's
police-court business over this, you'll remember that I was the
one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice's friend
too.

"She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn't, from the time
that her father married again. She was slighted like and had no
say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until
after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend's house. As well as I could
learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so
quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them
but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle's hands. He knew he was
safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming
forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then
her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to
sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use
her money. When she wouldn't do it, he kept on worrying her until
she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death's door. Then
she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her
beautiful hair cut off; but that didn't make no change in her
young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be."

"Ah," said Holmes, "I think that what you have been good enough
to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce
all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this
system of imprisonment?"

"Yes, sir."

"And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of
the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler."

"That was it, sir."

"But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should
be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain
arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your
interests were the same as his."

"Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman," said
Mrs. Toller serenely.

"And in this way he managed that your good man should have no
want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment
when your master had gone out."

"You have it, sir, just as it happened."

"I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller," said Holmes, "for
you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And
here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think,
Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester,
as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a
questionable one."

And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the
copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but
was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of
his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who
probably know so much of Rucastle's past life that he finds it
difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were
married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their
flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in
the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend
Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further
interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one
of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at
Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.

Wuthering Heights


Emily Bronte




CHAPTER I


1801.--I have just returned from a visit to my landlord--the solitary
neighbour that I shall be troubled with.  This is certainly a beautiful
country!  In all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a
situation so completely removed from the stir of society.  A perfect
misanthropist's heaven: and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair
to divide the desolation between us.  A capital fellow!  He little
imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes
withdraw so suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up, and when his
fingers sheltered themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further in
his waistcoat, as I announced my name.

'Mr. Heathcliff?' I said.

A nod was the answer.

'Mr. Lockwood, your new tenant, sir.  I do myself the honour of calling
as soon as possible after my arrival, to express the hope that I have not
inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of
Thrushcross Grange: I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts--'

'Thrushcross Grange is my own, sir,' he interrupted, wincing.  'I should
not allow any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder it--walk in!'

The 'walk in' was uttered with closed teeth, and expressed the sentiment,
'Go to the Deuce:' even the gate over which he leant manifested no
sympathising movement to the words; and I think that circumstance
determined me to accept the invitation: I felt interested in a man who
seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself.

When he saw my horse's breast fairly pushing the barrier, he did put out
his hand to unchain it, and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway,
calling, as we entered the court,--'Joseph, take Mr. Lockwood's horse;
and bring up some wine.'

'Here we have the whole establishment of domestics, I suppose,' was the
reflection suggested by this compound order.  'No wonder the grass grows
up between the flags, and cattle are the only hedge-cutters.'

Joseph was an elderly, nay, an old man: very old, perhaps, though hale
and sinewy.  'The Lord help us!' he soliloquised in an undertone of
peevish displeasure, while relieving me of my horse: looking, meantime,
in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of
divine aid to digest his dinner, and his pious ejaculation had no
reference to my unexpected advent.

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff's dwelling.  'Wuthering'
being a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the atmospheric
tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather.  Pure, bracing
ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed: one may guess
the power of the north wind blowing over the edge, by the excessive slant
of a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and by a range of gaunt
thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if craving alms of the sun.
Happily, the architect had foresight to build it strong: the narrow
windows are deeply set in the wall, and the corners defended with large
jutting stones.

Before passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque
carving lavished over the front, and especially about the principal door;
above which, among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless
little boys, I detected the date '1500,' and the name 'Hareton Earnshaw.'
I would have made a few comments, and requested a short history of the
place from the surly owner; but his attitude at the door appeared to
demand my speedy entrance, or complete departure, and I had no desire to
aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium.

One stop brought us into the family sitting-room, without any
introductory lobby or passage: they call it here 'the house'
pre-eminently.  It includes kitchen and parlour, generally; but I believe
at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into
another quarter: at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues, and a
clatter of culinary utensils, deep within; and I observed no signs of
roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge fireplace; nor any glitter
of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls.  One end, indeed,
reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter
dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and tankards, towering row after
row, on a vast oak dresser, to the very roof.  The latter had never been
under-drawn: its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye, except
where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef,
mutton, and ham, concealed it.  Above the chimney were sundry villainous
old guns, and a couple of horse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three
gaudily-painted canisters disposed along its ledge.  The floor was of
smooth, white stone; the chairs, high-backed, primitive structures,
painted green: one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade.  In an
arch under the dresser reposed a huge, liver-coloured bitch pointer,
surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies; and other dogs haunted other
recesses.

The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as
belonging to a homely, northern farmer, with a stubborn countenance, and
stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee-breeches and gaiters.  Such
an individual seated in his arm-chair, his mug of ale frothing on the
round table before him, is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles
among these hills, if you go at the right time after dinner.  But Mr.
Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living.  He
is a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect, in dress and manners a gentleman: that
is, as much a gentleman as many a country squire: rather slovenly,
perhaps, yet not looking amiss with his negligence, because he has an
erect and handsome figure; and rather morose.  Possibly, some people
might suspect him of a degree of under-bred pride; I have a sympathetic
chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort: I know, by
instinct, his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of
feeling--to manifestations of mutual kindliness.  He'll love and hate
equally under cover, and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved
or hated again.  No, I'm running on too fast: I bestow my own attributes
over-liberally on him.  Mr. Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar
reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a would-be
acquaintance, to those which actuate me.  Let me hope my constitution is
almost peculiar: my dear mother used to say I should never have a
comfortable home; and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy
of one.

While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea-coast, I was thrown
into the company of a most fascinating creature: a real goddess in my
eyes, as long as she took no notice of me.  I 'never told my love'
vocally; still, if looks have language, the merest idiot might have
guessed I was over head and ears: she understood me at last, and looked a
return--the sweetest of all imaginable looks.  And what did I do?  I
confess it with shame--shrunk icily into myself, like a snail; at every
glance retired colder and farther; till finally the poor innocent was led
to doubt her own senses, and, overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed
mistake, persuaded her mamma to decamp.  By this curious turn of
disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness; how
undeserved, I alone can appreciate.

I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which
my landlord advanced, and filled up an interval of silence by attempting
to caress the canine mother, who had left her nursery, and was sneaking
wolfishly to the back of my legs, her lip curled up, and her white teeth
watering for a snatch.  My caress provoked a long, guttural gnarl.

'You'd better let the dog alone,' growled Mr. Heathcliff in unison,
checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot.  'She's not
accustomed to be spoiled--not kept for a pet.'  Then, striding to a side
door, he shouted again, 'Joseph!'

Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar, but gave no
intimation of ascending; so his master dived down to him, leaving me
_vis-a-vis_ the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheep-dogs,
who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not
anxious to come in contact with their fangs, I sat still; but, imagining
they would scarcely understand tacit insults, I unfortunately indulged
in winking and making faces at the trio, and some turn of my physiognomy
so irritated madam, that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my
knees. I flung her back, and hastened to interpose the table between us.
This proceeding aroused the whole hive: half-a-dozen four-footed fiends,
of various sizes and ages, issued from hidden dens to the common centre.
I felt my heels and coat-laps peculiar subjects of assault; and parrying
off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker, I
was constrained to demand, aloud, assistance from some of the household
in re-establishing peace.

Mr. Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious
phlegm: I don't think they moved one second faster than usual, though
the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily, an
inhabitant of the kitchen made more despatch: a lusty dame, with
tucked-up gown, bare arms, and fire-flushed cheeks, rushed into the
midst of us flourishing a frying-pan: and used that weapon, and her
tongue, to such purpose, that the storm subsided magically, and she only
remained, heaving like a sea after a high wind, when her master entered
on the scene.

'What the devil is the matter?' he asked, eyeing me in a manner that I
could ill endure, after this inhospitable treatment.

'What the devil, indeed!' I muttered.  'The herd of possessed swine could
have had no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours, sir.  You
might as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers!'

'They won't meddle with persons who touch nothing,' he remarked, putting
the bottle before me, and restoring the displaced table.  'The dogs do
right to be vigilant.  Take a glass of wine?'

'No, thank you.'

'Not bitten, are you?'

'If I had been, I would have set my signet on the biter.'  Heathcliff's
countenance relaxed into a grin.

'Come, come,' he said, 'you are flurried, Mr. Lockwood.  Here, take a
little wine.  Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my
dogs, I am willing to own, hardly know how to receive them.  Your health,
sir?'

I bowed and returned the pledge; beginning to perceive that it would be
foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs; besides, I
felt loth to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense; since his
humour took that turn.  He--probably swayed by prudential consideration
of the folly of offending a good tenant--relaxed a little in the laconic
style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs, and introduced
what he supposed would be a subject of interest to me,--a discourse on
the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement.  I
found him very intelligent on the topics we touched; and before I went
home, I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit to-morrow.  He
evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion.  I shall go,
notwithstanding.  It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself compared
with him.




CHAPTER II


Yesterday afternoon set in misty and cold.  I had half a mind to spend it
by my study fire, instead of wading through heath and mud to Wuthering
Heights.  On coming up from dinner, however, (N.B.--I dine between twelve
and one o'clock; the housekeeper, a matronly lady, taken as a fixture
along with the house, could not, or would not, comprehend my request that
I might be served at five)--on mounting the stairs with this lazy
intention, and stepping into the room, I saw a servant-girl on her knees
surrounded by brushes and coal-scuttles, and raising an infernal dust as
she extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders.  This spectacle drove
me back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a four-miles' walk,
arrived at Heathcliff's garden-gate just in time to escape the first
feathery flakes of a snow-shower.

On that bleak hill-top the earth was hard with a black frost, and the air
made me shiver through every limb.  Being unable to remove the chain, I
jumped over, and, running up the flagged causeway bordered with
straggling gooseberry-bushes, knocked vainly for admittance, till my
knuckles tingled and the dogs howled.

'Wretched inmates!' I ejaculated, mentally, 'you deserve perpetual
isolation from your species for your churlish inhospitality. At least, I
would not keep my doors barred in the day-time. I don't care--I will get
in!' So resolved, I grasped the latch and shook it vehemently.
Vinegar-faced Joseph projected his head from a round window of the barn.

'What are ye for?' he shouted.  'T' maister's down i' t' fowld.  Go round
by th' end o' t' laith, if ye went to spake to him.'

'Is there nobody inside to open the door?' I hallooed, responsively.

'There's nobbut t' missis; and shoo'll not oppen 't an ye mak' yer
flaysome dins till neeght.'

'Why?  Cannot you tell her whom I am, eh, Joseph?'

'Nor-ne me!  I'll hae no hend wi't,' muttered the head, vanishing.

The snow began to drive thickly.  I seized the handle to essay another
trial; when a young man without coat, and shouldering a pitchfork,
appeared in the yard behind.  He hailed me to follow him, and, after
marching through a wash-house, and a paved area containing a coal-shed,
pump, and pigeon-cot, we at length arrived in the huge, warm, cheerful
apartment where I was formerly received.  It glowed delightfully in the
radiance of an immense fire, compounded of coal, peat, and wood; and near
the table, laid for a plentiful evening meal, I was pleased to observe
the 'missis,' an individual whose existence I had never previously
suspected.  I bowed and waited, thinking she would bid me take a seat.
She looked at me, leaning back in her chair, and remained motionless and
mute.

'Rough weather!' I remarked.  'I'm afraid, Mrs. Heathcliff, the door must
bear the consequence of your servants' leisure attendance: I had hard
work to make them hear me.'

She never opened her mouth.  I stared--she stared also: at any rate, she
kept her eyes on me in a cool, regardless manner, exceedingly
embarrassing and disagreeable.

'Sit down,' said the young man, gruffly.  'He'll be in soon.'

I obeyed; and hemmed, and called the villain Juno, who deigned, at this
second interview, to move the extreme tip of her tail, in token of owning
my acquaintance.

'A beautiful animal!' I commenced again.  'Do you intend parting with the
little ones, madam?'

'They are not mine,' said the amiable hostess, more repellingly than
Heathcliff himself could have replied.

'Ah, your favourites are among these?' I continued, turning to an obscure
cushion full of something like cats.

'A strange choice of favourites!' she observed scornfully.

Unluckily, it was a heap of dead rabbits.  I hemmed once more, and drew
closer to the hearth, repeating my comment on the wildness of the
evening.

'You should not have come out,' she said, rising and reaching from the
chimney-piece two of the painted canisters.

Her position before was sheltered from the light; now, I had a distinct
view of her whole figure and countenance.  She was slender, and
apparently scarcely past girlhood: an admirable form, and the most
exquisite little face that I have ever had the pleasure of beholding;
small features, very fair; flaxen ringlets, or rather golden, hanging
loose on her delicate neck; and eyes, had they been agreeable in
expression, that would have been irresistible: fortunately for my
susceptible heart, the only sentiment they evinced hovered between scorn
and a kind of desperation, singularly unnatural to be detected there.  The
canisters were almost out of her reach; I made a motion to aid her; she
turned upon me as a miser might turn if any one attempted to assist him
in counting his gold.

'I don't want your help,' she snapped; 'I can get them for myself.'

'I beg your pardon!' I hastened to reply.

'Were you asked to tea?' she demanded, tying an apron over her neat black
frock, and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the pot.

'I shall be glad to have a cup,' I answered.

'Were you asked?' she repeated.

'No,' I said, half smiling.  'You are the proper person to ask me.'

She flung the tea back, spoon and all, and resumed her chair in a pet;
her forehead corrugated, and her red under-lip pushed out, like a child's
ready to cry.

Meanwhile, the young man had slung on to his person a decidedly shabby
upper garment, and, erecting himself before the blaze, looked down on me
from the corner of his eyes, for all the world as if there were some
mortal feud unavenged between us.  I began to doubt whether he were a
servant or not: his dress and speech were both rude, entirely devoid of
the superiority observable in Mr. and Mrs. Heathcliff; his thick brown
curls were rough and uncultivated, his whiskers encroached bearishly over
his cheeks, and his hands were embrowned like those of a common labourer:
still his bearing was free, almost haughty, and he showed none of a
domestic's assiduity in attending on the lady of the house.  In the
absence of clear proofs of his condition, I deemed it best to abstain
from noticing his curious conduct; and, five minutes afterwards, the
entrance of Heathcliff relieved me, in some measure, from my
uncomfortable state.

'You see, sir, I am come, according to promise!' I exclaimed, assuming
the cheerful; 'and I fear I shall be weather-bound for half an hour, if
you can afford me shelter during that space.'

'Half an hour?' he said, shaking the white flakes from his clothes; 'I
wonder you should select the thick of a snow-storm to ramble about in.  Do
you know that you run a risk of being lost in the marshes?  People
familiar with these moors often miss their road on such evenings; and I
can tell you there is no chance of a change at present.'

'Perhaps I can get a guide among your lads, and he might stay at the
Grange till morning--could you spare me one?'

'No, I could not.'

'Oh, indeed!  Well, then, I must trust to my own sagacity.'

'Umph!'

'Are you going to mak' the tea?' demanded he of the shabby coat, shifting
his ferocious gaze from me to the young lady.

'Is _he_ to have any?' she asked, appealing to Heathcliff.

'Get it ready, will you?' was the answer, uttered so savagely that I
started.  The tone in which the words were said revealed a genuine bad
nature.  I no longer felt inclined to call Heathcliff a capital fellow.
When the preparations were finished, he invited me with--'Now, sir, bring
forward your chair.'  And we all, including the rustic youth, drew round
the table: an austere silence prevailing while we discussed our meal.

I thought, if I had caused the cloud, it was my duty to make an effort to
dispel it.  They could not every day sit so grim and taciturn; and it was
impossible, however ill-tempered they might be, that the universal scowl
they wore was their every-day countenance.

'It is strange,' I began, in the interval of swallowing one cup of tea
and receiving another--'it is strange how custom can mould our tastes and
ideas: many could not imagine the existence of happiness in a life of
such complete exile from the world as you spend, Mr. Heathcliff; yet,
I'll venture to say, that, surrounded by your family, and with your
amiable lady as the presiding genius over your home and heart--'

'My amiable lady!' he interrupted, with an almost diabolical sneer on his
face.  'Where is she--my amiable lady?'

'Mrs. Heathcliff, your wife, I mean.'

'Well, yes--oh, you would intimate that her spirit has taken the post of
ministering angel, and guards the fortunes of Wuthering Heights, even
when her body is gone.  Is that it?'

Perceiving myself in a blunder, I attempted to correct it.  I might have
seen there was too great a disparity between the ages of the parties to
make it likely that they were man and wife.  One was about forty: a
period of mental vigour at which men seldom cherish the delusion of being
married for love by girls: that dream is reserved for the solace of our
declining years.  The other did not look seventeen.

Then it flashed upon me--'The clown at my elbow, who is drinking his tea
out of a basin and eating his bread with unwashed hands, may be her
husband: Heathcliff junior, of course.  Here is the consequence of being
buried alive: she has thrown herself away upon that boor from sheer
ignorance that better individuals existed!  A sad pity--I must beware how
I cause her to regret her choice.'  The last reflection may seem
conceited; it was not.  My neighbour struck me as bordering on repulsive;
I knew, through experience, that I was tolerably attractive.

'Mrs. Heathcliff is my daughter-in-law,' said Heathcliff, corroborating
my surmise.  He turned, as he spoke, a peculiar look in her direction: a
look of hatred; unless he has a most perverse set of facial muscles that
will not, like those of other people, interpret the language of his soul.

'Ah, certainly--I see now: you are the favoured possessor of the
beneficent fairy,' I remarked, turning to my neighbour.

This was worse than before: the youth grew crimson, and clenched his
fist, with every appearance of a meditated assault.  But he seemed to
recollect himself presently, and smothered the storm in a brutal curse,
muttered on my behalf: which, however, I took care not to notice.

'Unhappy in your conjectures, sir,' observed my host; 'we neither of us
have the privilege of owning your good fairy; her mate is dead.  I said
she was my daughter-in-law: therefore, she must have married my son.'

'And this young man is--'

'Not my son, assuredly.'

Heathcliff smiled again, as if it were rather too bold a jest to
attribute the paternity of that bear to him.

'My name is Hareton Earnshaw,' growled the other; 'and I'd counsel you to
respect it!'

'I've shown no disrespect,' was my reply, laughing internally at the
dignity with which he announced himself.

He fixed his eye on me longer than I cared to return the stare, for fear
I might be tempted either to box his ears or render my hilarity audible.
I began to feel unmistakably out of place in that pleasant family circle.
The dismal spiritual atmosphere overcame, and more than neutralised, the
glowing physical comforts round me; and I resolved to be cautious how I
ventured under those rafters a third time.

The business of eating being concluded, and no one uttering a word of
sociable conversation, I approached a window to examine the weather.  A
sorrowful sight I saw: dark night coming down prematurely, and sky and
hills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind and suffocating snow.

'I don't think it possible for me to get home now without a guide,' I
could not help exclaiming.  'The roads will be buried already; and, if
they were bare, I could scarcely distinguish a foot in advance.'

'Hareton, drive those dozen sheep into the barn porch.  They'll be
covered if left in the fold all night: and put a plank before them,' said
Heathcliff.

'How must I do?' I continued, with rising irritation.

There was no reply to my question; and on looking round I saw only Joseph
bringing in a pail of porridge for the dogs, and Mrs. Heathcliff leaning
over the fire, diverting herself with burning a bundle of matches which
had fallen from the chimney-piece as she restored the tea-canister to its
place.  The former, when he had deposited his burden, took a critical
survey of the room, and in cracked tones grated out--'Aw wonder how yah
can faishion to stand thear i' idleness un war, when all on 'ems goan
out!  Bud yah're a nowt, and it's no use talking--yah'll niver mend o'yer
ill ways, but goa raight to t' divil, like yer mother afore ye!'

I imagined, for a moment, that this piece of eloquence was addressed to
me; and, sufficiently enraged, stepped towards the aged rascal with an
intention of kicking him out of the door.  Mrs. Heathcliff, however,
checked me by her answer.

'You scandalous old hypocrite!' she replied.  'Are you not afraid of
being carried away bodily, whenever you mention the devil's name?  I warn
you to refrain from provoking me, or I'll ask your abduction as a special
favour!  Stop! look here, Joseph,' she continued, taking a long, dark
book from a shelf; 'I'll show you how far I've progressed in the Black
Art: I shall soon be competent to make a clear house of it.  The red cow
didn't die by chance; and your rheumatism can hardly be reckoned among
providential visitations!'

'Oh, wicked, wicked!' gasped the elder; 'may the Lord deliver us from
evil!'

'No, reprobate! you are a castaway--be off, or I'll hurt you seriously!
I'll have you all modelled in wax and clay! and the first who passes the
limits I fix shall--I'll not say what he shall be done to--but, you'll
see!  Go, I'm looking at you!'

The little witch put a mock malignity into her beautiful eyes, and
Joseph, trembling with sincere horror, hurried out, praying, and
ejaculating 'wicked' as he went.  I thought her conduct must be prompted
by a species of dreary fun; and, now that we were alone, I endeavoured to
interest her in my distress.

'Mrs. Heathcliff,' I said earnestly, 'you must excuse me for troubling
you.  I presume, because, with that face, I'm sure you cannot help being
good-hearted.  Do point out some landmarks by which I may know my way
home: I have no more idea how to get there than you would have how to get
to London!'

'Take the road you came,' she answered, ensconcing herself in a chair,
with a candle, and the long book open before her.  'It is brief advice,
but as sound as I can give.'

'Then, if you hear of me being discovered dead in a bog or a pit full of
snow, your conscience won't whisper that it is partly your fault?'

'How so?  I cannot escort you.  They wouldn't let me go to the end of the
garden wall.'

'_You_!  I should be sorry to ask you to cross the threshold, for my
convenience, on such a night,' I cried.  'I want you to tell me my way,
not to _show_ it: or else to persuade Mr. Heathcliff to give me a guide.'

'Who?  There is himself, Earnshaw, Zillah, Joseph and I.  Which would you
have?'

'Are there no boys at the farm?'

'No; those are all.'

'Then, it follows that I am compelled to stay.'

'That you may settle with your host.  I have nothing to do with it.'

'I hope it will be a lesson to you to make no more rash journeys on these
hills,' cried Heathcliff's stern voice from the kitchen entrance.  'As to
staying here, I don't keep accommodations for visitors: you must share a
bed with Hareton or Joseph, if you do.'

'I can sleep on a chair in this room,' I replied.

'No, no!  A stranger is a stranger, be he rich or poor: it will not suit
me to permit any one the range of the place while I am off guard!' said
the unmannerly wretch.

With this insult my patience was at an end.  I uttered an expression of
disgust, and pushed past him into the yard, running against Earnshaw in
my haste.  It was so dark that I could not see the means of exit; and, as
I wandered round, I heard another specimen of their civil behaviour
amongst each other.  At first the young man appeared about to befriend
me.

'I'll go with him as far as the park,' he said.

'You'll go with him to hell!' exclaimed his master, or whatever relation
he bore.  'And who is to look after the horses, eh?'

'A man's life is of more consequence than one evening's neglect of the
horses: somebody must go,' murmured Mrs. Heathcliff, more kindly than I
expected.

'Not at your command!' retorted Hareton.  'If you set store on him, you'd
better be quiet.'

'Then I hope his ghost will haunt you; and I hope Mr. Heathcliff will
never get another tenant till the Grange is a ruin,' she answered,
sharply.

'Hearken, hearken, shoo's cursing on 'em!' muttered Joseph, towards whom
I had been steering.

He sat within earshot, milking the cows by the light of a lantern, which
I seized unceremoniously, and, calling out that I would send it back on
the morrow, rushed to the nearest postern.

'Maister, maister, he's staling t' lanthern!' shouted the ancient,
pursuing my retreat.  'Hey, Gnasher!  Hey, dog!  Hey Wolf, holld him,
holld him!'

On opening the little door, two hairy monsters flew at my throat, bearing
me down, and extinguishing the light; while a mingled guffaw from
Heathcliff and Hareton put the copestone on my rage and humiliation.
Fortunately, the beasts seemed more bent on stretching their paws, and
yawning, and flourishing their tails, than devouring me alive; but they
would suffer no resurrection, and I was forced to lie till their
malignant masters pleased to deliver me: then, hatless and trembling with
wrath, I ordered the miscreants to let me out--on their peril to keep me
one minute longer--with several incoherent threats of retaliation that,
in their indefinite depth of virulency, smacked of King Lear.

The vehemence of my agitation brought on a copious bleeding at the nose,
and still Heathcliff laughed, and still I scolded.  I don't know what
would have concluded the scene, had there not been one person at hand
rather more rational than myself, and more benevolent than my
entertainer.  This was Zillah, the stout housewife; who at length issued
forth to inquire into the nature of the uproar.  She thought that some of
them had been laying violent hands on me; and, not daring to attack her
master, she turned her vocal artillery against the younger scoundrel.

'Well, Mr. Earnshaw,' she cried, 'I wonder what you'll have agait next?
Are we going to murder folk on our very door-stones?  I see this house
will never do for me--look at t' poor lad, he's fair choking!  Wisht,
wisht; you mun'n't go on so.  Come in, and I'll cure that: there now,
hold ye still.'

With these words she suddenly splashed a pint of icy water down my neck,
and pulled me into the kitchen.  Mr. Heathcliff followed, his accidental
merriment expiring quickly in his habitual moroseness.

I was sick exceedingly, and dizzy, and faint; and thus compelled perforce
to accept lodgings under his roof.  He told Zillah to give me a glass of
brandy, and then passed on to the inner room; while she condoled with me
on my sorry predicament, and having obeyed his orders, whereby I was
somewhat revived, ushered me to bed.




CHAPTER III


While leading the way upstairs, she recommended that I should hide the
candle, and not make a noise; for her master had an odd notion about the
chamber she would put me in, and never let anybody lodge there willingly.
I asked the reason.  She did not know, she answered: she had only lived
there a year or two; and they had so many queer goings on, she could not
begin to be curious.

Too stupefied to be curious myself, I fastened my door and glanced round
for the bed.  The whole furniture consisted of a chair, a clothes-press,
and a large oak case, with squares cut out near the top resembling coach
windows.  Having approached this structure, I looked inside, and
perceived it to be a singular sort of old-fashioned couch, very
conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the
family having a room to himself.  In fact, it formed a little closet, and
the ledge of a window, which it enclosed, served as a table.  I slid back
the panelled sides, got in with my light, pulled them together again, and
felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff, and every one else.

The ledge, where I placed my candle, had a few mildewed books piled up in
one corner; and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint.  This
writing, however, was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of
characters, large and small--_Catherine Earnshaw_, here and there varied
to _Catherine Heathcliff_, and then again to _Catherine Linton_.

In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window, and continued
spelling over Catherine Earnshaw--Heathcliff--Linton, till my eyes
closed; but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white
letters started from the dark, as vivid as spectres--the air swarmed with
Catherines; and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name, I discovered
my candle-wick reclining on one of the antique volumes, and perfuming the
place with an odour of roasted calf-skin.  I snuffed it off, and, very
ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea, sat up and
spread open the injured tome on my knee.  It was a Testament, in lean
type, and smelling dreadfully musty: a fly-leaf bore the
inscription--'Catherine Earnshaw, her book,' and a date some quarter of a
century back.  I shut it, and took up another and another, till I had
examined all.  Catherine's library was select, and its state of
dilapidation proved it to have been well used, though not altogether for
a legitimate purpose: scarcely one chapter had escaped, a pen-and-ink
commentary--at least the appearance of one--covering every morsel of
blank that the printer had left.  Some were detached sentences; other
parts took the form of a regular diary, scrawled in an unformed, childish
hand.  At the top of an extra page (quite a treasure, probably, when
first lighted on) I was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature
of my friend Joseph,--rudely, yet powerfully sketched.  An immediate
interest kindled within me for the unknown Catherine, and I began
forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics.

'An awful Sunday,' commenced the paragraph beneath.  'I wish my father
were back again.  Hindley is a detestable substitute--his conduct to
Heathcliff is atrocious--H. and I are going to rebel--we took our
initiatory step this evening.

'All day had been flooding with rain; we could not go to church, so
Joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret; and, while Hindley
and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable fire--doing anything
but reading their Bibles, I'll answer for it--Heathcliff, myself, and the
unhappy ploughboy were commanded to take our prayer-books, and mount: we
were ranged in a row, on a sack of corn, groaning and shivering, and
hoping that Joseph would shiver too, so that he might give us a short
homily for his own sake.  A vain idea!  The service lasted precisely
three hours; and yet my brother had the face to exclaim, when he saw us
descending, "What, done already?"  On Sunday evenings we used to be
permitted to play, if we did not make much noise; now a mere titter is
sufficient to send us into corners.

'"You forget you have a master here," says the tyrant.  "I'll demolish
the first who puts me out of temper!  I insist on perfect sobriety and
silence.  Oh, boy! was that you?  Frances darling, pull his hair as you
go by: I heard him snap his fingers."  Frances pulled his hair heartily,
and then went and seated herself on her husband's knee, and there they
were, like two babies, kissing and talking nonsense by the hour--foolish
palaver that we should be ashamed of.  We made ourselves as snug as our
means allowed in the arch of the dresser.  I had just fastened our
pinafores together, and hung them up for a curtain, when in comes Joseph,
on an errand from the stables.  He tears down my handiwork, boxes my
ears, and croaks:

'"T' maister nobbut just buried, and Sabbath not o'ered, und t' sound o'
t' gospel still i' yer lugs, and ye darr be laiking!  Shame on ye! sit ye
down, ill childer! there's good books eneugh if ye'll read 'em: sit ye
down, and think o' yer sowls!"

'Saying this, he compelled us so to square our positions that we might
receive from the far-off fire a dull ray to show us the text of the
lumber he thrust upon us.  I could not bear the employment.  I took my
dingy volume by the scroop, and hurled it into the dog-kennel, vowing I
hated a good book.  Heathcliff kicked his to the same place.  Then there
was a hubbub!

'"Maister Hindley!" shouted our chaplain.  "Maister, coom hither!  Miss
Cathy's riven th' back off 'Th' Helmet o' Salvation,' un' Heathcliff's
pawsed his fit into t' first part o' 'T' Brooad Way to Destruction!'  It's
fair flaysome that ye let 'em go on this gait.  Ech! th' owd man wad ha'
laced 'em properly--but he's goan!"

'Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth, and seizing one of
us by the collar, and the other by the arm, hurled both into the
back-kitchen; where, Joseph asseverated, "owd Nick" would fetch us as
sure as we were living: and, so comforted, we each sought a separate
nook to await his advent. I reached this book, and a pot of ink from a
shelf, and pushed the house-door ajar to give me light, and I have got
the time on with writing for twenty minutes; but my companion is
impatient, and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywoman's
cloak, and have a scamper on the moors, under its shelter. A pleasant
suggestion--and then, if the surly old man come in, he may believe his
prophecy verified--we cannot be damper, or colder, in the rain than we
are here.'

* * * * * *

I suppose Catherine fulfilled her project, for the next sentence took up
another subject: she waxed lachrymose.

'How little did I dream that Hindley would ever make me cry so!' she
wrote.  'My head aches, till I cannot keep it on the pillow; and still I
can't give over.  Poor Heathcliff!  Hindley calls him a vagabond, and
won't let him sit with us, nor eat with us any more; and, he says, he and
I must not play together, and threatens to turn him out of the house if
we break his orders.  He has been blaming our father (how dared he?) for
treating H. too liberally; and swears he will reduce him to his right
place--'

* * * * * *

I began to nod drowsily over the dim page: my eye wandered from
manuscript to print.  I saw a red ornamented title--'Seventy Times Seven,
and the First of the Seventy-First.  A Pious Discourse delivered by the
Reverend Jabez Branderham, in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough.'  And while
I was, half-consciously, worrying my brain to guess what Jabez Branderham
would make of his subject, I sank back in bed, and fell asleep.  Alas,
for the effects of bad tea and bad temper!  What else could it be that
made me pass such a terrible night?  I don't remember another that I can
at all compare with it since I was capable of suffering.

I began to dream, almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality.  I
thought it was morning; and I had set out on my way home, with Joseph for
a guide.  The snow lay yards deep in our road; and, as we floundered on,
my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not brought a
pilgrim's staff: telling me that I could never get into the house without
one, and boastfully flourishing a heavy-headed cudgel, which I understood
to be so denominated.  For a moment I considered it absurd that I should
need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence.  Then a new
idea flashed across me.  I was not going there: we were journeying to
hear the famous Jabez Branderham preach, from the text--'Seventy Times
Seven;' and either Joseph, the preacher, or I had committed the 'First of
the Seventy-First,' and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.

We came to the chapel.  I have passed it really in my walks, twice or
thrice; it lies in a hollow, between two hills: an elevated hollow, near
a swamp, whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of
embalming on the few corpses deposited there.  The roof has been kept
whole hitherto; but as the clergyman's stipend is only twenty pounds per
annum, and a house with two rooms, threatening speedily to determine into
one, no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor: especially as it
is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than
increase the living by one penny from their own pockets.  However, in my
dream, Jabez had a full and attentive congregation; and he preached--good
God! what a sermon; divided into _four hundred and ninety_ parts, each
fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit, and each discussing a
separate sin!  Where he searched for them, I cannot tell.  He had his
private manner of interpreting the phrase, and it seemed necessary the
brother should sin different sins on every occasion.  They were of the
most curious character: odd transgressions that I never imagined
previously.

Oh, how weary I grow.  How I writhed, and yawned, and nodded, and
revived!  How I pinched and pricked myself, and rubbed my eyes, and stood
up, and sat down again, and nudged Joseph to inform me if he would _ever_
have done.  I was condemned to hear all out: finally, he reached the
'_First of the Seventy-First_.'  At that crisis, a sudden inspiration
descended on me; I was moved to rise and denounce Jabez Branderham as the
sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.

'Sir,' I exclaimed, 'sitting here within these four walls, at one
stretch, I have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads of
your discourse.  Seventy times seven times have I plucked up my hat and
been about to depart--Seventy times seven times have you preposterously
forced me to resume my seat.  The four hundred and ninety-first is too
much.  Fellow-martyrs, have at him!  Drag him down, and crush him to
atoms, that the place which knows him may know him no more!'

'_Thou art the Man_!' cried Jabez, after a solemn pause, leaning over his
cushion.  'Seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy
visage--seventy times seven did I take counsel with my soul--Lo, this is
human weakness: this also may be absolved!  The First of the
Seventy-First is come.  Brethren, execute upon him the judgment written.
Such honour have all His saints!'

With that concluding word, the whole assembly, exalting their pilgrim's
staves, rushed round me in a body; and I, having no weapon to raise in
self-defence, commenced grappling with Joseph, my nearest and most
ferocious assailant, for his.  In the confluence of the multitude,
several clubs crossed; blows, aimed at me, fell on other sconces.
Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counter rappings:
every man's hand was against his neighbour; and Branderham, unwilling to
remain idle, poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards
of the pulpit, which responded so smartly that, at last, to my
unspeakable relief, they woke me.  And what was it that had suggested the
tremendous tumult?  What had played Jabez's part in the row?  Merely the
branch of a fir-tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by, and
rattled its dry cones against the panes!  I listened doubtingly an
instant; detected the disturber, then turned and dozed, and dreamt again:
if possible, still more disagreeably than before.

This time, I remembered I was lying in the oak closet, and I heard
distinctly the gusty wind, and the driving of the snow; I heard, also,
the fir bough repeat its teasing sound, and ascribed it to the right
cause: but it annoyed me so much, that I resolved to silence it, if
possible; and, I thought, I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement.
The hook was soldered into the staple: a circumstance observed by me when
awake, but forgotten.  'I must stop it, nevertheless!' I muttered,
knocking my knuckles through the glass, and stretching an arm out to
seize the importunate branch; instead of which, my fingers closed on the
fingers of a little, ice-cold hand!  The intense horror of nightmare came
over me: I tried to draw back my arm, but the hand clung to it, and a
most melancholy voice sobbed, 'Let me in--let me in!'  'Who are you?' I
asked, struggling, meanwhile, to disengage myself.  'Catherine Linton,'
it replied, shiveringly (why did I think of _Linton_?  I had read
_Earnshaw_ twenty times for Linton)--'I'm come home: I'd lost my way on
the moor!'  As it spoke, I discerned, obscurely, a child's face looking
through the window.  Terror made me cruel; and, finding it useless to
attempt shaking the creature off, I pulled its wrist on to the broken
pane, and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the
bedclothes: still it wailed, 'Let me in!' and maintained its tenacious
grip, almost maddening me with fear.  'How can I!' I said at length.
'Let _me_ go, if you want me to let you in!'  The fingers relaxed, I
snatched mine through the hole, hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid
against it, and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer.  I
seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour; yet, the instant I
listened again, there was the doleful cry moaning on!  'Begone!' I
shouted.  'I'll never let you in, not if you beg for twenty years.'  'It
is twenty years,' mourned the voice: 'twenty years.  I've been a waif for
twenty years!'  Thereat began a feeble scratching outside, and the pile
of books moved as if thrust forward.  I tried to jump up; but could not
stir a limb; and so yelled aloud, in a frenzy of fright.  To my
confusion, I discovered the yell was not ideal: hasty footsteps
approached my chamber door; somebody pushed it open, with a vigorous
hand, and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed.  I
sat shuddering yet, and wiping the perspiration from my forehead: the
intruder appeared to hesitate, and muttered to himself.  At last, he
said, in a half-whisper, plainly not expecting an answer, 'Is any one
here?'  I considered it best to confess my presence; for I knew
Heathcliff's accents, and feared he might search further, if I kept
quiet.  With this intention, I turned and opened the panels.  I shall not
soon forget the effect my action produced.

Heathcliff stood near the entrance, in his shirt and trousers; with a
candle dripping over his fingers, and his face as white as the wall
behind him.  The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric
shock: the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet, and his
agitation was so extreme, that he could hardly pick it up.

'It is only your guest, sir,' I called out, desirous to spare him the
humiliation of exposing his cowardice further.  'I had the misfortune to
scream in my sleep, owing to a frightful nightmare.  I'm sorry I
disturbed you.'

'Oh, God confound you, Mr. Lockwood!  I wish you were at the--' commenced
my host, setting the candle on a chair, because he found it impossible to
hold it steady.  'And who showed you up into this room?' he continued,
crushing his nails into his palms, and grinding his teeth to subdue the
maxillary convulsions.  'Who was it?  I've a good mind to turn them out
of the house this moment?'

'It was your servant Zillah,' I replied, flinging myself on to the floor,
and rapidly resuming my garments.  'I should not care if you did, Mr.
Heathcliff; she richly deserves it.  I suppose that she wanted to get
another proof that the place was haunted, at my expense.  Well, it
is--swarming with ghosts and goblins!  You have reason in shutting it up,
I assure you.  No one will thank you for a doze in such a den!'

'What do you mean?' asked Heathcliff, 'and what are you doing?  Lie down
and finish out the night, since you _are_ here; but, for heaven's sake!
don't repeat that horrid noise: nothing could excuse it, unless you were
having your throat cut!'

'If the little fiend had got in at the window, she probably would have
strangled me!' I returned.  'I'm not going to endure the persecutions of
your hospitable ancestors again.  Was not the Reverend Jabez Branderham
akin to you on the mother's side?  And that minx, Catherine Linton, or
Earnshaw, or however she was called--she must have been a
changeling--wicked little soul!  She told me she had been walking the
earth these twenty years: a just punishment for her mortal
transgressions, I've no doubt!'

Scarcely were these words uttered when I recollected the association of
Heathcliff's with Catherine's name in the book, which had completely
slipped from my memory, till thus awakened.  I blushed at my
inconsideration: but, without showing further consciousness of the
offence, I hastened to add--'The truth is, sir, I passed the first part
of the night in--'  Here I stopped afresh--I was about to say 'perusing
those old volumes,' then it would have revealed my knowledge of their
written, as well as their printed, contents; so, correcting myself, I
went on--'in spelling over the name scratched on that window-ledge.  A
monotonous occupation, calculated to set me asleep, like counting, or--'

'What _can_ you mean by talking in this way to _me_!' thundered
Heathcliff with savage vehemence.  'How--how _dare_ you, under my
roof?--God! he's mad to speak so!'  And he struck his forehead with rage.

I did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation;
but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and proceeded with
my dreams; affirming I had never heard the appellation of 'Catherine
Linton' before, but reading it often over produced an impression which
personified itself when I had no longer my imagination under control.
Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed, as I spoke;
finally sitting down almost concealed behind it.  I guessed, however, by
his irregular and intercepted breathing, that he struggled to vanquish an
excess of violent emotion.  Not liking to show him that I had heard the
conflict, I continued my toilette rather noisily, looked at my watch, and
soliloquised on the length of the night: 'Not three o'clock yet!  I could
have taken oath it had been six.  Time stagnates here: we must surely
have retired to rest at eight!'

'Always at nine in winter, and rise at four,' said my host, suppressing a
groan: and, as I fancied, by the motion of his arm's shadow, dashing a
tear from his eyes.  'Mr. Lockwood,' he added, 'you may go into my room:
you'll only be in the way, coming down-stairs so early: and your childish
outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.'

'And for me, too,' I replied.  'I'll walk in the yard till daylight, and
then I'll be off; and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion.
I'm now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society, be it country or
town.  A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.'

'Delightful company!' muttered Heathcliff.  'Take the candle, and go
where you please.  I shall join you directly.  Keep out of the yard,
though, the dogs are unchained; and the house--Juno mounts sentinel
there, and--nay, you can only ramble about the steps and passages.  But,
away with you!  I'll come in two minutes!'

I obeyed, so far as to quit the chamber; when, ignorant where the narrow
lobbies led, I stood still, and was witness, involuntarily, to a piece of
superstition on the part of my landlord which belied, oddly, his apparent
sense.  He got on to the bed, and wrenched open the lattice, bursting, as
he pulled at it, into an uncontrollable passion of tears.  'Come in! come
in!' he sobbed.  'Cathy, do come.  Oh, do--_once_ more!  Oh! my heart's
darling! hear me _this_ time, Catherine, at last!'  The spectre showed a
spectre's ordinary caprice: it gave no sign of being; but the snow and
wind whirled wildly through, even reaching my station, and blowing out
the light.

There was such anguish in the gush of grief that accompanied this raving,
that my compassion made me overlook its folly, and I drew off, half angry
to have listened at all, and vexed at having related my ridiculous
nightmare, since it produced that agony; though _why_ was beyond my
comprehension.  I descended cautiously to the lower regions, and landed
in the back-kitchen, where a gleam of fire, raked compactly together,
enabled me to rekindle my candle.  Nothing was stirring except a
brindled, grey cat, which crept from the ashes, and saluted me with a
querulous mew.

Two benches, shaped in sections of a circle, nearly enclosed the hearth;
on one of these I stretched myself, and Grimalkin mounted the other.  We
were both of us nodding ere any one invaded our retreat, and then it was
Joseph, shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof, through
a trap: the ascent to his garret, I suppose.  He cast a sinister look at
the little flame which I had enticed to play between the ribs, swept the
cat from its elevation, and bestowing himself in the vacancy, commenced
the operation of stuffing a three-inch pipe with tobacco.  My presence in
his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for
remark: he silently applied the tube to his lips, folded his arms, and
puffed away.  I let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed; and after sucking out
his last wreath, and heaving a profound sigh, he got up, and departed as
solemnly as he came.

A more elastic footstep entered next; and now I opened my mouth for a
'good-morning,' but closed it again, the salutation unachieved; for
Hareton Earnshaw was performing his orison _sotto voce_, in a series of
curses directed against every object he touched, while he rummaged a
corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts.  He glanced over
the back of the bench, dilating his nostrils, and thought as little of
exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat.  I guessed,
by his preparations, that egress was allowed, and, leaving my hard couch,
made a movement to follow him.  He noticed this, and thrust at an inner
door with the end of his spade, intimating by an inarticulate sound that
there was the place where I must go, if I changed my locality.

It opened into the house, where the females were already astir; Zillah
urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows; and Mrs.
Heathcliff, kneeling on the hearth, reading a book by the aid of the
blaze.  She held her hand interposed between the furnace-heat and her
eyes, and seemed absorbed in her occupation; desisting from it only to
chide the servant for covering her with sparks, or to push away a dog,
now and then, that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face.  I was
surprised to see Heathcliff there also.  He stood by the fire, his back
towards me, just finishing a stormy scene with poor Zillah; who ever and
anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron, and
heave an indignant groan.

'And you, you worthless--' he broke out as I entered, turning to his
daughter-in-law, and employing an epithet as harmless as duck, or sheep,
but generally represented by a dash--.  'There you are, at your idle
tricks again!  The rest of them do earn their bread--you live on my
charity!  Put your trash away, and find something to do.  You shall pay
me for the plague of having you eternally in my sight--do you hear,
damnable jade?'

'I'll put my trash away, because you can make me if I refuse,' answered
the young lady, closing her book, and throwing it on a chair.  'But I'll
not do anything, though you should swear your tongue out, except what I
please!'

Heathcliff lifted his hand, and the speaker sprang to a safer distance,
obviously acquainted with its weight.  Having no desire to be entertained
by a cat-and-dog combat, I stepped forward briskly, as if eager to
partake the warmth of the hearth, and innocent of any knowledge of the
interrupted dispute.  Each had enough decorum to suspend further
hostilities: Heathcliff placed his fists, out of temptation, in his
pockets; Mrs. Heathcliff curled her lip, and walked to a seat far off,
where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the
remainder of my stay.  That was not long.  I declined joining their
breakfast, and, at the first gleam of dawn, took an opportunity of
escaping into the free air, now clear, and still, and cold as impalpable
ice.

My landlord halloed for me to stop ere I reached the bottom of the
garden, and offered to accompany me across the moor.  It was well he did,
for the whole hill-back was one billowy, white ocean; the swells and
falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the ground:
many pits, at least, were filled to a level; and entire ranges of mounds,
the refuse of the quarries, blotted from the chart which my yesterday's
walk left pictured in my mind.  I had remarked on one side of the road,
at intervals of six or seven yards, a line of upright stones, continued
through the whole length of the barren: these were erected and daubed
with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark, and also when a
fall, like the present, confounded the deep swamps on either hand with
the firmer path: but, excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there,
all traces of their existence had vanished: and my companion found it
necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left, when I
imagined I was following, correctly, the windings of the road.

We exchanged little conversation, and he halted at the entrance of
Thrushcross Park, saying, I could make no error there.  Our adieux were
limited to a hasty bow, and then I pushed forward, trusting to my own
resources; for the porter's lodge is untenanted as yet.  The distance
from the gate to the grange is two miles; I believe I managed to make it
four, what with losing myself among the trees, and sinking up to the neck
in snow: a predicament which only those who have experienced it can
appreciate.  At any rate, whatever were my wanderings, the clock chimed
twelve as I entered the house; and that gave exactly an hour for every
mile of the usual way from Wuthering Heights.

My human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me; exclaiming,
tumultuously, they had completely given me up: everybody conjectured that
I perished last night; and they were wondering how they must set about
the search for my remains.  I bid them be quiet, now that they saw me
returned, and, benumbed to my very heart, I dragged up-stairs; whence,
after putting on dry clothes, and pacing to and fro thirty or forty
minutes, to restore the animal heat, I adjourned to my study, feeble as a
kitten: almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and smoking coffee
which the servant had prepared for my refreshment.




CHAPTER IV


What vain weathercocks we are!  I, who had determined to hold myself
independent of all social intercourse, and thanked my stars that, at
length, I had lighted on a spot where it was next to impracticable--I,
weak wretch, after maintaining till dusk a struggle with low spirits and
solitude, was finally compelled to strike my colours; and under pretence
of gaining information concerning the necessities of my establishment, I
desired Mrs. Dean, when she brought in supper, to sit down while I ate
it; hoping sincerely she would prove a regular gossip, and either rouse
me to animation or lull me to sleep by her talk.

'You have lived here a considerable time,' I commenced; 'did you not say
sixteen years?'

'Eighteen, sir: I came when the mistress was married, to wait on her;
after she died, the master retained me for his housekeeper.'

'Indeed.'

There ensued a pause.  She was not a gossip, I feared; unless about her
own affairs, and those could hardly interest me.  However, having studied
for an interval, with a fist on either knee, and a cloud of meditation
over her ruddy countenance, she ejaculated--'Ah, times are greatly
changed since then!'

'Yes,' I remarked, 'you've seen a good many alterations, I suppose?'

'I have: and troubles too,' she said.

'Oh, I'll turn the talk on my landlord's family!' I thought to myself.  'A
good subject to start!  And that pretty girl-widow, I should like to know
her history: whether she be a native of the country, or, as is more
probable, an exotic that the surly _indigenae_ will not recognise for
kin.'  With this intention I asked Mrs. Dean why Heathcliff let
Thrushcross Grange, and preferred living in a situation and residence so
much inferior.  'Is he not rich enough to keep the estate in good order?'
I inquired.

'Rich, sir!' she returned.  'He has nobody knows what money, and every
year it increases.  Yes, yes, he's rich enough to live in a finer house
than this: but he's very near--close-handed; and, if he had meant to flit
to Thrushcross Grange, as soon as he heard of a good tenant he could not
have borne to miss the chance of getting a few hundreds more.  It is
strange people should be so greedy, when they are alone in the world!'

'He had a son, it seems?'

'Yes, he had one--he is dead.'

'And that young lady, Mrs. Heathcliff, is his widow?'

'Yes.'

'Where did she come from originally?'

'Why, sir, she is my late master's daughter: Catherine Linton was her
maiden name.  I nursed her, poor thing!  I did wish Mr. Heathcliff would
remove here, and then we might have been together again.'

'What!  Catherine Linton?' I exclaimed, astonished.  But a minute's
reflection convinced me it was not my ghostly Catherine.  'Then,' I
continued, 'my predecessor's name was Linton?'

'It was.'

'And who is that Earnshaw: Hareton Earnshaw, who lives with Mr.
Heathcliff?  Are they relations?'

'No; he is the late Mrs. Linton's nephew.'

'The young lady's cousin, then?'

'Yes; and her husband was her cousin also: one on the mother's, the other
on the father's side: Heathcliff married Mr. Linton's sister.'

'I see the house at Wuthering Heights has "Earnshaw" carved over the
front door.  Are they an old family?'

'Very old, sir; and Hareton is the last of them, as our Miss Cathy is of
us--I mean, of the Lintons.  Have you been to Wuthering Heights?  I beg
pardon for asking; but I should like to hear how she is!'

'Mrs. Heathcliff? she looked very well, and very handsome; yet, I think,
not very happy.'

'Oh dear, I don't wonder!  And how did you like the master?'

'A rough fellow, rather, Mrs. Dean.  Is not that his character?

'Rough as a saw-edge, and hard as whinstone!  The less you meddle with
him the better.'

'He must have had some ups and downs in life to make him such a churl.  Do
you know anything of his history?'

'It's a cuckoo's, sir--I know all about it: except where he was born, and
who were his parents, and how he got his money at first.  And Hareton has
been cast out like an unfledged dunnock!  The unfortunate lad is the only
one in all this parish that does not guess how he has been cheated.'

'Well, Mrs. Dean, it will be a charitable deed to tell me something of my
neighbours: I feel I shall not rest if I go to bed; so be good enough to
sit and chat an hour.'

'Oh, certainly, sir!  I'll just fetch a little sewing, and then I'll sit
as long as you please.  But you've caught cold: I saw you shivering, and
you must have some gruel to drive it out.'

The worthy woman bustled off, and I crouched nearer the fire; my head
felt hot, and the rest of me chill: moreover, I was excited, almost to a
pitch of foolishness, through my nerves and brain.  This caused me to
feel, not uncomfortable, but rather fearful (as I am still) of serious
effects from the incidents of to-day and yesterday.  She returned
presently, bringing a smoking basin and a basket of work; and, having
placed the former on the hob, drew in her seat, evidently pleased to find
me so companionable.

Before I came to live here, she commenced--waiting no farther invitation
to her story--I was almost always at Wuthering Heights; because my mother
had nursed Mr. Hindley Earnshaw, that was Hareton's father, and I got
used to playing with the children: I ran errands too, and helped to make
hay, and hung about the farm ready for anything that anybody would set me
to.  One fine summer morning--it was the beginning of harvest, I
remember--Mr. Earnshaw, the old master, came down-stairs, dressed for a
journey; and, after he had told Joseph what was to be done during the
day, he turned to Hindley, and Cathy, and me--for I sat eating my
porridge with them--and he said, speaking to his son, 'Now, my bonny man,
I'm going to Liverpool to-day, what shall I bring you?  You may choose
what you like: only let it be little, for I shall walk there and back:
sixty miles each way, that is a long spell!'  Hindley named a fiddle, and
then he asked Miss Cathy; she was hardly six years old, but she could
ride any horse in the stable, and she chose a whip.  He did not forget
me; for he had a kind heart, though he was rather severe sometimes.  He
promised to bring me a pocketful of apples and pears, and then he kissed
his children, said good-bye, and set off.

It seemed a long while to us all--the three days of his absence--and
often did little Cathy ask when he would be home.  Mrs. Earnshaw expected
him by supper-time on the third evening, and she put the meal off hour
after hour; there were no signs of his coming, however, and at last the
children got tired of running down to the gate to look.  Then it grew
dark; she would have had them to bed, but they begged sadly to be allowed
to stay up; and, just about eleven o'clock, the door-latch was raised
quietly, and in stepped the master.  He threw himself into a chair,
laughing and groaning, and bid them all stand off, for he was nearly
killed--he would not have such another walk for the three kingdoms.

'And at the end of it to be flighted to death!' he said, opening his
great-coat, which he held bundled up in his arms.  'See here, wife!  I
was never so beaten with anything in my life: but you must e'en take it
as a gift of God; though it's as dark almost as if it came from the
devil.'

We crowded round, and over Miss Cathy's head I had a peep at a dirty,
ragged, black-haired child; big enough both to walk and talk: indeed, its
face looked older than Catherine's; yet when it was set on its feet, it
only stared round, and repeated over and over again some gibberish that
nobody could understand.  I was frightened, and Mrs. Earnshaw was ready
to fling it out of doors: she did fly up, asking how he could fashion to
bring that gipsy brat into the house, when they had their own bairns to
feed and fend for?  What he meant to do with it, and whether he were mad?
The master tried to explain the matter; but he was really half dead with
fatigue, and all that I could make out, amongst her scolding, was a tale
of his seeing it starving, and houseless, and as good as dumb, in the
streets of Liverpool, where he picked it up and inquired for its owner.
Not a soul knew to whom it belonged, he said; and his money and time
being both limited, he thought it better to take it home with him at
once, than run into vain expenses there: because he was determined he
would not leave it as he found it.  Well, the conclusion was, that my
mistress grumbled herself calm; and Mr. Earnshaw told me to wash it, and
give it clean things, and let it sleep with the children.

Hindley and Cathy contented themselves with looking and listening till
peace was restored: then, both began searching their father's pockets
for the presents he had promised them. The former was a boy of fourteen,
but when he drew out what had been a fiddle, crushed to morsels in the
great-coat, he blubbered aloud; and Cathy, when she learned the master
had lost her whip in attending on the stranger, showed her humour by
grinning and spitting at the stupid little thing; earning for her pains
a sound blow from her father, to teach her cleaner manners. They
entirely refused to have it in bed with them, or even in their room; and
I had no more sense, so I put it on the landing of the stairs, hoping it
might be gone on the morrow. By chance, or else attracted by hearing his
voice, it crept to Mr. Earnshaw's door, and there he found it on
quitting his chamber. Inquiries were made as to how it got there; I was
obliged to confess, and in recompense for my cowardice and inhumanity
was sent out of the house.

This was Heathcliff's first introduction to the family.  On coming back a
few days afterwards (for I did not consider my banishment perpetual), I
found they had christened him 'Heathcliff': it was the name of a son who
died in childhood, and it has served him ever since, both for Christian
and surname.  Miss Cathy and he were now very thick; but Hindley hated
him: and to say the truth I did the same; and we plagued and went on with
him shamefully: for I wasn't reasonable enough to feel my injustice, and
the mistress never put in a word on his behalf when she saw him wronged.

He seemed a sullen, patient child; hardened, perhaps, to ill-treatment:
he would stand Hindley's blows without winking or shedding a tear, and my
pinches moved him only to draw in a breath and open his eyes, as if he
had hurt himself by accident, and nobody was to blame.  This endurance
made old Earnshaw furious, when he discovered his son persecuting the
poor fatherless child, as he called him.  He took to Heathcliff
strangely, believing all he said (for that matter, he said precious
little, and generally the truth), and petting him up far above Cathy, who
was too mischievous and wayward for a favourite.

So, from the very beginning, he bred bad feeling in the house; and at
Mrs. Earnshaw's death, which happened in less than two years after, the
young master had learned to regard his father as an oppressor rather than
a friend, and Heathcliff as a usurper of his parent's affections and his
privileges; and he grew bitter with brooding over these injuries.  I
sympathised a while; but when the children fell ill of the measles, and I
had to tend them, and take on me the cares of a woman at once, I changed
my idea.  Heathcliff was dangerously sick; and while he lay at the worst
he would have me constantly by his pillow: I suppose he felt I did a good
deal for him, and he hadn't wit to guess that I was compelled to do it.
However, I will say this, he was the quietest child that ever nurse
watched over.  The difference between him and the others forced me to be
less partial.  Cathy and her brother harassed me terribly: he was as
uncomplaining as a lamb; though hardness, not gentleness, made him give
little trouble.

He got through, and the doctor affirmed it was in a great measure owing
to me, and praised me for my care.  I was vain of his commendations, and
softened towards the being by whose means I earned them, and thus Hindley
lost his last ally: still I couldn't dote on Heathcliff, and I wondered
often what my master saw to admire so much in the sullen boy; who never,
to my recollection, repaid his indulgence by any sign of gratitude.  He
was not insolent to his benefactor, he was simply insensible; though
knowing perfectly the hold he had on his heart, and conscious he had only
to speak and all the house would be obliged to bend to his wishes.  As an
instance, I remember Mr. Earnshaw once bought a couple of colts at the
parish fair, and gave the lads each one.  Heathcliff took the handsomest,
but it soon fell lame, and when he discovered it, he said to Hindley--

'You must exchange horses with me: I don't like mine; and if you won't I
shall tell your father of the three thrashings you've given me this week,
and show him my arm, which is black to the shoulder.'  Hindley put out
his tongue, and cuffed him over the ears.  'You'd better do it at once,'
he persisted, escaping to the porch (they were in the stable): 'you will
have to: and if I speak of these blows, you'll get them again with
interest.'  'Off, dog!' cried Hindley, threatening him with an iron
weight used for weighing potatoes and hay.  'Throw it,' he replied,
standing still, 'and then I'll tell how you boasted that you would turn
me out of doors as soon as he died, and see whether he will not turn you
out directly.'  Hindley threw it, hitting him on the breast, and down he
fell, but staggered up immediately, breathless and white; and, had not I
prevented it, he would have gone just so to the master, and got full
revenge by letting his condition plead for him, intimating who had caused
it.  'Take my colt, Gipsy, then!' said young Earnshaw.  'And I pray that
he may break your neck: take him, and be damned, you beggarly interloper!
and wheedle my father out of all he has: only afterwards show him what
you are, imp of Satan.--And take that, I hope he'll kick out your
brains!'

Heathcliff had gone to loose the beast, and shift it to his own stall; he
was passing behind it, when Hindley finished his speech by knocking him
under its feet, and without stopping to examine whether his hopes were
fulfilled, ran away as fast as he could.  I was surprised to witness how
coolly the child gathered himself up, and went on with his intention;
exchanging saddles and all, and then sitting down on a bundle of hay to
overcome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned, before he entered
the house.  I persuaded him easily to let me lay the blame of his bruises
on the horse: he minded little what tale was told since he had what he
wanted.  He complained so seldom, indeed, of such stirs as these, that I
really thought him not vindictive: I was deceived completely, as you will
hear.




CHAPTER V


In the course of time Mr. Earnshaw began to fail. He had been active and
healthy, yet his strength left him suddenly; and when he was confined to
the chimney-corner he grew grievously irritable. A nothing vexed him;
and suspected slights of his authority nearly threw him into fits. This
was especially to be remarked if any one attempted to impose upon, or
domineer over, his favourite: he was painfully jealous lest a word
should be spoken amiss to him; seeming to have got into his head the
notion that, because he liked Heathcliff, all hated, and longed to do
him an ill-turn. It was a disadvantage to the lad; for the kinder among
us did not wish to fret the master, so we humoured his partiality; and
that humouring was rich nourishment to the child's pride and black
tempers. Still it became in a manner necessary; twice, or thrice,
Hindley's manifestation of scorn, while his father was near, roused the
old man to a fury: he seized his stick to strike him, and shook with
rage that he could not do it.

At last, our curate (we had a curate then who made the living answer by
teaching the little Lintons and Earnshaws, and farming his bit of land
himself) advised that the young man should be sent to college; and Mr.
Earnshaw agreed, though with a heavy spirit, for he said--'Hindley was
nought, and would never thrive as where he wandered.'

I hoped heartily we should have peace now.  It hurt me to think the
master should be made uncomfortable by his own good deed.  I fancied the
discontent of age and disease arose from his family disagreements; as he
would have it that it did: really, you know, sir, it was in his sinking
frame.  We might have got on tolerably, notwithstanding, but for two
people--Miss Cathy, and Joseph, the servant: you saw him, I daresay, up
yonder.  He was, and is yet most likely, the wearisomest self-righteous
Pharisee that ever ransacked a Bible to rake the promises to himself and
fling the curses to his neighbours.  By his knack of sermonising and
pious discoursing, he contrived to make a great impression on Mr.
Earnshaw; and the more feeble the master became, the more influence he
gained.  He was relentless in worrying him about his soul's concerns, and
about ruling his children rigidly.  He encouraged him to regard Hindley
as a reprobate; and, night after night, he regularly grumbled out a long
string of tales against Heathcliff and Catherine: always minding to
flatter Earnshaw's weakness by heaping the heaviest blame on the latter.

Certainly she had ways with her such as I never saw a child take up
before; and she put all of us past our patience fifty times and oftener
in a day: from the hour she came down-stairs till the hour she went to
bed, we had not a minute's security that she wouldn't be in mischief.  Her
spirits were always at high-water mark, her tongue always going--singing,
laughing, and plaguing everybody who would not do the same.  A wild,
wicked slip she was--but she had the bonniest eye, the sweetest smile,
and lightest foot in the parish: and, after all, I believe she meant no
harm; for when once she made you cry in good earnest, it seldom happened
that she would not keep you company, and oblige you to be quiet that you
might comfort her.  She was much too fond of Heathcliff.  The greatest
punishment we could invent for her was to keep her separate from him: yet
she got chided more than any of us on his account.  In play, she liked
exceedingly to act the little mistress; using her hands freely, and
commanding her companions: she did so to me, but I would not bear
slapping and ordering; and so I let her know.

Now, Mr. Earnshaw did not understand jokes from his children: he had
always been strict and grave with them; and Catherine, on her part, had
no idea why her father should be crosser and less patient in his ailing
condition than he was in his prime.  His peevish reproofs wakened in her
a naughty delight to provoke him: she was never so happy as when we were
all scolding her at once, and she defying us with her bold, saucy look,
and her ready words; turning Joseph's religious curses into ridicule,
baiting me, and doing just what her father hated most--showing how her
pretended insolence, which he thought real, had more power over
Heathcliff than his kindness: how the boy would do _her_ bidding in
anything, and _his_ only when it suited his own inclination.  After
behaving as badly as possible all day, she sometimes came fondling to
make it up at night.  'Nay, Cathy,' the old man would say, 'I cannot love
thee, thou'rt worse than thy brother.  Go, say thy prayers, child, and
ask God's pardon.  I doubt thy mother and I must rue that we ever reared
thee!'  That made her cry, at first; and then being repulsed continually
hardened her, and she laughed if I told her to say she was sorry for her
faults, and beg to be forgiven.

But the hour came, at last, that ended Mr. Earnshaw's troubles on earth.
He died quietly in his chair one October evening, seated by the
fire-side.  A high wind blustered round the house, and roared in the
chimney: it sounded wild and stormy, yet it was not cold, and we were all
together--I, a little removed from the hearth, busy at my knitting, and
Joseph reading his Bible near the table (for the servants generally sat
in the house then, after their work was done).  Miss Cathy had been sick,
and that made her still; she leant against her father's knee, and
Heathcliff was lying on the floor with his head in her lap.  I remember
the master, before he fell into a doze, stroking her bonny hair--it
pleased him rarely to see her gentle--and saying, 'Why canst thou not
always be a good lass, Cathy?'  And she turned her face up to his, and
laughed, and answered, 'Why cannot you always be a good man, father?'  But
as soon as she saw him vexed again, she kissed his hand, and said she
would sing him to sleep.  She began singing very low, till his fingers
dropped from hers, and his head sank on his breast.  Then I told her to
hush, and not stir, for fear she should wake him.  We all kept as mute as
mice a full half-hour, and should have done so longer, only Joseph,
having finished his chapter, got up and said that he must rouse the
master for prayers and bed.  He stepped forward, and called him by name,
and touched his shoulder; but he would not move: so he took the candle
and looked at him.  I thought there was something wrong as he set down
the light; and seizing the children each by an arm, whispered them to
'frame up-stairs, and make little din--they might pray alone that
evening--he had summut to do.'

'I shall bid father good-night first,' said Catherine, putting her arms
round his neck, before we could hinder her.  The poor thing discovered
her loss directly--she screamed out--'Oh, he's dead, Heathcliff! he's
dead!'  And they both set up a heart-breaking cry.

I joined my wail to theirs, loud and bitter; but Joseph asked what we
could be thinking of to roar in that way over a saint in heaven.  He told
me to put on my cloak and run to Gimmerton for the doctor and the parson.
I could not guess the use that either would be of, then.  However, I
went, through wind and rain, and brought one, the doctor, back with me;
the other said he would come in the morning.  Leaving Joseph to explain
matters, I ran to the children's room: their door was ajar, I saw they
had never lain down, though it was past midnight; but they were calmer,
and did not need me to console them.  The little souls were comforting
each other with better thoughts than I could have hit on: no parson in
the world ever pictured heaven so beautifully as they did, in their
innocent talk; and, while I sobbed and listened, I could not help wishing
we were all there safe together.




CHAPTER VI


Mr. Hindley came home to the funeral; and--a thing that amazed us, and
set the neighbours gossiping right and left--he brought a wife with him.
What she was, and where she was born, he never informed us: probably, she
had neither money nor name to recommend her, or he would scarcely have
kept the union from his father.

She was not one that would have disturbed the house much on her own
account.  Every object she saw, the moment she crossed the threshold,
appeared to delight her; and every circumstance that took place about
her: except the preparing for the burial, and the presence of the
mourners.  I thought she was half silly, from her behaviour while that
went on: she ran into her chamber, and made me come with her, though I
should have been dressing the children: and there she sat shivering and
clasping her hands, and asking repeatedly--'Are they gone yet?'  Then she
began describing with hysterical emotion the effect it produced on her to
see black; and started, and trembled, and, at last, fell a-weeping--and
when I asked what was the matter, answered, she didn't know; but she felt
so afraid of dying!  I imagined her as little likely to die as myself.
She was rather thin, but young, and fresh-complexioned, and her eyes
sparkled as bright as diamonds.  I did remark, to be sure, that mounting
the stairs made her breathe very quick; that the least sudden noise set
her all in a quiver, and that she coughed troublesomely sometimes: but I
knew nothing of what these symptoms portended, and had no impulse to
sympathise with her.  We don't in general take to foreigners here, Mr.
Lockwood, unless they take to us first.

Young Earnshaw was altered considerably in the three years of his
absence. He had grown sparer, and lost his colour, and spoke and dressed
quite differently; and, on the very day of his return, he told Joseph
and me we must thenceforth quarter ourselves in the back-kitchen, and
leave the house for him. Indeed, he would have carpeted and papered a
small spare room for a parlour; but his wife expressed such pleasure at
the white floor and huge glowing fireplace, at the pewter dishes and
delf-case, and dog-kennel, and the wide space there was to move about in
where they usually sat, that he thought it unnecessary to her comfort,
and so dropped the intention.

She expressed pleasure, too, at finding a sister among her new
acquaintance; and she prattled to Catherine, and kissed her, and ran
about with her, and gave her quantities of presents, at the beginning.
Her affection tired very soon, however, and when she grew peevish,
Hindley became tyrannical.  A few words from her, evincing a dislike to
Heathcliff, were enough to rouse in him all his old hatred of the boy.  He
drove him from their company to the servants, deprived him of the
instructions of the curate, and insisted that he should labour out of
doors instead; compelling him to do so as hard as any other lad on the
farm.

Heathcliff bore his degradation pretty well at first, because Cathy
taught him what she learnt, and worked or played with him in the fields.
They both promised fair to grow up as rude as savages; the young master
being entirely negligent how they behaved, and what they did, so they
kept clear of him.  He would not even have seen after their going to
church on Sundays, only Joseph and the curate reprimanded his
carelessness when they absented themselves; and that reminded him to
order Heathcliff a flogging, and Catherine a fast from dinner or supper.
But it was one of their chief amusements to run away to the moors in the
morning and remain there all day, and the after punishment grew a mere
thing to laugh at.  The curate might set as many chapters as he pleased
for Catherine to get by heart, and Joseph might thrash Heathcliff till
his arm ached; they forgot everything the minute they were together
again: at least the minute they had contrived some naughty plan of
revenge; and many a time I've cried to myself to watch them growing more
reckless daily, and I not daring to speak a syllable, for fear of losing
the small power I still retained over the unfriended creatures.  One
Sunday evening, it chanced that they were banished from the sitting-room,
for making a noise, or a light offence of the kind; and when I went to
call them to supper, I could discover them nowhere.  We searched the
house, above and below, and the yard and stables; they were invisible:
and, at last, Hindley in a passion told us to bolt the doors, and swore
nobody should let them in that night.  The household went to bed; and I,
too, anxious to lie down, opened my lattice and put my head out to
hearken, though it rained: determined to admit them in spite of the
prohibition, should they return.  In a while, I distinguished steps
coming up the road, and the light of a lantern glimmered through the
gate.  I threw a shawl over my head and ran to prevent them from waking
Mr. Earnshaw by knocking.  There was Heathcliff, by himself: it gave me a
start to see him alone.

'Where is Miss Catherine?' I cried hurriedly. 'No accident, I hope?' 'At
Thrushcross Grange,' he answered; 'and I would have been there too, but
they had not the manners to ask me to stay.' 'Well, you will catch it!'
I said: 'you'll never be content till you're sent about your business.
What in the world led you wandering to Thrushcross Grange?' 'Let me get
off my wet clothes, and I'll tell you all about it, Nelly,' he replied.
I bid him beware of rousing the master, and while he undressed and I
waited to put out the candle, he continued--'Cathy and I escaped from
the wash-house to have a ramble at liberty, and getting a glimpse of the
Grange lights, we thought we would just go and see whether the Lintons
passed their Sunday evenings standing shivering in corners, while their
father and mother sat eating and drinking, and singing and laughing, and
burning their eyes out before the fire. Do you think they do? Or reading
sermons, and being catechised by their manservant, and set to learn a
column of Scripture names, if they don't answer properly?' 'Probably
not,' I responded. 'They are good children, no doubt, and don't deserve
the treatment you receive, for your bad conduct.' 'Don't cant, Nelly,'
he said: 'nonsense! We ran from the top of the Heights to the park,
without stopping--Catherine completely beaten in the race, because she
was barefoot. You'll have to seek for her shoes in the bog to-morrow. We
crept through a broken hedge, groped our way up the path, and planted
ourselves on a flower-plot under the drawing-room window. The light came
from thence; they had not put up the shutters, and the curtains were
only half closed. Both of us were able to look in by standing on the
basement, and clinging to the ledge, and we saw--ah! it was beautiful--a
splendid place carpeted with crimson, and crimson-covered chairs and
tables, and a pure white ceiling bordered by gold, a shower of
glass-drops hanging in silver chains from the centre, and shimmering
with little soft tapers. Old Mr. and Mrs. Linton were not there; Edgar
and his sisters had it entirely to themselves. Shouldn't they have been
happy? We should have thought ourselves in heaven! And now, guess what
your good children were doing? Isabella--I believe she is eleven, a year
younger than Cathy--lay screaming at the farther end of the room,
shrieking as if witches were running red-hot needles into her. Edgar
stood on the hearth weeping silently, and in the middle of the table sat
a little dog, shaking its paw and yelping; which, from their mutual
accusations, we understood they had nearly pulled in two between them.
The idiots! That was their pleasure! to quarrel who should hold a heap
of warm hair, and each begin to cry because both, after struggling to
get it, refused to take it. We laughed outright at the petted things; we
did despise them! When would you catch me wishing to have what Catherine
wanted? or find us by ourselves, seeking entertainment in yelling, and
sobbing, and rolling on the ground, divided by the whole room? I'd not
exchange, for a thousand lives, my condition here, for Edgar Linton's at
Thrushcross Grange--not if I might have the privilege of flinging Joseph
off the highest gable, and painting the house-front with Hindley's
blood!'

'Hush, hush!' I interrupted.  'Still you have not told me, Heathcliff,
how Catherine is left behind?'

'I told you we laughed,' he answered. 'The Lintons heard us, and with
one accord they shot like arrows to the door; there was silence, and
then a cry, "Oh, mamma, mamma! Oh, papa! Oh, mamma, come here. Oh, papa,
oh!" They really did howl out something in that way. We made frightful
noises to terrify them still more, and then we dropped off the ledge,
because somebody was drawing the bars, and we felt we had better flee. I
had Cathy by the hand, and was urging her on, when all at once she fell
down. "Run, Heathcliff, run!" she whispered. "They have let the bull-dog
loose, and he holds me!" The devil had seized her ankle, Nelly: I heard
his abominable snorting. She did not yell out--no! she would have
scorned to do it, if she had been spitted on the horns of a mad cow. I
did, though: I vociferated curses enough to annihilate any fiend in
Christendom; and I got a stone and thrust it between his jaws, and tried
with all my might to cram it down his throat. A beast of a servant came
up with a lantern, at last, shouting--"Keep fast, Skulker, keep fast!"
He changed his note, however, when he saw Skulker's game. The dog was
throttled off; his huge, purple tongue hanging half a foot out of his
mouth, and his pendent lips streaming with bloody slaver. The man took
Cathy up; she was sick: not from fear, I'm certain, but from pain. He
carried her in; I followed, grumbling execrations and vengeance. "What
prey, Robert?" hallooed Linton from the entrance. "Skulker has caught a
little girl, sir," he replied; "and there's a lad here," he added,
making a clutch at me, "who looks an out-and-outer! Very like the
robbers were for putting them through the window to open the doors to
the gang after all were asleep, that they might murder us at their ease.
Hold your tongue, you foul-mouthed thief, you! you shall go to the
gallows for this. Mr. Linton, sir, don't lay by your gun." "No, no,
Robert," said the old fool. "The rascals knew that yesterday was my
rent-day: they thought to have me cleverly. Come in; I'll furnish them a
reception. There, John, fasten the chain. Give Skulker some water,
Jenny. To beard a magistrate in his stronghold, and on the Sabbath, too!
Where will their insolence stop? Oh, my dear Mary, look here! Don't be
afraid, it is but a boy--yet the villain scowls so plainly in his face;
would it not be a kindness to the country to hang him at once, before he
shows his nature in acts as well as features?" He pulled me under the
chandelier, and Mrs. Linton placed her spectacles on her nose and raised
her hands in horror. The cowardly children crept nearer also, Isabella
lisping--"Frightful thing! Put him in the cellar, papa. He's exactly
like the son of the fortune-teller that stole my tame pheasant. Isn't
he, Edgar?"

'While they examined me, Cathy came round; she heard the last speech, and
laughed.  Edgar Linton, after an inquisitive stare, collected sufficient
wit to recognise her.  They see us at church, you know, though we seldom
meet them elsewhere.  "That's Miss Earnshaw?" he whispered to his mother,
"and look how Skulker has bitten her--how her foot bleeds!"

'"Miss Earnshaw?  Nonsense!" cried the dame; "Miss Earnshaw scouring the
country with a gipsy!  And yet, my dear, the child is in mourning--surely
it is--and she may be lamed for life!"

'"What culpable carelessness in her brother!" exclaimed Mr. Linton,
turning from me to Catherine.  "I've understood from Shielders"' (that
was the curate, sir) '"that he lets her grow up in absolute heathenism.
But who is this?  Where did she pick up this companion?  Oho! I declare
he is that strange acquisition my late neighbour made, in his journey to
Liverpool--a little Lascar, or an American or Spanish castaway."

'"A wicked boy, at all events," remarked the old lady, "and quite unfit
for a decent house!  Did you notice his language, Linton?  I'm shocked
that my children should have heard it."

'I recommenced cursing--don't be angry, Nelly--and so Robert was ordered
to take me off.  I refused to go without Cathy; he dragged me into the
garden, pushed the lantern into my hand, assured me that Mr. Earnshaw
should be informed of my behaviour, and, bidding me march directly,
secured the door again.  The curtains were still looped up at one corner,
and I resumed my station as spy; because, if Catherine had wished to
return, I intended shattering their great glass panes to a million of
fragments, unless they let her out.  She sat on the sofa quietly.  Mrs.
Linton took off the grey cloak of the dairy-maid which we had borrowed
for our excursion, shaking her head and expostulating with her, I
suppose: she was a young lady, and they made a distinction between her
treatment and mine.  Then the woman-servant brought a basin of warm
water, and washed her feet; and Mr. Linton mixed a tumbler of negus, and
Isabella emptied a plateful of cakes into her lap, and Edgar stood gaping
at a distance.  Afterwards, they dried and combed her beautiful hair, and
gave her a pair of enormous slippers, and wheeled her to the fire; and I
left her, as merry as she could be, dividing her food between the little
dog and Skulker, whose nose she pinched as he ate; and kindling a spark
of spirit in the vacant blue eyes of the Lintons--a dim reflection from
her own enchanting face.  I saw they were full of stupid admiration; she
is so immeasurably superior to them--to everybody on earth, is she not,
Nelly?'

'There will more come of this business than you reckon on,' I answered,
covering him up and extinguishing the light.  'You are incurable,
Heathcliff; and Mr. Hindley will have to proceed to extremities, see if
he won't.'  My words came truer than I desired.  The luckless adventure
made Earnshaw furious.  And then Mr. Linton, to mend matters, paid us a
visit himself on the morrow, and read the young master such a lecture on
the road he guided his family, that he was stirred to look about him, in
earnest.  Heathcliff received no flogging, but he was told that the first
word he spoke to Miss Catherine should ensure a dismissal; and Mrs.
Earnshaw undertook to keep her sister-in-law in due restraint when she
returned home; employing art, not force: with force she would have found
it impossible.




CHAPTER VII


Cathy stayed at Thrushcross Grange five weeks: till Christmas.  By that
time her ankle was thoroughly cured, and her manners much improved.  The
mistress visited her often in the interval, and commenced her plan of
reform by trying to raise her self-respect with fine clothes and
flattery, which she took readily; so that, instead of a wild, hatless
little savage jumping into the house, and rushing to squeeze us all
breathless, there 'lighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified
person, with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered beaver,
and a long cloth habit, which she was obliged to hold up with both hands
that she might sail in.  Hindley lifted her from her horse, exclaiming
delightedly, 'Why, Cathy, you are quite a beauty!  I should scarcely have
known you: you look like a lady now.  Isabella Linton is not to be
compared with her, is she, Frances?'  'Isabella has not her natural
advantages,' replied his wife: 'but she must mind and not grow wild again
here.  Ellen, help Miss Catherine off with her things--Stay, dear, you
will disarrange your curls--let me untie your hat.'

I removed the habit, and there shone forth beneath a grand plaid silk
frock, white trousers, and burnished shoes; and, while her eyes sparkled
joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to welcome her, she dared hardly
touch them lest they should fawn upon her splendid garments.  She kissed
me gently: I was all flour making the Christmas cake, and it would not
have done to give me a hug; and then she looked round for Heathcliff.  Mr.
and Mrs. Earnshaw watched anxiously their meeting; thinking it would
enable them to judge, in some measure, what grounds they had for hoping
to succeed in separating the two friends.

Heathcliff was hard to discover, at first.  If he were careless, and
uncared for, before Catherine's absence, he had been ten times more so
since.  Nobody but I even did him the kindness to call him a dirty boy,
and bid him wash himself, once a week; and children of his age seldom
have a natural pleasure in soap and water.  Therefore, not to mention his
clothes, which had seen three months' service in mire and dust, and his
thick uncombed hair, the surface of his face and hands was dismally
beclouded.  He might well skulk behind the settle, on beholding such a
bright, graceful damsel enter the house, instead of a rough-headed
counterpart of himself, as he expected.  'Is Heathcliff not here?' she
demanded, pulling off her gloves, and displaying fingers wonderfully
whitened with doing nothing and staying indoors.

'Heathcliff, you may come forward,' cried Mr. Hindley, enjoying his
discomfiture, and gratified to see what a forbidding young blackguard he
would be compelled to present himself.  'You may come and wish Miss
Catherine welcome, like the other servants.'

Cathy, catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment, flew to
embrace him; she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his cheek within the
second, and then stopped, and drawing back, burst into a laugh,
exclaiming, 'Why, how very black and cross you look! and how--how funny
and grim!  But that's because I'm used to Edgar and Isabella Linton.
Well, Heathcliff, have you forgotten me?'

She had some reason to put the question, for shame and pride threw double
gloom over his countenance, and kept him immovable.

'Shake hands, Heathcliff,' said Mr. Earnshaw, condescendingly; 'once in a
way that is permitted.'

'I shall not,' replied the boy, finding his tongue at last; 'I shall not
stand to be laughed at.  I shall not bear it!'  And he would have broken
from the circle, but Miss Cathy seized him again.

'I did not mean to laugh at you,' she said; 'I could not hinder myself:
Heathcliff, shake hands at least!  What are you sulky for?  It was only
that you looked odd.  If you wash your face and brush your hair, it will
be all right: but you are so dirty!'

She gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she held in her own, and also
at her dress; which she feared had gained no embellishment from its
contact with his.

'You needn't have touched me!' he answered, following her eye and
snatching away his hand.  'I shall be as dirty as I please: and I like to
be dirty, and I will be dirty.'

With that he dashed headforemost out of the room, amid the merriment of
the master and mistress, and to the serious disturbance of Catherine; who
could not comprehend how her remarks should have produced such an
exhibition of bad temper.

After playing lady's-maid to the new-comer, and putting my cakes in the
oven, and making the house and kitchen cheerful with great fires,
befitting Christmas-eve, I prepared to sit down and amuse myself by
singing carols, all alone; regardless of Joseph's affirmations that he
considered the merry tunes I chose as next door to songs.  He had retired
to private prayer in his chamber, and Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw were engaging
Missy's attention by sundry gay trifles bought for her to present to the
little Lintons, as an acknowledgment of their kindness.  They had invited
them to spend the morrow at Wuthering Heights, and the invitation had
been accepted, on one condition: Mrs. Linton begged that her darlings
might be kept carefully apart from that 'naughty swearing boy.'

Under these circumstances I remained solitary.  I smelt the rich scent of
the heating spices; and admired the shining kitchen utensils, the
polished clock, decked in holly, the silver mugs ranged on a tray ready
to be filled with mulled ale for supper; and above all, the speckless
purity of my particular care--the scoured and well-swept floor.  I gave
due inward applause to every object, and then I remembered how old
Earnshaw used to come in when all was tidied, and call me a cant lass,
and slip a shilling into my hand as a Christmas-box; and from that I went
on to think of his fondness for Heathcliff, and his dread lest he should
suffer neglect after death had removed him: and that naturally led me to
consider the poor lad's situation now, and from singing I changed my mind
to crying.  It struck me soon, however, there would be more sense in
endeavouring to repair some of his wrongs than shedding tears over them:
I got up and walked into the court to seek him.  He was not far; I found
him smoothing the glossy coat of the new pony in the stable, and feeding
the other beasts, according to custom.

'Make haste, Heathcliff!' I said, 'the kitchen is so comfortable; and
Joseph is up-stairs: make haste, and let me dress you smart before Miss
Cathy comes out, and then you can sit together, with the whole hearth to
yourselves, and have a long chatter till bedtime.'

He proceeded with his task, and never turned his head towards me.

'Come--are you coming?' I continued.  'There's a little cake for each of
you, nearly enough; and you'll need half-an-hour's donning.'

I waited five minutes, but getting no answer left him.  Catherine supped
with her brother and sister-in-law: Joseph and I joined at an unsociable
meal, seasoned with reproofs on one side and sauciness on the other.  His
cake and cheese remained on the table all night for the fairies.  He
managed to continue work till nine o'clock, and then marched dumb and
dour to his chamber.  Cathy sat up late, having a world of things to
order for the reception of her new friends: she came into the kitchen
once to speak to her old one; but he was gone, and she only stayed to ask
what was the matter with him, and then went back.  In the morning he rose
early; and, as it was a holiday, carried his ill-humour on to the moors;
not re-appearing till the family were departed for church.  Fasting and
reflection seemed to have brought him to a better spirit.  He hung about
me for a while, and having screwed up his courage, exclaimed
abruptly--'Nelly, make me decent, I'm going to be good.'

'High time, Heathcliff,' I said; 'you _have_ grieved Catherine: she's
sorry she ever came home, I daresay!  It looks as if you envied her,
because she is more thought of than you.'

The notion of _envying_ Catherine was incomprehensible to him, but the
notion of grieving her he understood clearly enough.

'Did she say she was grieved?' he inquired, looking very serious.

'She cried when I told her you were off again this morning.'

'Well, _I_ cried last night,' he returned, 'and I had more reason to cry
than she.'

'Yes: you had the reason of going to bed with a proud heart and an empty
stomach,' said I.  'Proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves.  But,
if you be ashamed of your touchiness, you must ask pardon, mind, when she
comes in.  You must go up and offer to kiss her, and say--you know best
what to say; only do it heartily, and not as if you thought her converted
into a stranger by her grand dress.  And now, though I have dinner to get
ready, I'll steal time to arrange you so that Edgar Linton shall look
quite a doll beside you: and that he does.  You are younger, and yet,
I'll be bound, you are taller and twice as broad across the shoulders;
you could knock him down in a twinkling; don't you feel that you could?'

Heathcliff's face brightened a moment; then it was overcast afresh, and
he sighed.

'But, Nelly, if I knocked him down twenty times, that wouldn't make him
less handsome or me more so.  I wish I had light hair and a fair skin,
and was dressed and behaved as well, and had a chance of being as rich as
he will be!'

'And cried for mamma at every turn,' I added, 'and trembled if a country
lad heaved his fist against you, and sat at home all day for a shower of
rain.  Oh, Heathcliff, you are showing a poor spirit!  Come to the glass,
and I'll let you see what you should wish.  Do you mark those two lines
between your eyes; and those thick brows, that, instead of rising arched,
sink in the middle; and that couple of black fiends, so deeply buried,
who never open their windows boldly, but lurk glinting under them, like
devil's spies?  Wish and learn to smooth away the surly wrinkles, to
raise your lids frankly, and change the fiends to confident, innocent
angels, suspecting and doubting nothing, and always seeing friends where
they are not sure of foes.  Don't get the expression of a vicious cur
that appears to know the kicks it gets are its dessert, and yet hates all
the world, as well as the kicker, for what it suffers.'

'In other words, I must wish for Edgar Linton's great blue eyes and even
forehead,' he replied.  'I do--and that won't help me to them.'

'A good heart will help you to a bonny face, my lad,' I continued, 'if
you were a regular black; and a bad one will turn the bonniest into
something worse than ugly.  And now that we've done washing, and combing,
and sulking--tell me whether you don't think yourself rather handsome?
I'll tell you, I do.  You're fit for a prince in disguise.  Who knows but
your father was Emperor of China, and your mother an Indian queen, each
of them able to buy up, with one week's income, Wuthering Heights and
Thrushcross Grange together?  And you were kidnapped by wicked sailors
and brought to England.  Were I in your place, I would frame high notions
of my birth; and the thoughts of what I was should give me courage and
dignity to support the oppressions of a little farmer!'

So I chattered on; and Heathcliff gradually lost his frown and began to
look quite pleasant, when all at once our conversation was interrupted by
a rumbling sound moving up the road and entering the court.  He ran to
the window and I to the door, just in time to behold the two Lintons
descend from the family carriage, smothered in cloaks and furs, and the
Earnshaws dismount from their horses: they often rode to church in
winter.  Catherine took a hand of each of the children, and brought them
into the house and set them before the fire, which quickly put colour
into their white faces.

I urged my companion to hasten now and show his amiable humour, and he
willingly obeyed; but ill luck would have it that, as he opened the door
leading from the kitchen on one side, Hindley opened it on the other.
They met, and the master, irritated at seeing him clean and cheerful, or,
perhaps, eager to keep his promise to Mrs. Linton, shoved him back with a
sudden thrust, and angrily bade Joseph 'keep the fellow out of the
room--send him into the garret till dinner is over.  He'll be cramming
his fingers in the tarts and stealing the fruit, if left alone with them
a minute.'

'Nay, sir,' I could not avoid answering, 'he'll touch nothing, not he:
and I suppose he must have his share of the dainties as well as we.'

'He shall have his share of my hand, if I catch him downstairs till
dark,' cried Hindley.  'Begone, you vagabond!  What! you are attempting
the coxcomb, are you?  Wait till I get hold of those elegant locks--see
if I won't pull them a bit longer!'

'They are long enough already,' observed Master Linton, peeping from the
doorway; 'I wonder they don't make his head ache.  It's like a colt's
mane over his eyes!'

He ventured this remark without any intention to insult; but Heathcliff's
violent nature was not prepared to endure the appearance of impertinence
from one whom he seemed to hate, even then, as a rival.  He seized a
tureen of hot apple sauce (the first thing that came under his grip) and
dashed it full against the speaker's face and neck; who instantly
commenced a lament that brought Isabella and Catherine hurrying to the
place.  Mr. Earnshaw snatched up the culprit directly and conveyed him to
his chamber; where, doubtless, he administered a rough remedy to cool the
fit of passion, for he appeared red and breathless.  I got the dishcloth,
and rather spitefully scrubbed Edgar's nose and mouth, affirming it
served him right for meddling.  His sister began weeping to go home, and
Cathy stood by confounded, blushing for all.

'You should not have spoken to him!' she expostulated with Master Linton.
'He was in a bad temper, and now you've spoilt your visit; and he'll be
flogged: I hate him to be flogged!  I can't eat my dinner.  Why did you
speak to him, Edgar?'

'I didn't,' sobbed the youth, escaping from my hands, and finishing the
remainder of the purification with his cambric pocket-handkerchief.  'I
promised mamma that I wouldn't say one word to him, and I didn't.'

'Well, don't cry,' replied Catherine, contemptuously; 'you're not killed.
Don't make more mischief; my brother is coming: be quiet!  Hush,
Isabella!  Has anybody hurt you?'

'There, there, children--to your seats!' cried Hindley, bustling in.
'That brute of a lad has warmed me nicely.  Next time, Master Edgar, take
the law into your own fists--it will give you an appetite!'

The little party recovered its equanimity at sight of the fragrant feast.
They were hungry after their ride, and easily consoled, since no real
harm had befallen them.  Mr. Earnshaw carved bountiful platefuls, and the
mistress made them merry with lively talk.  I waited behind her chair,
and was pained to behold Catherine, with dry eyes and an indifferent air,
commence cutting up the wing of a goose before her.  'An unfeeling
child,' I thought to myself; 'how lightly she dismisses her old
playmate's troubles.  I could not have imagined her to be so selfish.'
She lifted a mouthful to her lips: then she set it down again: her cheeks
flushed, and the tears gushed over them.  She slipped her fork to the
floor, and hastily dived under the cloth to conceal her emotion.  I did
not call her unfeeling long; for I perceived she was in purgatory
throughout the day, and wearying to find an opportunity of getting by
herself, or paying a visit to Heathcliff, who had been locked up by the
master: as I discovered, on endeavouring to introduce to him a private
mess of victuals.

In the evening we had a dance.  Cathy begged that he might be liberated
then, as Isabella Linton had no partner: her entreaties were vain, and I
was appointed to supply the deficiency.  We got rid of all gloom in the
excitement of the exercise, and our pleasure was increased by the arrival
of the Gimmerton band, mustering fifteen strong: a trumpet, a trombone,
clarionets, bassoons, French horns, and a bass viol, besides singers.
They go the rounds of all the respectable houses, and receive
contributions every Christmas, and we esteemed it a first-rate treat to
hear them.  After the usual carols had been sung, we set them to songs
and glees.  Mrs. Earnshaw loved the music, and so they gave us plenty.

Catherine loved it too: but she said it sounded sweetest at the top of
the steps, and she went up in the dark: I followed. They shut the house
door below, never noting our absence, it was so full of people. She made
no stay at the stairs'-head, but mounted farther, to the garret where
Heathcliff was confined, and called him. He stubbornly declined
answering for a while: she persevered, and finally persuaded him to hold
communion with her through the boards. I let the poor things converse
unmolested, till I supposed the songs were going to cease, and the
singers to get some refreshment: then I clambered up the ladder to warn
her. Instead of finding her outside, I heard her voice within. The
little monkey had crept by the skylight of one garret, along the roof,
into the skylight of the other, and it was with the utmost difficulty I
could coax her out again. When she did come, Heathcliff came with her,
and she insisted that I should take him into the kitchen, as my
fellow-servant had gone to a neighbour's, to be removed from the sound
of our 'devil's psalmody,' as it pleased him to call it. I told them I
intended by no means to encourage their tricks: but as the prisoner had
never broken his fast since yesterday's dinner, I would wink at his
cheating Mr. Hindley that once. He went down: I set him a stool by the
fire, and offered him a quantity of good things: but he was sick and
could eat little, and my attempts to entertain him were thrown away. He
leant his two elbows on his knees, and his chin on his hands and
remained rapt in dumb meditation. On my inquiring the subject of his
thoughts, he answered gravely--'I'm trying to settle how I shall pay
Hindley back. I don't care how long I wait, if I can only do it at last.
I hope he will not die before I do!'

'For shame, Heathcliff!' said I.  'It is for God to punish wicked people;
we should learn to forgive.'

'No, God won't have the satisfaction that I shall,' he returned.  'I only
wish I knew the best way!  Let me alone, and I'll plan it out: while I'm
thinking of that I don't feel pain.'

'But, Mr. Lockwood, I forget these tales cannot divert you.  I'm annoyed
how I should dream of chattering on at such a rate; and your gruel cold,
and you nodding for bed!  I could have told Heathcliff's history, all
that you need hear, in half a dozen words.'

* * * * *

Thus interrupting herself, the housekeeper rose, and proceeded to lay
aside her sewing; but I felt incapable of moving from the hearth, and I
was very far from nodding.  'Sit still, Mrs. Dean,' I cried; 'do sit
still another half-hour.  You've done just right to tell the story
leisurely.  That is the method I like; and you must finish it in the same
style.  I am interested in every character you have mentioned, more or
less.'

'The clock is on the stroke of eleven, sir.'

'No matter--I'm not accustomed to go to bed in the long hours.  One or
two is early enough for a person who lies till ten.'

'You shouldn't lie till ten.  There's the very prime of the morning gone
long before that time.  A person who has not done one-half his day's work
by ten o'clock, runs a chance of leaving the other half undone.'

'Nevertheless, Mrs. Dean, resume your chair; because to-morrow I intend
lengthening the night till afternoon.  I prognosticate for myself an
obstinate cold, at least.'

'I hope not, sir.  Well, you must allow me to leap over some three years;
during that space Mrs. Earnshaw--'

'No, no, I'll allow nothing of the sort!  Are you acquainted with the
mood of mind in which, if you were seated alone, and the cat licking its
kitten on the rug before you, you would watch the operation so intently
that puss's neglect of one ear would put you seriously out of temper?'

'A terribly lazy mood, I should say.'

'On the contrary, a tiresomely active one. It is mine, at present; and,
therefore, continue minutely. I perceive that people in these regions
acquire over people in towns the value that a spider in a dungeon does
over a spider in a cottage, to their various occupants; and yet the
deepened attraction is not entirely owing to the situation of the
looker-on. They _do_ live more in earnest, more in themselves, and less
in surface, change, and frivolous external things. I could fancy a love
for life here almost possible; and I was a fixed unbeliever in any love
of a year's standing. One state resembles setting a hungry man down to a
single dish, on which he may concentrate his entire appetite and do it
justice; the other, introducing him to a table laid out by French cooks:
he can perhaps extract as much enjoyment from the whole; but each part
is a mere atom in his regard and remembrance.'

'Oh! here we are the same as anywhere else, when you get to know us,'
observed Mrs. Dean, somewhat puzzled at my speech.

'Excuse me,' I responded; 'you, my good friend, are a striking evidence
against that assertion.  Excepting a few provincialisms of slight
consequence, you have no marks of the manners which I am habituated to
consider as peculiar to your class.  I am sure you have thought a great
deal more than the generality of servants think.  You have been compelled
to cultivate your reflective faculties for want of occasions for
frittering your life away in silly trifles.'

Mrs. Dean laughed.

'I certainly esteem myself a steady, reasonable kind of body,' she said;
'not exactly from living among the hills and seeing one set of faces, and
one series of actions, from year's end to year's end; but I have
undergone sharp discipline, which has taught me wisdom; and then, I have
read more than you would fancy, Mr. Lockwood.  You could not open a book
in this library that I have not looked into, and got something out of
also: unless it be that range of Greek and Latin, and that of French; and
those I know one from another: it is as much as you can expect of a poor
man's daughter.  However, if I am to follow my story in true gossip's
fashion, I had better go on; and instead of leaping three years, I will
be content to pass to the next summer--the summer of 1778, that is nearly
twenty-three years ago.'




CHAPTER VIII


On the morning of a fine June day my first bonny little nursling, and the
last of the ancient Earnshaw stock, was born.  We were busy with the hay
in a far-away field, when the girl that usually brought our breakfasts
came running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the lane, calling
me as she ran.

'Oh, such a grand bairn!' she panted out.  'The finest lad that ever
breathed!  But the doctor says missis must go: he says she's been in a
consumption these many months.  I heard him tell Mr. Hindley: and now she
has nothing to keep her, and she'll be dead before winter.  You must come
home directly.  You're to nurse it, Nelly: to feed it with sugar and
milk, and take care of it day and night.  I wish I were you, because it
will be all yours when there is no missis!'

'But is she very ill?' I asked, flinging down my rake and tying my
bonnet.

'I guess she is; yet she looks bravely,' replied the girl, 'and she talks
as if she thought of living to see it grow a man.  She's out of her head
for joy, it's such a beauty!  If I were her I'm certain I should not die:
I should get better at the bare sight of it, in spite of Kenneth.  I was
fairly mad at him.  Dame Archer brought the cherub down to master, in the
house, and his face just began to light up, when the old croaker steps
forward, and says he--"Earnshaw, it's a blessing your wife has been
spared to leave you this son.  When she came, I felt convinced we
shouldn't keep her long; and now, I must tell you, the winter will
probably finish her.  Don't take on, and fret about it too much: it can't
be helped.  And besides, you should have known better than to choose such
a rush of a lass!"'

'And what did the master answer?' I inquired.

'I think he swore: but I didn't mind him, I was straining to see the
bairn,' and she began again to describe it rapturously.  I, as zealous as
herself, hurried eagerly home to admire, on my part; though I was very
sad for Hindley's sake.  He had room in his heart only for two idols--his
wife and himself: he doted on both, and adored one, and I couldn't
conceive how he would bear the loss.

When we got to Wuthering Heights, there he stood at the front door; and,
as I passed in, I asked, 'how was the baby?'

'Nearly ready to run about, Nell!' he replied, putting on a cheerful
smile.

'And the mistress?' I ventured to inquire; 'the doctor says she's--'

'Damn the doctor!' he interrupted, reddening.  'Frances is quite right:
she'll be perfectly well by this time next week.  Are you going
up-stairs? will you tell her that I'll come, if she'll promise not to
talk.  I left her because she would not hold her tongue; and she
must--tell her Mr. Kenneth says she must be quiet.'

I delivered this message to Mrs. Earnshaw; she seemed in flighty spirits,
and replied merrily, 'I hardly spoke a word, Ellen, and there he has gone
out twice, crying.  Well, say I promise I won't speak: but that does not
bind me not to laugh at him!'

Poor soul!  Till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed
her; and her husband persisted doggedly, nay, furiously, in affirming her
health improved every day.  When Kenneth warned him that his medicines
were useless at that stage of the malady, and he needn't put him to
further expense by attending her, he retorted, 'I know you need not--she's
well--she does not want any more attendance from you!  She never was in a
consumption.  It was a fever; and it is gone: her pulse is as slow as
mine now, and her cheek as cool.'

He told his wife the same story, and she seemed to believe him; but one
night, while leaning on his shoulder, in the act of saying she thought
she should be able to get up to-morrow, a fit of coughing took her--a
very slight one--he raised her in his arms; she put her two hands about
his neck, her face changed, and she was dead.

As the girl had anticipated, the child Hareton fell wholly into my hands.
Mr. Earnshaw, provided he saw him healthy and never heard him cry, was
contented, as far as regarded him.  For himself, he grew desperate: his
sorrow was of that kind that will not lament.  He neither wept nor
prayed; he cursed and defied: execrated God and man, and gave himself up
to reckless dissipation.  The servants could not bear his tyrannical and
evil conduct long: Joseph and I were the only two that would stay.  I had
not the heart to leave my charge; and besides, you know, I had been his
foster-sister, and excused his behaviour more readily than a stranger
would.  Joseph remained to hector over tenants and labourers; and because
it was his vocation to be where he had plenty of wickedness to reprove.

The master's bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for
Catherine and Heathcliff.  His treatment of the latter was enough to make
a fiend of a saint.  And, truly, it appeared as if the lad _were_
possessed of something diabolical at that period.  He delighted to
witness Hindley degrading himself past redemption; and became daily more
notable for savage sullenness and ferocity.  I could not half tell what
an infernal house we had.  The curate dropped calling, and nobody decent
came near us, at last; unless Edgar Linton's visits to Miss Cathy might
be an exception.  At fifteen she was the queen of the country-side; she
had no peer; and she did turn out a haughty, headstrong creature!  I own
I did not like her, after infancy was past; and I vexed her frequently by
trying to bring down her arrogance: she never took an aversion to me,
though.  She had a wondrous constancy to old attachments: even Heathcliff
kept his hold on her affections unalterably; and young Linton, with all
his superiority, found it difficult to make an equally deep impression.
He was my late master: that is his portrait over the fireplace.  It used
to hang on one side, and his wife's on the other; but hers has been
removed, or else you might see something of what she was.  Can you make
that out?

Mrs. Dean raised the candle, and I discerned a soft-featured face,
exceedingly resembling the young lady at the Heights, but more pensive
and amiable in expression.  It formed a sweet picture.  The long light
hair curled slightly on the temples; the eyes were large and serious; the
figure almost too graceful.  I did not marvel how Catherine Earnshaw
could forget her first friend for such an individual.  I marvelled much
how he, with a mind to correspond with his person, could fancy my idea of
Catherine Earnshaw.

'A very agreeable portrait,' I observed to the house-keeper.  'Is it
like?'

'Yes,' she answered; 'but he looked better when he was animated; that is
his everyday countenance: he wanted spirit in general.'

Catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the Lintons since her
five-weeks' residence among them; and as she had no temptation to show
her rough side in their company, and had the sense to be ashamed of
being rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy, she imposed
unwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality;
gained the admiration of Isabella, and the heart and soul of her
brother: acquisitions that flattered her from the first--for she was
full of ambition--and led her to adopt a double character without
exactly intending to deceive any one. In the place where she heard
Heathcliff termed a 'vulgar young ruffian,' and 'worse than a brute,'
she took care not to act like him; but at home she had small inclination
to practise politeness that would only be laughed at, and restrain an
unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor praise.

Mr. Edgar seldom mustered courage to visit Wuthering Heights openly.  He
had a terror of Earnshaw's reputation, and shrunk from encountering him;
and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility: the
master himself avoided offending him, knowing why he came; and if he
could not be gracious, kept out of the way.  I rather think his
appearance there was distasteful to Catherine; she was not artful, never
played the coquette, and had evidently an objection to her two friends
meeting at all; for when Heathcliff expressed contempt of Linton in his
presence, she could not half coincide, as she did in his absence; and
when Linton evinced disgust and antipathy to Heathcliff, she dared not
treat his sentiments with indifference, as if depreciation of her
playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her.  I've had many a laugh
at her perplexities and untold troubles, which she vainly strove to hide
from my mockery.  That sounds ill-natured: but she was so proud it became
really impossible to pity her distresses, till she should be chastened
into more humility.  She did bring herself, finally, to confess, and to
confide in me: there was not a soul else that she might fashion into an
adviser.

Mr. Hindley had gone from home one afternoon, and Heathcliff presumed to
give himself a holiday on the strength of it.  He had reached the age of
sixteen then, I think, and without having bad features, or being
deficient in intellect, he contrived to convey an impression of inward
and outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of.
In the first place, he had by that time lost the benefit of his early
education: continual hard work, begun soon and concluded late, had
extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge, and
any love for books or learning.  His childhood's sense of superiority,
instilled into him by the favours of old Mr. Earnshaw, was faded away.  He
struggled long to keep up an equality with Catherine in her studies, and
yielded with poignant though silent regret: but he yielded completely;
and there was no prevailing on him to take a step in the way of moving
upward, when he found he must, necessarily, sink beneath his former
level.  Then personal appearance sympathised with mental deterioration:
he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look; his naturally reserved
disposition was exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of unsociable
moroseness; and he took a grim pleasure, apparently, in exciting the
aversion rather than the esteem of his few acquaintances.

Catherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of respite
from labour; but he had ceased to express his fondness for her in words,
and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses, as if
conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks of
affection on him.  On the before-named occasion he came into the house to
announce his intention of doing nothing, while I was assisting Miss Cathy
to arrange her dress: she had not reckoned on his taking it into his head
to be idle; and imagining she would have the whole place to herself, she
managed, by some means, to inform Mr. Edgar of her brother's absence, and
was then preparing to receive him.

'Cathy, are you busy this afternoon?' asked Heathcliff.  'Are you going
anywhere?'

'No, it is raining,' she answered.

'Why have you that silk frock on, then?' he said.  'Nobody coming here, I
hope?'

'Not that I know of,' stammered Miss: 'but you should be in the field
now, Heathcliff.  It is an hour past dinnertime: I thought you were
gone.'

'Hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence,' observed the
boy.  'I'll not work any more to-day: I'll stay with you.'

'Oh, but Joseph will tell,' she suggested; 'you'd better go!'

'Joseph is loading lime on the further side of Penistone Crags; it will
take him till dark, and he'll never know.'

So, saying, he lounged to the fire, and sat down.  Catherine reflected an
instant, with knitted brows--she found it needful to smooth the way for
an intrusion.  'Isabella and Edgar Linton talked of calling this
afternoon,' she said, at the conclusion of a minute's silence.  'As it
rains, I hardly expect them; but they may come, and if they do, you run
the risk of being scolded for no good.'

'Order Ellen to say you are engaged, Cathy,' he persisted; 'don't turn me
out for those pitiful, silly friends of yours!  I'm on the point,
sometimes, of complaining that they--but I'll not--'

'That they what?' cried Catherine, gazing at him with a troubled
countenance.  'Oh, Nelly!' she added petulantly, jerking her head away
from my hands, 'you've combed my hair quite out of curl!  That's enough;
let me alone.  What are you on the point of complaining about,
Heathcliff?'

'Nothing--only look at the almanack on that wall;' he pointed to a framed
sheet hanging near the window, and continued, 'The crosses are for the
evenings you have spent with the Lintons, the dots for those spent with
me.  Do you see?  I've marked every day.'

'Yes--very foolish: as if I took notice!' replied Catherine, in a peevish
tone.  'And where is the sense of that?'

'To show that I _do_ take notice,' said Heathcliff.

'And should I always be sitting with you?' she demanded, growing more
irritated.  'What good do I get?  What do you talk about?  You might be
dumb, or a baby, for anything you say to amuse me, or for anything you
do, either!'

'You never told me before that I talked too little, or that you disliked
my company, Cathy!' exclaimed Heathcliff, in much agitation.

'It's no company at all, when people know nothing and say nothing,' she
muttered.

Her companion rose up, but he hadn't time to express his feelings
further, for a horse's feet were heard on the flags, and having knocked
gently, young Linton entered, his face brilliant with delight at the
unexpected summon she had received.  Doubtless Catherine marked the
difference between her friends, as one came in and the other went out.
The contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak, hilly, coal
country for a beautiful fertile valley; and his voice and greeting were
as opposite as his aspect.  He had a sweet, low manner of speaking, and
pronounced his words as you do: that's less gruff than we talk here, and
softer.

'I'm not come too soon, am I?' he said, casting a look at me: I had begun
to wipe the plate, and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser.

'No,' answered Catherine.  'What are you doing there, Nelly?'

'My work, Miss,' I replied.  (Mr. Hindley had given me directions to make
a third party in any private visits Linton chose to pay.)

She stepped behind me and whispered crossly, 'Take yourself and your
dusters off; when company are in the house, servants don't commence
scouring and cleaning in the room where they are!'

'It's a good opportunity, now that master is away,' I answered aloud: 'he
hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence.  I'm sure Mr.
Edgar will excuse me.'

'I hate you to be fidgeting in _my_ presence,' exclaimed the young lady
imperiously, not allowing her guest time to speak: she had failed to
recover her equanimity since the little dispute with Heathcliff.

'I'm sorry for it, Miss Catherine,' was my response; and I proceeded
assiduously with my occupation.

She, supposing Edgar could not see her, snatched the cloth from my hand,
and pinched me, with a prolonged wrench, very spitefully on the arm.  I've
said I did not love her, and rather relished mortifying her vanity now
and then: besides, she hurt me extremely; so I started up from my knees,
and screamed out, 'Oh, Miss, that's a nasty trick!  You have no right to
nip me, and I'm not going to bear it.'

'I didn't touch you, you lying creature!' cried she, her fingers tingling
to repeat the act, and her ears red with rage.  She never had power to
conceal her passion, it always set her whole complexion in a blaze.

'What's that, then?' I retorted, showing a decided purple witness to
refute her.

She stamped her foot, wavered a moment, and then, irresistibly impelled
by the naughty spirit within her, slapped me on the cheek: a stinging
blow that filled both eyes with water.

'Catherine, love!  Catherine!' interposed Linton, greatly shocked at the
double fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed.

'Leave the room, Ellen!' she repeated, trembling all over.

Little Hareton, who followed me everywhere, and was sitting near me on
the floor, at seeing my tears commenced crying himself, and sobbed out
complaints against 'wicked aunt Cathy,' which drew her fury on to his
unlucky head: she seized his shoulders, and shook him till the poor child
waxed livid, and Edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to deliver
him.  In an instant one was wrung free, and the astonished young man felt
it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be mistaken for jest.
He drew back in consternation.  I lifted Hareton in my arms, and walked
off to the kitchen with him, leaving the door of communication open, for
I was curious to watch how they would settle their disagreement.  The
insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had laid his hat, pale and
with a quivering lip.

'That's right!' I said to myself.  'Take warning and begone!  It's a
kindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition.'

'Where are you going?' demanded Catherine, advancing to the door.

He swerved aside, and attempted to pass.

'You must not go!' she exclaimed, energetically.

'I must and shall!' he replied in a subdued voice.

'No,' she persisted, grasping the handle; 'not yet, Edgar Linton: sit
down; you shall not leave me in that temper.  I should be miserable all
night, and I won't be miserable for you!'

'Can I stay after you have struck me?' asked Linton.

Catherine was mute.

'You've made me afraid and ashamed of you,' he continued; 'I'll not come
here again!'

Her eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle.

'And you told a deliberate untruth!' he said.

'I didn't!' she cried, recovering her speech; 'I did nothing
deliberately.  Well, go, if you please--get away!  And now I'll cry--I'll
cry myself sick!'

She dropped down on her knees by a chair, and set to weeping in serious
earnest.  Edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court; there
he lingered.  I resolved to encourage him.

'Miss is dreadfully wayward, sir,' I called out.  'As bad as any marred
child: you'd better be riding home, or else she will be sick, only to
grieve us.'

The soft thing looked askance through the window: he possessed the power
to depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse half
killed, or a bird half eaten.  Ah, I thought, there will be no saving
him: he's doomed, and flies to his fate!  And so it was: he turned
abruptly, hastened into the house again, shut the door behind him; and
when I went in a while after to inform them that Earnshaw had come home
rabid drunk, ready to pull the whole place about our ears (his ordinary
frame of mind in that condition), I saw the quarrel had merely effected a
closer intimacy--had broken the outworks of youthful timidity, and
enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship, and confess
themselves lovers.

Intelligence of Mr. Hindley's arrival drove Linton speedily to his horse,
and Catherine to her chamber.  I went to hide little Hareton, and to take
the shot out of the master's fowling-piece, which he was fond of playing
with in his insane excitement, to the hazard of the lives of any who
provoked, or even attracted his notice too much; and I had hit upon the
plan of removing it, that he might do less mischief if he did go the
length of firing the gun.




CHAPTER IX


He entered, vociferating oaths dreadful to hear; and caught me in the act
of stowing his son away in the kitchen cupboard.  Hareton was impressed
with a wholesome terror of encountering either his wild beast's fondness
or his madman's rage; for in one he ran a chance of being squeezed and
kissed to death, and in the other of being flung into the fire, or dashed
against the wall; and the poor thing remained perfectly quiet wherever I
chose to put him.

'There, I've found it out at last!' cried Hindley, pulling me back by the
skin of my neck, like a dog.  'By heaven and hell, you've sworn between
you to murder that child!  I know how it is, now, that he is always out
of my way.  But, with the help of Satan, I shall make you swallow the
carving-knife, Nelly!  You needn't laugh; for I've just crammed Kenneth,
head-downmost, in the Black-horse marsh; and two is the same as one--and
I want to kill some of you: I shall have no rest till I do!'

'But I don't like the carving-knife, Mr. Hindley,' I answered; 'it has
been cutting red herrings.  I'd rather be shot, if you please.'

'You'd rather be damned!' he said; 'and so you shall.  No law in England
can hinder a man from keeping his house decent, and mine's abominable!
Open your mouth.'  He held the knife in his hand, and pushed its point
between my teeth: but, for my part, I was never much afraid of his
vagaries.  I spat out, and affirmed it tasted detestably--I would not
take it on any account.

'Oh!' said he, releasing me, 'I see that hideous little villain is not
Hareton: I beg your pardon, Nell.  If it be, he deserves flaying alive
for not running to welcome me, and for screaming as if I were a goblin.
Unnatural cub, come hither!  I'll teach thee to impose on a good-hearted,
deluded father.  Now, don't you think the lad would be handsomer cropped?
It makes a dog fiercer, and I love something fierce--get me a
scissors--something fierce and trim!  Besides, it's infernal
affectation--devilish conceit it is, to cherish our ears--we're asses
enough without them.  Hush, child, hush!  Well then, it is my darling!
wisht, dry thy eyes--there's a joy; kiss me.  What! it won't?  Kiss me,
Hareton!  Damn thee, kiss me!  By God, as if I would rear such a monster!
As sure as I'm living, I'll break the brat's neck.'

Poor Hareton was squalling and kicking in his father's arms with all his
might, and redoubled his yells when he carried him up-stairs and lifted
him over the banister.  I cried out that he would frighten the child into
fits, and ran to rescue him.  As I reached them, Hindley leant forward on
the rails to listen to a noise below; almost forgetting what he had in
his hands.  'Who is that?' he asked, hearing some one approaching the
stairs'-foot.  I leant forward also, for the purpose of signing to
Heathcliff, whose step I recognised, not to come further; and, at the
instant when my eye quitted Hareton, he gave a sudden spring, delivered
himself from the careless grasp that held him, and fell.

There was scarcely time to experience a thrill of horror before we saw
that the little wretch was safe.  Heathcliff arrived underneath just at
the critical moment; by a natural impulse he arrested his descent, and
setting him on his feet, looked up to discover the author of the
accident.  A miser who has parted with a lucky lottery ticket for five
shillings, and finds next day he has lost in the bargain five thousand
pounds, could not show a blanker countenance than he did on beholding the
figure of Mr. Earnshaw above.  It expressed, plainer than words could do,
the intensest anguish at having made himself the instrument of thwarting
his own revenge.  Had it been dark, I daresay he would have tried to
remedy the mistake by smashing Hareton's skull on the steps; but, we
witnessed his salvation; and I was presently below with my precious
charge pressed to my heart.  Hindley descended more leisurely, sobered
and abashed.

'It is your fault, Ellen,' he said; 'you should have kept him out of
sight: you should have taken him from me!  Is he injured anywhere?'

'Injured!' I cried angrily; 'if he is not killed, he'll be an idiot!  Oh!
I wonder his mother does not rise from her grave to see how you use him.
You're worse than a heathen--treating your own flesh and blood in that
manner!'  He attempted to touch the child, who, on finding himself with
me, sobbed off his terror directly.  At the first finger his father laid
on him, however, he shrieked again louder than before, and struggled as
if he would go into convulsions.

'You shall not meddle with him!' I continued.  'He hates you--they all
hate you--that's the truth!  A happy family you have; and a pretty state
you're come to!'

'I shall come to a prettier, yet, Nelly,' laughed the misguided man,
recovering his hardness.  'At present, convey yourself and him away.  And
hark you, Heathcliff! clear you too quite from my reach and hearing.  I
wouldn't murder you to-night; unless, perhaps, I set the house on fire:
but that's as my fancy goes.'

While saying this he took a pint bottle of brandy from the dresser, and
poured some into a tumbler.

'Nay, don't!' I entreated.  'Mr. Hindley, do take warning.  Have mercy on
this unfortunate boy, if you care nothing for yourself!'

'Any one will do better for him than I shall,' he answered.

'Have mercy on your own soul!' I said, endeavouring to snatch the glass
from his hand.

'Not I!  On the contrary, I shall have great pleasure in sending it to
perdition to punish its Maker,' exclaimed the blasphemer.  'Here's to its
hearty damnation!'

He drank the spirits and impatiently bade us go; terminating his command
with a sequel of horrid imprecations too bad to repeat or remember.

'It's a pity he cannot kill himself with drink,' observed Heathcliff,
muttering an echo of curses back when the door was shut.  'He's doing his
very utmost; but his constitution defies him.  Mr. Kenneth says he would
wager his mare that he'll outlive any man on this side Gimmerton, and go
to the grave a hoary sinner; unless some happy chance out of the common
course befall him.'

I went into the kitchen, and sat down to lull my little lamb to sleep.
Heathcliff, as I thought, walked through to the barn.  It turned out
afterwards that he only got as far as the other side the settle, when he
flung himself on a bench by the wall, removed from the fire and remained
silent.

I was rocking Hareton on my knee, and humming a song that began,--

   It was far in the night, and the bairnies grat,
   The mither beneath the mools heard that,

when Miss Cathy, who had listened to the hubbub from her room, put her
head in, and whispered,--'Are you alone, Nelly?'

'Yes, Miss,' I replied.

She entered and approached the hearth.  I, supposing she was going to say
something, looked up.  The expression of her face seemed disturbed and
anxious.  Her lips were half asunder, as if she meant to speak, and she
drew a breath; but it escaped in a sigh instead of a sentence.  I resumed
my song; not having forgotten her recent behaviour.

'Where's Heathcliff?' she said, interrupting me.

'About his work in the stable,' was my answer.

He did not contradict me; perhaps he had fallen into a doze.  There
followed another long pause, during which I perceived a drop or two
trickle from Catherine's cheek to the flags.  Is she sorry for her
shameful conduct?--I asked myself.  That will be a novelty: but she may
come to the point--as she will--I sha'n't help her!  No, she felt small
trouble regarding any subject, save her own concerns.

'Oh, dear!' she cried at last.  'I'm very unhappy!'

'A pity,' observed I.  'You're hard to please; so many friends and so few
cares, and can't make yourself content!'

'Nelly, will you keep a secret for me?' she pursued, kneeling down by me,
and lifting her winsome eyes to my face with that sort of look which
turns off bad temper, even when one has all the right in the world to
indulge it.

'Is it worth keeping?' I inquired, less sulkily.

'Yes, and it worries me, and I must let it out!  I want to know what I
should do.  To-day, Edgar Linton has asked me to marry him, and I've
given him an answer.  Now, before I tell you whether it was a consent or
denial, you tell me which it ought to have been.'

'Really, Miss Catherine, how can I know?' I replied.  'To be sure,
considering the exhibition you performed in his presence this afternoon,
I might say it would be wise to refuse him: since he asked you after
that, he must either be hopelessly stupid or a venturesome fool.'

'If you talk so, I won't tell you any more,' she returned, peevishly
rising to her feet.  'I accepted him, Nelly.  Be quick, and say whether I
was wrong!'

'You accepted him!  Then what good is it discussing the matter?  You have
pledged your word, and cannot retract.'

'But say whether I should have done so--do!' she exclaimed in an
irritated tone; chafing her hands together, and frowning.

'There are many things to be considered before that question can be
answered properly,' I said, sententiously.  'First and foremost, do you
love Mr. Edgar?'

'Who can help it?  Of course I do,' she answered.

Then I put her through the following catechism: for a girl of twenty-two
it was not injudicious.

'Why do you love him, Miss Cathy?'

'Nonsense, I do--that's sufficient.'

'By no means; you must say why?'

'Well, because he is handsome, and pleasant to be with.'

'Bad!' was my commentary.

'And because he is young and cheerful.'

'Bad, still.'

'And because he loves me.'

'Indifferent, coming there.'

'And he will be rich, and I shall like to be the greatest woman of the
neighbourhood, and I shall be proud of having such a husband.'

'Worst of all.  And now, say how you love him?'

'As everybody loves--You're silly, Nelly.'

'Not at all--Answer.'

'I love the ground under his feet, and the air over his head, and
everything he touches, and every word he says.  I love all his looks, and
all his actions, and him entirely and altogether.  There now!'

'And why?'

'Nay; you are making a jest of it: it is exceedingly ill-natured!  It's
no jest to me!' said the young lady, scowling, and turning her face to
the fire.

'I'm very far from jesting, Miss Catherine,' I replied.  'You love Mr.
Edgar because he is handsome, and young, and cheerful, and rich, and
loves you.  The last, however, goes for nothing: you would love him
without that, probably; and with it you wouldn't, unless he possessed the
four former attractions.'

'No, to be sure not: I should only pity him--hate him, perhaps, if he
were ugly, and a clown.'

'But there are several other handsome, rich young men in the world:
handsomer, possibly, and richer than he is.  What should hinder you from
loving them?'

'If there be any, they are out of my way: I've seen none like Edgar.'

'You may see some; and he won't always be handsome, and young, and may
not always be rich.'

'He is now; and I have only to do with the present.  I wish you would
speak rationally.'

'Well, that settles it: if you have only to do with the present, marry
Mr. Linton.'

'I don't want your permission for that--I _shall_ marry him: and yet you
have not told me whether I'm right.'

'Perfectly right; if people be right to marry only for the present.  And
now, let us hear what you are unhappy about.  Your brother will be
pleased; the old lady and gentleman will not object, I think; you will
escape from a disorderly, comfortless home into a wealthy, respectable
one; and you love Edgar, and Edgar loves you.  All seems smooth and easy:
where is the obstacle?'

'_Here_! and _here_!' replied Catherine, striking one hand on her
forehead, and the other on her breast: 'in whichever place the soul
lives.  In my soul and in my heart, I'm convinced I'm wrong!'

'That's very strange!  I cannot make it out.'

'It's my secret.  But if you will not mock at me, I'll explain it: I
can't do it distinctly; but I'll give you a feeling of how I feel.'

She seated herself by me again: her countenance grew sadder and graver,
and her clasped hands trembled.

'Nelly, do you never dream queer dreams?' she said, suddenly, after some
minutes' reflection.

'Yes, now and then,' I answered.

'And so do I.  I've dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me
ever after, and changed my ideas: they've gone through and through me,
like wine through water, and altered the colour of my mind.  And this is
one: I'm going to tell it--but take care not to smile at any part of it.'

'Oh! don't, Miss Catherine!' I cried.  'We're dismal enough without
conjuring up ghosts and visions to perplex us.  Come, come, be merry and
like yourself!  Look at little Hareton! _he's_ dreaming nothing dreary.
How sweetly he smiles in his sleep!'

'Yes; and how sweetly his father curses in his solitude!  You remember
him, I daresay, when he was just such another as that chubby thing:
nearly as young and innocent.  However, Nelly, I shall oblige you to
listen: it's not long; and I've no power to be merry to-night.'

'I won't hear it, I won't hear it!' I repeated, hastily.

I was superstitious about dreams then, and am still; and Catherine had an
unusual gloom in her aspect, that made me dread something from which I
might shape a prophecy, and foresee a fearful catastrophe.  She was
vexed, but she did not proceed.  Apparently taking up another subject,
she recommenced in a short time.

'If I were in heaven, Nelly, I should be extremely miserable.'

'Because you are not fit to go there,' I answered.  'All sinners would be
miserable in heaven.'

'But it is not for that.  I dreamt once that I was there.'

'I tell you I won't hearken to your dreams, Miss Catherine!  I'll go to
bed,' I interrupted again.

She laughed, and held me down; for I made a motion to leave my chair.

'This is nothing,' cried she: 'I was only going to say that heaven did
not seem to be my home; and I broke my heart with weeping to come back to
earth; and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the
middle of the heath on the top of Wuthering Heights; where I woke sobbing
for joy.  That will do to explain my secret, as well as the other.  I've
no more business to marry Edgar Linton than I have to be in heaven; and
if the wicked man in there had not brought Heathcliff so low, I shouldn't
have thought of it.  It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; so he
shall never know how I love him: and that, not because he's handsome,
Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am.  Whatever our souls are
made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a
moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire.'

Ere this speech ended I became sensible of Heathcliff's presence.  Having
noticed a slight movement, I turned my head, and saw him rise from the
bench, and steal out noiselessly.  He had listened till he heard
Catherine say it would degrade her to marry him, and then he stayed to
hear no further.  My companion, sitting on the ground, was prevented by
the back of the settle from remarking his presence or departure; but I
started, and bade her hush!

'Why?' she asked, gazing nervously round.

'Joseph is here,' I answered, catching opportunely the roll of his
cartwheels up the road; 'and Heathcliff will come in with him.  I'm not
sure whether he were not at the door this moment.'

'Oh, he couldn't overhear me at the door!' said she.  'Give me Hareton,
while you get the supper, and when it is ready ask me to sup with you.  I
want to cheat my uncomfortable conscience, and be convinced that
Heathcliff has no notion of these things.  He has not, has he?  He does
not know what being in love is!'

'I see no reason that he should not know, as well as you,' I returned;
'and if you are his choice, he'll be the most unfortunate creature that
ever was born!  As soon as you become Mrs. Linton, he loses friend, and
love, and all!  Have you considered how you'll bear the separation, and
how he'll bear to be quite deserted in the world?  Because, Miss
Catherine--'

'He quite deserted! we separated!' she exclaimed, with an accent of
indignation.  'Who is to separate us, pray?  They'll meet the fate of
Milo!  Not as long as I live, Ellen: for no mortal creature.  Every
Linton on the face of the earth might melt into nothing before I could
consent to forsake Heathcliff.  Oh, that's not what I intend--that's not
what I mean!  I shouldn't be Mrs. Linton were such a price demanded!
He'll be as much to me as he has been all his lifetime.  Edgar must shake
off his antipathy, and tolerate him, at least.  He will, when he learns
my true feelings towards him.  Nelly, I see now you think me a selfish
wretch; but did it never strike you that if Heathcliff and I married, we
should be beggars? whereas, if I marry Linton I can aid Heathcliff to
rise, and place him out of my brother's power.'

'With your husband's money, Miss Catherine?' I asked.  'You'll find him
not so pliable as you calculate upon: and, though I'm hardly a judge, I
think that's the worst motive you've given yet for being the wife of
young Linton.'

'It is not,' retorted she; 'it is the best!  The others were the
satisfaction of my whims: and for Edgar's sake, too, to satisfy him.  This
is for the sake of one who comprehends in his person my feelings to Edgar
and myself.  I cannot express it; but surely you and everybody have a
notion that there is or should be an existence of yours beyond you.  What
were the use of my creation, if I were entirely contained here?  My great
miseries in this world have been Heathcliff's miseries, and I watched and
felt each from the beginning: my great thought in living is himself.  If
all else perished, and _he_ remained, _I_ should still continue to be;
and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would
turn to a mighty stranger: I should not seem a part of it.--My love for
Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well
aware, as winter changes the trees.  My love for Heathcliff resembles the
eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary.
Nelly, I _am_ Heathcliff!  He's always, always in my mind: not as a
pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own
being.  So don't talk of our separation again: it is impracticable; and--'

She paused, and hid her face in the folds of my gown; but I jerked it
forcibly away.  I was out of patience with her folly!

'If I can make any sense of your nonsense, Miss,' I said, 'it only goes
to convince me that you are ignorant of the duties you undertake in
marrying; or else that you are a wicked, unprincipled girl.  But trouble
me with no more secrets: I'll not promise to keep them.'

'You'll keep that?' she asked, eagerly.

'No, I'll not promise,' I repeated.

She was about to insist, when the entrance of Joseph finished our
conversation; and Catherine removed her seat to a corner, and nursed
Hareton, while I made the supper.  After it was cooked, my fellow-servant
and I began to quarrel who should carry some to Mr. Hindley; and we
didn't settle it till all was nearly cold.  Then we came to the agreement
that we would let him ask, if he wanted any; for we feared particularly
to go into his presence when he had been some time alone.

'And how isn't that nowt comed in fro' th' field, be this time?  What is
he about? girt idle seeght!' demanded the old man, looking round for
Heathcliff.

'I'll call him,' I replied.  'He's in the barn, I've no doubt.'

I went and called, but got no answer.  On returning, I whispered to
Catherine that he had heard a good part of what she said, I was sure; and
told how I saw him quit the kitchen just as she complained of her
brother's conduct regarding him.  She jumped up in a fine fright, flung
Hareton on to the settle, and ran to seek for her friend herself; not
taking leisure to consider why she was so flurried, or how her talk would
have affected him.  She was absent such a while that Joseph proposed we
should wait no longer.  He cunningly conjectured they were staying away
in order to avoid hearing his protracted blessing.  They were 'ill eneugh
for ony fahl manners,' he affirmed.  And on their behalf he added that
night a special prayer to the usual quarter-of-an-hour's supplication
before meat, and would have tacked another to the end of the grace, had
not his young mistress broken in upon him with a hurried command that he
must run down the road, and, wherever Heathcliff had rambled, find and
make him re-enter directly!

'I want to speak to him, and I _must_, before I go upstairs,' she said.
'And the gate is open: he is somewhere out of hearing; for he would not
reply, though I shouted at the top of the fold as loud as I could.'

Joseph objected at first; she was too much in earnest, however, to suffer
contradiction; and at last he placed his hat on his head, and walked
grumbling forth.  Meantime, Catherine paced up and down the floor,
exclaiming--'I wonder where he is--I wonder where he can be!  What did I
say, Nelly?  I've forgotten.  Was he vexed at my bad humour this
afternoon?  Dear! tell me what I've said to grieve him?  I do wish he'd
come.  I do wish he would!'

'What a noise for nothing!' I cried, though rather uneasy myself.  'What
a trifle scares you!  It's surely no great cause of alarm that Heathcliff
should take a moonlight saunter on the moors, or even lie too sulky to
speak to us in the hay-loft.  I'll engage he's lurking there.  See if I
don't ferret him out!'

I departed to renew my search; its result was disappointment, and
Joseph's quest ended in the same.

'Yon lad gets war und war!' observed he on re-entering.  'He's left th'
gate at t' full swing, and Miss's pony has trodden dahn two rigs o' corn,
and plottered through, raight o'er into t' meadow!  Hahsomdiver, t'
maister 'ull play t' devil to-morn, and he'll do weel.  He's patience
itsseln wi' sich careless, offald craters--patience itsseln he is!  Bud
he'll not be soa allus--yah's see, all on ye!  Yah mun'n't drive him out
of his heead for nowt!'

'Have you found Heathcliff, you ass?' interrupted Catherine.  'Have you
been looking for him, as I ordered?'

'I sud more likker look for th' horse,' he replied.  'It 'ud be to more
sense.  Bud I can look for norther horse nur man of a neeght loike
this--as black as t' chimbley! und Heathcliff's noan t' chap to coom at
_my_ whistle--happen he'll be less hard o' hearing wi' _ye_!'

It _was_ a very dark evening for summer: the clouds appeared inclined to
thunder, and I said we had better all sit down; the approaching rain
would be certain to bring him home without further trouble.  However,
Catherine would not be persuaded into tranquillity.  She kept wandering
to and fro, from the gate to the door, in a state of agitation which
permitted no repose; and at length took up a permanent situation on one
side of the wall, near the road: where, heedless of my expostulations and
the growling thunder, and the great drops that began to plash around her,
she remained, calling at intervals, and then listening, and then crying
outright.  She beat Hareton, or any child, at a good passionate fit of
crying.

About midnight, while we still sat up, the storm came rattling over the
Heights in full fury.  There was a violent wind, as well as thunder, and
either one or the other split a tree off at the corner of the building: a
huge bough fell across the roof, and knocked down a portion of the east
chimney-stack, sending a clatter of stones and soot into the
kitchen-fire.  We thought a bolt had fallen in the middle of us; and
Joseph swung on to his knees, beseeching the Lord to remember the
patriarchs Noah and Lot, and, as in former times, spare the righteous,
though he smote the ungodly.  I felt some sentiment that it must be a
judgment on us also.  The Jonah, in my mind, was Mr. Earnshaw; and I
shook the handle of his den that I might ascertain if he were yet living.
He replied audibly enough, in a fashion which made my companion
vociferate, more clamorously than before, that a wide distinction might
be drawn between saints like himself and sinners like his master.  But
the uproar passed away in twenty minutes, leaving us all unharmed;
excepting Cathy, who got thoroughly drenched for her obstinacy in
refusing to take shelter, and standing bonnetless and shawlless to catch
as much water as she could with her hair and clothes.  She came in and
lay down on the settle, all soaked as she was, turning her face to the
back, and putting her hands before it.

'Well, Miss!' I exclaimed, touching her shoulder; 'you are not bent on
getting your death, are you?  Do you know what o'clock it is?  Half-past
twelve.  Come, come to bed! there's no use waiting any longer on that
foolish boy: he'll be gone to Gimmerton, and he'll stay there now.  He
guesses we shouldn't wait for him till this late hour: at least, he
guesses that only Mr. Hindley would be up; and he'd rather avoid having
the door opened by the master.'

'Nay, nay, he's noan at Gimmerton,' said Joseph.  'I's niver wonder but
he's at t' bothom of a bog-hoile.  This visitation worn't for nowt, and I
wod hev' ye to look out, Miss--yah muh be t' next.  Thank Hivin for all!
All warks togither for gooid to them as is chozzen, and piked out fro'
th' rubbidge!  Yah knaw whet t' Scripture ses.'  And he began quoting
several texts, referring us to chapters and verses where we might find
them.

I, having vainly begged the wilful girl to rise and remove her wet
things, left him preaching and her shivering, and betook myself to bed
with little Hareton, who slept as fast as if everyone had been sleeping
round him.  I heard Joseph read on a while afterwards; then I
distinguished his slow step on the ladder, and then I dropped asleep.

Coming down somewhat later than usual, I saw, by the sunbeams piercing
the chinks of the shutters, Miss Catherine still seated near the
fireplace.  The house-door was ajar, too; light entered from its unclosed
windows; Hindley had come out, and stood on the kitchen hearth, haggard
and drowsy.

'What ails you, Cathy?' he was saying when I entered: 'you look as dismal
as a drowned whelp.  Why are you so damp and pale, child?'

'I've been wet,' she answered reluctantly, 'and I'm cold, that's all.'

'Oh, she is naughty!' I cried, perceiving the master to be tolerably
sober.  'She got steeped in the shower of yesterday evening, and there
she has sat the night through, and I couldn't prevail on her to stir.'

Mr. Earnshaw stared at us in surprise.  'The night through,' he repeated.
'What kept her up? not fear of the thunder, surely?  That was over hours
since.'

Neither of us wished to mention Heathcliff's absence, as long as we could
conceal it; so I replied, I didn't know how she took it into her head to
sit up; and she said nothing.  The morning was fresh and cool; I threw
back the lattice, and presently the room filled with sweet scents from
the garden; but Catherine called peevishly to me, 'Ellen, shut the
window.  I'm starving!'  And her teeth chattered as she shrank closer to
the almost extinguished embers.

'She's ill,' said Hindley, taking her wrist; 'I suppose that's the reason
she would not go to bed.  Damn it!  I don't want to be troubled with more
sickness here.  What took you into the rain?'

'Running after t' lads, as usuald!' croaked Joseph, catching an
opportunity from our hesitation to thrust in his evil tongue.  'If I war
yah, maister, I'd just slam t' boards i' their faces all on 'em, gentle
and simple!  Never a day ut yah're off, but yon cat o' Linton comes
sneaking hither; and Miss Nelly, shoo's a fine lass! shoo sits watching
for ye i' t' kitchen; and as yah're in at one door, he's out at t'other;
and, then, wer grand lady goes a-courting of her side!  It's bonny
behaviour, lurking amang t' fields, after twelve o' t' night, wi' that
fahl, flaysome divil of a gipsy, Heathcliff!  They think _I'm_ blind; but
I'm noan: nowt ut t' soart!--I seed young Linton boath coming and going,
and I seed _yah_' (directing his discourse to me), 'yah gooid fur nowt,
slattenly witch! nip up and bolt into th' house, t' minute yah heard t'
maister's horse-fit clatter up t' road.'

'Silence, eavesdropper!' cried Catherine; 'none of your insolence before
me!  Edgar Linton came yesterday by chance, Hindley; and it was _I_ who
told him to be off: because I knew you would not like to have met him as
you were.'

'You lie, Cathy, no doubt,' answered her brother, 'and you are a
confounded simpleton!  But never mind Linton at present: tell me, were
you not with Heathcliff last night?  Speak the truth, now.  You need not
be afraid of harming him: though I hate him as much as ever, he did me a
good turn a short time since that will make my conscience tender of
breaking his neck.  To prevent it, I shall send him about his business
this very morning; and after he's gone, I'd advise you all to look sharp:
I shall only have the more humour for you.'

'I never saw Heathcliff last night,' answered Catherine, beginning to sob
bitterly: 'and if you do turn him out of doors, I'll go with him.  But,
perhaps, you'll never have an opportunity: perhaps, he's gone.'  Here she
burst into uncontrollable grief, and the remainder of her words were
inarticulate.

Hindley lavished on her a torrent of scornful abuse, and bade her get to
her room immediately, or she shouldn't cry for nothing!  I obliged her to
obey; and I shall never forget what a scene she acted when we reached her
chamber: it terrified me.  I thought she was going mad, and I begged
Joseph to run for the doctor.  It proved the commencement of delirium:
Mr. Kenneth, as soon as he saw her, pronounced her dangerously ill; she
had a fever.  He bled her, and he told me to let her live on whey and
water-gruel, and take care she did not throw herself downstairs or out of
the window; and then he left: for he had enough to do in the parish,
where two or three miles was the ordinary distance between cottage and
cottage.

Though I cannot say I made a gentle nurse, and Joseph and the master were
no better, and though our patient was as wearisome and headstrong as a
patient could be, she weathered it through.  Old Mrs. Linton paid us
several visits, to be sure, and set things to rights, and scolded and
ordered us all; and when Catherine was convalescent, she insisted on
conveying her to Thrushcross Grange: for which deliverance we were very
grateful.  But the poor dame had reason to repent of her kindness: she
and her husband both took the fever, and died within a few days of each
other.

Our young lady returned to us saucier and more passionate, and haughtier
than ever.  Heathcliff had never been heard of since the evening of the
thunder-storm; and, one day, I had the misfortune, when she had provoked
me exceedingly, to lay the blame of his disappearance on her: where
indeed it belonged, as she well knew.  From that period, for several
months, she ceased to hold any communication with me, save in the
relation of a mere servant.  Joseph fell under a ban also: he would speak
his mind, and lecture her all the same as if she were a little girl; and
she esteemed herself a woman, and our mistress, and thought that her
recent illness gave her a claim to be treated with consideration.  Then
the doctor had said that she would not bear crossing much; she ought to
have her own way; and it was nothing less than murder in her eyes for any
one to presume to stand up and contradict her.  From Mr. Earnshaw and his
companions she kept aloof; and tutored by Kenneth, and serious threats of
a fit that often attended her rages, her brother allowed her whatever she
pleased to demand, and generally avoided aggravating her fiery temper.  He
was rather too indulgent in humouring her caprices; not from affection,
but from pride: he wished earnestly to see her bring honour to the family
by an alliance with the Lintons, and as long as she let him alone she
might trample on us like slaves, for aught he cared!  Edgar Linton, as
multitudes have been before and will be after him, was infatuated: and
believed himself the happiest man alive on the day he led her to
Gimmerton Chapel, three years subsequent to his father's death.

Much against my inclination, I was persuaded to leave Wuthering Heights
and accompany her here. Little Hareton was nearly five years old, and I
had just begun to teach him his letters.  We made a sad parting; but
Catherine's tears were more powerful than ours.  When I refused to go,
and when she found her entreaties did not move me, she went lamenting to
her husband and brother.  The former offered me munificent wages; the
latter ordered me to pack up: he wanted no women in the house, he said,
now that there was no mistress; and as to Hareton, the curate should take
him in hand, by-and-by.  And so I had but one choice left: to do as I was
ordered.  I told the master he got rid of all decent people only to run
to ruin a little faster; I kissed Hareton, said good-by; and since then
he has been a stranger: and it's very queer to think it, but I've no
doubt he has completely forgotten all about Ellen Dean, and that he was
ever more than all the world to her and she to him!

* * * * *

At this point of the housekeeper's story she chanced to glance towards
the time-piece over the chimney; and was in amazement on seeing the
minute-hand measure half-past one.  She would not hear of staying a
second longer: in truth, I felt rather disposed to defer the sequel of
her narrative myself.  And now that she is vanished to her rest, and I
have meditated for another hour or two, I shall summon courage to go
also, in spite of aching laziness of head and limbs.




CHAPTER X


A charming introduction to a hermit's life!  Four weeks' torture,
tossing, and sickness!  Oh, these bleak winds and bitter northern skies,
and impassable roads, and dilatory country surgeons!  And oh, this dearth
of the human physiognomy! and, worse than all, the terrible intimation of
Kenneth that I need not expect to be out of doors till spring!

Mr. Heathcliff has just honoured me with a call.  About seven days ago he
sent me a brace of grouse--the last of the season.  Scoundrel!  He is not
altogether guiltless in this illness of mine; and that I had a great mind
to tell him.  But, alas! how could I offend a man who was charitable
enough to sit at my bedside a good hour, and talk on some other subject
than pills and draughts, blisters and leeches?  This is quite an easy
interval.  I am too weak to read; yet I feel as if I could enjoy
something interesting.  Why not have up Mrs. Dean to finish her tale?  I
can recollect its chief incidents, as far as she had gone.  Yes: I
remember her hero had run off, and never been heard of for three years;
and the heroine was married.  I'll ring: she'll be delighted to find me
capable of talking cheerfully.  Mrs. Dean came.

'It wants twenty minutes, sir, to taking the medicine,' she commenced.

'Away, away with it!' I replied; 'I desire to have--'

'The doctor says you must drop the powders.'

'With all my heart!  Don't interrupt me.  Come and take your seat here.
Keep your fingers from that bitter phalanx of vials.  Draw your knitting
out of your pocket--that will do--now continue the history of Mr.
Heathcliff, from where you left off, to the present day.  Did he finish
his education on the Continent, and come back a gentleman? or did he get
a sizar's place at college, or escape to America, and earn honours by
drawing blood from his foster-country? or make a fortune more promptly on
the English highways?'

'He may have done a little in all these vocations, Mr. Lockwood; but I
couldn't give my word for any.  I stated before that I didn't know how he
gained his money; neither am I aware of the means he took to raise his
mind from the savage ignorance into which it was sunk: but, with your
leave, I'll proceed in my own fashion, if you think it will amuse and not
weary you.  Are you feeling better this morning?'

'Much.'

'That's good news.'

* * * * *

I got Miss Catherine and myself to Thrushcross Grange; and, to my
agreeable disappointment, she behaved infinitely better than I dared to
expect.  She seemed almost over-fond of Mr. Linton; and even to his
sister she showed plenty of affection.  They were both very attentive to
her comfort, certainly.  It was not the thorn bending to the
honeysuckles, but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn.  There were no
mutual concessions: one stood erect, and the others yielded: and who can
be ill-natured and bad-tempered when they encounter neither opposition
nor indifference?  I observed that Mr. Edgar had a deep-rooted fear of
ruffling her humour.  He concealed it from her; but if ever he heard me
answer sharply, or saw any other servant grow cloudy at some imperious
order of hers, he would show his trouble by a frown of displeasure that
never darkened on his own account.  He many a time spoke sternly to me
about my pertness; and averred that the stab of a knife could not inflict
a worse pang than he suffered at seeing his lady vexed.  Not to grieve a
kind master, I learned to be less touchy; and, for the space of half a
year, the gunpowder lay as harmless as sand, because no fire came near to
explode it.  Catherine had seasons of gloom and silence now and then:
they were respected with sympathising silence by her husband, who
ascribed them to an alteration in her constitution, produced by her
perilous illness; as she was never subject to depression of spirits
before.  The return of sunshine was welcomed by answering sunshine from
him.  I believe I may assert that they were really in possession of deep
and growing happiness.

It ended.  Well, we _must_ be for ourselves in the long run; the mild and
generous are only more justly selfish than the domineering; and it ended
when circumstances caused each to feel that the one's interest was not
the chief consideration in the other's thoughts.  On a mellow evening in
September, I was coming from the garden with a heavy basket of apples
which I had been gathering.  It had got dusk, and the moon looked over
the high wall of the court, causing undefined shadows to lurk in the
corners of the numerous projecting portions of the building.  I set my
burden on the house-steps by the kitchen-door, and lingered to rest, and
drew in a few more breaths of the soft, sweet air; my eyes were on the
moon, and my back to the entrance, when I heard a voice behind me
say,--'Nelly, is that you?'

It was a deep voice, and foreign in tone; yet there was something in the
manner of pronouncing my name which made it sound familiar.  I turned
about to discover who spoke, fearfully; for the doors were shut, and I
had seen nobody on approaching the steps.  Something stirred in the
porch; and, moving nearer, I distinguished a tall man dressed in dark
clothes, with dark face and hair.  He leant against the side, and held
his fingers on the latch as if intending to open for himself.  'Who can
it be?' I thought.  'Mr. Earnshaw?  Oh, no!  The voice has no resemblance
to his.'

'I have waited here an hour,' he resumed, while I continued staring; 'and
the whole of that time all round has been as still as death.  I dared not
enter.  You do not know me?  Look, I'm not a stranger!'

A ray fell on his features; the cheeks were sallow, and half covered with
black whiskers; the brows lowering, the eyes deep-set and singular.  I
remembered the eyes.

'What!' I cried, uncertain whether to regard him as a worldly visitor,
and I raised my hands in amazement.  'What! you come back?  Is it really
you?  Is it?'

'Yes, Heathcliff,' he replied, glancing from me up to the windows, which
reflected a score of glittering moons, but showed no lights from within.
'Are they at home? where is she?  Nelly, you are not glad! you needn't be
so disturbed.  Is she here?  Speak!  I want to have one word with
her--your mistress.  Go, and say some person from Gimmerton desires to
see her.'

'How will she take it?' I exclaimed.  'What will she do?  The surprise
bewilders me--it will put her out of her head!  And you _are_ Heathcliff!
But altered!  Nay, there's no comprehending it.  Have you been for a
soldier?'

'Go and carry my message,' he interrupted, impatiently.  'I'm in hell
till you do!'

He lifted the latch, and I entered; but when I got to the parlour where
Mr. and Mrs. Linton were, I could not persuade myself to proceed.  At
length I resolved on making an excuse to ask if they would have the
candles lighted, and I opened the door.

They sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall,
and displayed, beyond the garden trees, and the wild green park, the
valley of Gimmerton, with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top
(for very soon after you pass the chapel, as you may have noticed, the
sough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of
the glen).  Wuthering Heights rose above this silvery vapour; but our old
house was invisible; it rather dips down on the other side.  Both the
room and its occupants, and the scene they gazed on, looked wondrously
peaceful.  I shrank reluctantly from performing my errand; and was
actually going away leaving it unsaid, after having put my question about
the candles, when a sense of my folly compelled me to return, and mutter,
'A person from Gimmerton wishes to see you ma'am.'

'What does he want?' asked Mrs. Linton.

'I did not question him,' I answered.

'Well, close the curtains, Nelly,' she said; 'and bring up tea.  I'll be
back again directly.'

She quitted the apartment; Mr. Edgar inquired, carelessly, who it was.

'Some one mistress does not expect,' I replied.  'That Heathcliff--you
recollect him, sir--who used to live at Mr. Earnshaw's.'

'What! the gipsy--the ploughboy?' he cried.  'Why did you not say so to
Catherine?'

'Hush! you must not call him by those names, master,' I said.  'She'd be
sadly grieved to hear you.  She was nearly heartbroken when he ran off.  I
guess his return will make a jubilee to her.'

Mr. Linton walked to a window on the other side of the room that
overlooked the court.  He unfastened it, and leant out.  I suppose they
were below, for he exclaimed quickly: 'Don't stand there, love!  Bring
the person in, if it be anyone particular.'  Ere long, I heard the click
of the latch, and Catherine flew up-stairs, breathless and wild; too
excited to show gladness: indeed, by her face, you would rather have
surmised an awful calamity.

'Oh, Edgar, Edgar!' she panted, flinging her arms round his neck.  'Oh,
Edgar darling!  Heathcliff's come back--he is!'  And she tightened her
embrace to a squeeze.

'Well, well,' cried her husband, crossly, 'don't strangle me for that!  He
never struck me as such a marvellous treasure.  There is no need to be
frantic!'

'I know you didn't like him,' she answered, repressing a little the
intensity of her delight.  'Yet, for my sake, you must be friends now.
Shall I tell him to come up?'

'Here,' he said, 'into the parlour?'

'Where else?' she asked.

He looked vexed, and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable place for
him.  Mrs. Linton eyed him with a droll expression--half angry, half
laughing at his fastidiousness.

'No,' she added, after a while; 'I cannot sit in the kitchen.  Set two
tables here, Ellen: one for your master and Miss Isabella, being gentry;
the other for Heathcliff and myself, being of the lower orders.  Will
that please you, dear?  Or must I have a fire lighted elsewhere?  If so,
give directions.  I'll run down and secure my guest.  I'm afraid the joy
is too great to be real!'

She was about to dart off again; but Edgar arrested her.

'_You_ bid him step up,' he said, addressing me; 'and, Catherine, try to
be glad, without being absurd.  The whole household need not witness the
sight of your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother.'

I descended, and found Heathcliff waiting under the porch, evidently
anticipating an invitation to enter.  He followed my guidance without
waste of words, and I ushered him into the presence of the master and
mistress, whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm talking.  But the
lady's glowed with another feeling when her friend appeared at the door:
she sprang forward, took both his hands, and led him to Linton; and then
she seized Linton's reluctant fingers and crushed them into his.  Now,
fully revealed by the fire and candlelight, I was amazed, more than ever,
to behold the transformation of Heathcliff.  He had grown a tall,
athletic, well-formed man; beside whom my master seemed quite slender and
youth-like.  His upright carriage suggested the idea of his having been
in the army.  His countenance was much older in expression and decision
of feature than Mr. Linton's; it looked intelligent, and retained no
marks of former degradation.  A half-civilised ferocity lurked yet in the
depressed brows and eyes full of black fire, but it was subdued; and his
manner was even dignified: quite divested of roughness, though stern for
grace.  My master's surprise equalled or exceeded mine: he remained for a
minute at a loss how to address the ploughboy, as he had called him.
Heathcliff dropped his slight hand, and stood looking at him coolly till
he chose to speak.

'Sit down, sir,' he said, at length.  'Mrs. Linton, recalling old times,
would have me give you a cordial reception; and, of course, I am
gratified when anything occurs to please her.'

'And I also,' answered Heathcliff, 'especially if it be anything in which
I have a part.  I shall stay an hour or two willingly.'

He took a seat opposite Catherine, who kept her gaze fixed on him as if
she feared he would vanish were she to remove it.  He did not raise his
to her often: a quick glance now and then sufficed; but it flashed back,
each time more confidently, the undisguised delight he drank from hers.
They were too much absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer embarrassment.
Not so Mr. Edgar: he grew pale with pure annoyance: a feeling that
reached its climax when his lady rose, and stepping across the rug,
seized Heathcliff's hands again, and laughed like one beside herself.

'I shall think it a dream to-morrow!' she cried.  'I shall not be able to
believe that I have seen, and touched, and spoken to you once more.  And
yet, cruel Heathcliff! you don't deserve this welcome.  To be absent and
silent for three years, and never to think of me!'

'A little more than you have thought of me,' he murmured.  'I heard of
your marriage, Cathy, not long since; and, while waiting in the yard
below, I meditated this plan--just to have one glimpse of your face, a
stare of surprise, perhaps, and pretended pleasure; afterwards settle my
score with Hindley; and then prevent the law by doing execution on
myself.  Your welcome has put these ideas out of my mind; but beware of
meeting me with another aspect next time!  Nay, you'll not drive me off
again.  You were really sorry for me, were you?  Well, there was cause.
I've fought through a bitter life since I last heard your voice; and you
must forgive me, for I struggled only for you!'

'Catherine, unless we are to have cold tea, please to come to the table,'
interrupted Linton, striving to preserve his ordinary tone, and a due
measure of politeness.  'Mr. Heathcliff will have a long walk, wherever
he may lodge to-night; and I'm thirsty.'

She took her post before the urn; and Miss Isabella came, summoned by the
bell; then, having handed their chairs forward, I left the room.  The
meal hardly endured ten minutes.  Catherine's cup was never filled: she
could neither eat nor drink.  Edgar had made a slop in his saucer, and
scarcely swallowed a mouthful.  Their guest did not protract his stay
that evening above an hour longer.  I asked, as he departed, if he went
to Gimmerton?

'No, to Wuthering Heights,' he answered: 'Mr. Earnshaw invited me, when I
called this morning.'

Mr. Earnshaw invited _him_! and _he_ called on Mr. Earnshaw!  I pondered
this sentence painfully, after he was gone.  Is he turning out a bit of a
hypocrite, and coming into the country to work mischief under a cloak?  I
mused: I had a presentiment in the bottom of my heart that he had better
have remained away.

About the middle of the night, I was wakened from my first nap by Mrs.
Linton gliding into my chamber, taking a seat on my bedside, and pulling
me by the hair to rouse me.

'I cannot rest, Ellen,' she said, by way of apology.  'And I want some
living creature to keep me company in my happiness!  Edgar is sulky,
because I'm glad of a thing that does not interest him: he refuses to
open his mouth, except to utter pettish, silly speeches; and he affirmed
I was cruel and selfish for wishing to talk when he was so sick and
sleepy.  He always contrives to be sick at the least cross!  I gave a few
sentences of commendation to Heathcliff, and he, either for a headache or
a pang of envy, began to cry: so I got up and left him.'

'What use is it praising Heathcliff to him?' I answered.  'As lads they
had an aversion to each other, and Heathcliff would hate just as much to
hear him praised: it's human nature.  Let Mr. Linton alone about him,
unless you would like an open quarrel between them.'

'But does it not show great weakness?' pursued she.  'I'm not envious: I
never feel hurt at the brightness of Isabella's yellow hair and the
whiteness of her skin, at her dainty elegance, and the fondness all the
family exhibit for her.  Even you, Nelly, if we have a dispute sometimes,
you back Isabella at once; and I yield like a foolish mother: I call her
a darling, and flatter her into a good temper.  It pleases her brother to
see us cordial, and that pleases me.  But they are very much alike: they
are spoiled children, and fancy the world was made for their
accommodation; and though I humour both, I think a smart chastisement
might improve them all the same.'

'You're mistaken, Mrs. Linton,' said I.  'They humour you: I know what
there would be to do if they did not.  You can well afford to indulge
their passing whims as long as their business is to anticipate all your
desires.  You may, however, fall out, at last, over something of equal
consequence to both sides; and then those you term weak are very capable
of being as obstinate as you.'

'And then we shall fight to the death, sha'n't we, Nelly?' she returned,
laughing.  'No! I tell you, I have such faith in Linton's love, that I
believe I might kill him, and he wouldn't wish to retaliate.'

I advised her to value him the more for his affection.

'I do,' she answered, 'but he needn't resort to whining for trifles.  It
is childish and, instead of melting into tears because I said that
Heathcliff was now worthy of anyone's regard, and it would honour the
first gentleman in the country to be his friend, he ought to have said it
for me, and been delighted from sympathy.  He must get accustomed to him,
and he may as well like him: considering how Heathcliff has reason to
object to him, I'm sure he behaved excellently!'

'What do you think of his going to Wuthering Heights?' I inquired.  'He
is reformed in every respect, apparently: quite a Christian: offering the
right hand of fellowship to his enemies all around!'

'He explained it,' she replied.  'I wonder as much as you.  He said he
called to gather information concerning me from you, supposing you
resided there still; and Joseph told Hindley, who came out and fell to
questioning him of what he had been doing, and how he had been living;
and finally, desired him to walk in.  There were some persons sitting at
cards; Heathcliff joined them; my brother lost some money to him, and,
finding him plentifully supplied, he requested that he would come again
in the evening: to which he consented.  Hindley is too reckless to select
his acquaintance prudently: he doesn't trouble himself to reflect on the
causes he might have for mistrusting one whom he has basely injured.  But
Heathcliff affirms his principal reason for resuming a connection with
his ancient persecutor is a wish to install himself in quarters at walking
distance from the Grange, and an attachment to the house where we lived
together; and likewise a hope that I shall have more opportunities of
seeing him there than I could have if he settled in Gimmerton.  He means
to offer liberal payment for permission to lodge at the Heights; and
doubtless my brother's covetousness will prompt him to accept the terms:
he was always greedy; though what he grasps with one hand he flings away
with the other.'

'It's a nice place for a young man to fix his dwelling in!' said I.  'Have
you no fear of the consequences, Mrs. Linton?'

'None for my friend,' she replied: 'his strong head will keep him from
danger; a little for Hindley: but he can't be made morally worse than he
is; and I stand between him and bodily harm.  The event of this evening
has reconciled me to God and humanity!  I had risen in angry rebellion
against Providence.  Oh, I've endured very, very bitter misery, Nelly!  If
that creature knew how bitter, he'd be ashamed to cloud its removal with
idle petulance.  It was kindness for him which induced me to bear it
alone: had I expressed the agony I frequently felt, he would have been
taught to long for its alleviation as ardently as I.  However, it's over,
and I'll take no revenge on his folly; I can afford to suffer anything
hereafter!  Should the meanest thing alive slap me on the cheek, I'd not
only turn the other, but I'd ask pardon for provoking it; and, as a
proof, I'll go make my peace with Edgar instantly.  Good-night!  I'm an
angel!'

In this self-complacent conviction she departed; and the success of her
fulfilled resolution was obvious on the morrow: Mr. Linton had not only
abjured his peevishness (though his spirits seemed still subdued by
Catherine's exuberance of vivacity), but he ventured no objection to her
taking Isabella with her to Wuthering Heights in the afternoon; and she
rewarded him with such a summer of sweetness and affection in return as
made the house a paradise for several days; both master and servants
profiting from the perpetual sunshine.

Heathcliff--Mr. Heathcliff I should say in future--used the liberty of
visiting at Thrushcross Grange cautiously, at first: he seemed estimating
how far its owner would bear his intrusion.  Catherine, also, deemed it
judicious to moderate her expressions of pleasure in receiving him; and
he gradually established his right to be expected.  He retained a great
deal of the reserve for which his boyhood was remarkable; and that served
to repress all startling demonstrations of feeling.  My master's
uneasiness experienced a lull, and further circumstances diverted it into
another channel for a space.

His new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated misfortune of
Isabella Linton evincing a sudden and irresistible attraction towards the
tolerated guest.  She was at that time a charming young lady of eighteen;
infantile in manners, though possessed of keen wit, keen feelings, and a
keen temper, too, if irritated.  Her brother, who loved her tenderly, was
appalled at this fantastic preference.  Leaving aside the degradation of
an alliance with a nameless man, and the possible fact that his property,
in default of heirs male, might pass into such a one's power, he had
sense to comprehend Heathcliff's disposition: to know that, though his
exterior was altered, his mind was unchangeable and unchanged.  And he
dreaded that mind: it revolted him: he shrank forebodingly from the idea
of committing Isabella to its keeping.  He would have recoiled still more
had he been aware that her attachment rose unsolicited, and was bestowed
where it awakened no reciprocation of sentiment; for the minute he
discovered its existence he laid the blame on Heathcliff's deliberate
designing.

We had all remarked, during some time, that Miss Linton fretted and pined
over something.  She grew cross and wearisome; snapping at and teasing
Catherine continually, at the imminent risk of exhausting her limited
patience.  We excused her, to a certain extent, on the plea of
ill-health: she was dwindling and fading before our eyes.  But one day,
when she had been peculiarly wayward, rejecting her breakfast,
complaining that the servants did not do what she told them; that the
mistress would allow her to be nothing in the house, and Edgar neglected
her; that she had caught a cold with the doors being left open, and we
let the parlour fire go out on purpose to vex her, with a hundred yet
more frivolous accusations, Mrs. Linton peremptorily insisted that she
should get to bed; and, having scolded her heartily, threatened to send
for the doctor.  Mention of Kenneth caused her to exclaim, instantly,
that her health was perfect, and it was only Catherine's harshness which
made her unhappy.

'How can you say I am harsh, you naughty fondling?' cried the mistress,
amazed at the unreasonable assertion.  'You are surely losing your
reason.  When have I been harsh, tell me?'

'Yesterday,' sobbed Isabella, 'and now!'

'Yesterday!' said her sister-in-law.  'On what occasion?'

'In our walk along the moor: you told me to ramble where I pleased, while
you sauntered on with Mr. Heathcliff!'

'And that's your notion of harshness?' said Catherine, laughing.  'It was
no hint that your company was superfluous?  We didn't care whether you
kept with us or not; I merely thought Heathcliff's talk would have
nothing entertaining for your ears.'

'Oh, no,' wept the young lady; 'you wished me away, because you knew I
liked to be there!'

'Is she sane?' asked Mrs. Linton, appealing to me.  'I'll repeat our
conversation, word for word, Isabella; and you point out any charm it
could have had for you.'

'I don't mind the conversation,' she answered: 'I wanted to be with--'

'Well?' said Catherine, perceiving her hesitate to complete the sentence.

'With him: and I won't be always sent off!' she continued, kindling up.
'You are a dog in the manger, Cathy, and desire no one to be loved but
yourself!'

'You are an impertinent little monkey!' exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in
surprise.  'But I'll not believe this idiotcy!  It is impossible that you
can covet the admiration of Heathcliff--that you consider him an
agreeable person!  I hope I have misunderstood you, Isabella?'

'No, you have not,' said the infatuated girl.  'I love him more than ever
you loved Edgar, and he might love me, if you would let him!'

'I wouldn't be you for a kingdom, then!' Catherine declared,
emphatically: and she seemed to speak sincerely.  'Nelly, help me to
convince her of her madness.  Tell her what Heathcliff is: an unreclaimed
creature, without refinement, without cultivation; an arid wilderness of
furze and whinstone.  I'd as soon put that little canary into the park on
a winter's day, as recommend you to bestow your heart on him!  It is
deplorable ignorance of his character, child, and nothing else, which
makes that dream enter your head.  Pray, don't imagine that he conceals
depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern exterior!  He's not a
rough diamond--a pearl-containing oyster of a rustic: he's a fierce,
pitiless, wolfish man.  I never say to him, "Let this or that enemy
alone, because it would be ungenerous or cruel to harm them;" I say, "Let
them alone, because _I_ should hate them to be wronged:" and he'd crush
you like a sparrow's egg, Isabella, if he found you a troublesome charge.
I know he couldn't love a Linton; and yet he'd be quite capable of
marrying your fortune and expectations: avarice is growing with him a
besetting sin.  There's my picture: and I'm his friend--so much so, that
had he thought seriously to catch you, I should, perhaps, have held my
tongue, and let you fall into his trap.'

Miss Linton regarded her sister-in-law with indignation.

'For shame! for shame!' she repeated, angrily.  'You are worse than
twenty foes, you poisonous friend!'

'Ah! you won't believe me, then?' said Catherine.  'You think I speak
from wicked selfishness?'

'I'm certain you do,' retorted Isabella; 'and I shudder at you!'

'Good!' cried the other.  'Try for yourself, if that be your spirit: I
have done, and yield the argument to your saucy insolence.'--

'And I must suffer for her egotism!' she sobbed, as Mrs. Linton left the
room.  'All, all is against me: she has blighted my single consolation.
But she uttered falsehoods, didn't she?  Mr. Heathcliff is not a fiend:
he has an honourable soul, and a true one, or how could he remember her?'

'Banish him from your thoughts, Miss,' I said.  'He's a bird of bad omen:
no mate for you.  Mrs. Linton spoke strongly, and yet I can't contradict
her.  She is better acquainted with his heart than I, or any one besides;
and she never would represent him as worse than he is.  Honest people
don't hide their deeds.  How has he been living? how has he got rich? why
is he staying at Wuthering Heights, the house of a man whom he abhors?
They say Mr. Earnshaw is worse and worse since he came.  They sit up all
night together continually, and Hindley has been borrowing money on his
land, and does nothing but play and drink: I heard only a week ago--it
was Joseph who told me--I met him at Gimmerton: "Nelly," he said, "we's
hae a crowner's 'quest enow, at ahr folks'.  One on 'em 's a'most getten
his finger cut off wi' hauding t' other fro' stickin' hisseln loike a
cawlf.  That's maister, yeah knaw, 'at 's soa up o' going tuh t' grand
'sizes.  He's noan feared o' t' bench o' judges, norther Paul, nur Peter,
nur John, nur Matthew, nor noan on 'em, not he!  He fair likes--he langs
to set his brazened face agean 'em!  And yon bonny lad Heathcliff, yah
mind, he's a rare 'un.  He can girn a laugh as well 's onybody at a
raight divil's jest.  Does he niver say nowt of his fine living amang us,
when he goes to t' Grange?  This is t' way on 't:--up at sun-down: dice,
brandy, cloised shutters, und can'le-light till next day at noon: then,
t'fooil gangs banning und raving to his cham'er, makking dacent fowks dig
thur fingers i' thur lugs fur varry shame; un' the knave, why he can
caint his brass, un' ate, un' sleep, un' off to his neighbour's to gossip
wi' t' wife.  I' course, he tells Dame Catherine how her fathur's goold
runs into his pocket, and her fathur's son gallops down t' broad road,
while he flees afore to oppen t' pikes!"  Now, Miss Linton, Joseph is an
old rascal, but no liar; and, if his account of Heathcliff's conduct be
true, you would never think of desiring such a husband, would you?'

'You are leagued with the rest, Ellen!' she replied.  'I'll not listen to
your slanders.  What malevolence you must have to wish to convince me
that there is no happiness in the world!'

Whether she would have got over this fancy if left to herself, or
persevered in nursing it perpetually, I cannot say: she had little time
to reflect.  The day after, there was a justice-meeting at the next town;
my master was obliged to attend; and Mr. Heathcliff, aware of his
absence, called rather earlier than usual.  Catherine and Isabella were
sitting in the library, on hostile terms, but silent: the latter alarmed
at her recent indiscretion, and the disclosure she had made of her secret
feelings in a transient fit of passion; the former, on mature
consideration, really offended with her companion; and, if she laughed
again at her pertness, inclined to make it no laughing matter to her.  She
did laugh as she saw Heathcliff pass the window.  I was sweeping the
hearth, and I noticed a mischievous smile on her lips.  Isabella,
absorbed in her meditations, or a book, remained till the door opened;
and it was too late to attempt an escape, which she would gladly have
done had it been practicable.

'Come in, that's right!' exclaimed the mistress, gaily, pulling a chair
to the fire.  'Here are two people sadly in need of a third to thaw the
ice between them; and you are the very one we should both of us choose.
Heathcliff, I'm proud to show you, at last, somebody that dotes on you
more than myself.  I expect you to feel flattered.  Nay, it's not Nelly;
don't look at her!  My poor little sister-in-law is breaking her heart by
mere contemplation of your physical and moral beauty.  It lies in your
own power to be Edgar's brother!  No, no, Isabella, you sha'n't run off,'
she continued, arresting, with feigned playfulness, the confounded girl,
who had risen indignantly.  'We were quarrelling like cats about you,
Heathcliff; and I was fairly beaten in protestations of devotion and
admiration: and, moreover, I was informed that if I would but have the
manners to stand aside, my rival, as she will have herself to be, would
shoot a shaft into your soul that would fix you for ever, and send my
image into eternal oblivion!'

'Catherine!' said Isabella, calling up her dignity, and disdaining to
struggle from the tight grasp that held her, 'I'd thank you to adhere to
the truth and not slander me, even in joke!  Mr. Heathcliff, be kind
enough to bid this friend of yours release me: she forgets that you and I
are not intimate acquaintances; and what amuses her is painful to me
beyond expression.'

As the guest answered nothing, but took his seat, and looked thoroughly
indifferent what sentiments she cherished concerning him, she turned and
whispered an earnest appeal for liberty to her tormentor.

'By no means!' cried Mrs. Linton in answer.  'I won't be named a dog in
the manger again.  You _shall_ stay: now then!  Heathcliff, why don't you
evince satisfaction at my pleasant news?  Isabella swears that the love
Edgar has for me is nothing to that she entertains for you.  I'm sure she
made some speech of the kind; did she not, Ellen?  And she has fasted
ever since the day before yesterday's walk, from sorrow and rage that I
despatched her out of your society under the idea of its being
unacceptable.'

'I think you belie her,' said Heathcliff, twisting his chair to face
them.  'She wishes to be out of my society now, at any rate!'

And he stared hard at the object of discourse, as one might do at a
strange repulsive animal: a centipede from the Indies, for instance,
which curiosity leads one to examine in spite of the aversion it raises.
The poor thing couldn't bear that; she grew white and red in rapid
succession, and, while tears beaded her lashes, bent the strength of her
small fingers to loosen the firm clutch of Catherine; and perceiving that
as fast as she raised one finger off her arm another closed down, and she
could not remove the whole together, she began to make use of her nails;
and their sharpness presently ornamented the detainer's with crescents of
red.

'There's a tigress!' exclaimed Mrs. Linton, setting her free, and shaking
her hand with pain.  'Begone, for God's sake, and hide your vixen face!
How foolish to reveal those talons to him.  Can't you fancy the
conclusions he'll draw?  Look, Heathcliff! they are instruments that will
do execution--you must beware of your eyes.'

'I'd wrench them off her fingers, if they ever menaced me,' he answered,
brutally, when the door had closed after her.  'But what did you mean by
teasing the creature in that manner, Cathy?  You were not speaking the
truth, were you?'

'I assure you I was,' she returned.  'She has been dying for your sake
several weeks, and raving about you this morning, and pouring forth a
deluge of abuse, because I represented your failings in a plain light,
for the purpose of mitigating her adoration.  But don't notice it
further: I wished to punish her sauciness, that's all.  I like her too
well, my dear Heathcliff, to let you absolutely seize and devour her up.'

'And I like her too ill to attempt it,' said he, 'except in a very
ghoulish fashion.  You'd hear of odd things if I lived alone with that
mawkish, waxen face: the most ordinary would be painting on its white the
colours of the rainbow, and turning the blue eyes black, every day or
two: they detestably resemble Linton's.'

'Delectably!' observed Catherine.  'They are dove's eyes--angel's!'

'She's her brother's heir, is she not?' he asked, after a brief silence.

'I should be sorry to think so,' returned his companion.  'Half a dozen
nephews shall erase her title, please heaven!  Abstract your mind from
the subject at present: you are too prone to covet your neighbour's
goods; remember _this_ neighbour's goods are mine.'

'If they were _mine_, they would be none the less that,' said Heathcliff;
'but though Isabella Linton may be silly, she is scarcely mad; and, in
short, we'll dismiss the matter, as you advise.'

From their tongues they did dismiss it; and Catherine, probably, from her
thoughts.  The other, I felt certain, recalled it often in the course of
the evening.  I saw him smile to himself--grin rather--and lapse into
ominous musing whenever Mrs. Linton had occasion to be absent from the
apartment.

I determined to watch his movements.  My heart invariably cleaved to the
master's, in preference to Catherine's side: with reason I imagined, for
he was kind, and trustful, and honourable; and she--she could not be
called _opposite_, yet she seemed to allow herself such wide latitude,
that I had little faith in her principles, and still less sympathy for
her feelings.  I wanted something to happen which might have the effect
of freeing both Wuthering Heights and the Grange of Mr. Heathcliff
quietly; leaving us as we had been prior to his advent.  His visits were
a continual nightmare to me; and, I suspected, to my master also.  His
abode at the Heights was an oppression past explaining.  I felt that God
had forsaken the stray sheep there to its own wicked wanderings, and an
evil beast prowled between it and the fold, waiting his time to spring
and destroy.




CHAPTER XI


Sometimes, while meditating on these things in solitude, I've got up in a
sudden terror, and put on my bonnet to go see how all was at the farm.
I've persuaded my conscience that it was a duty to warn him how people
talked regarding his ways; and then I've recollected his confirmed bad
habits, and, hopeless of benefiting him, have flinched from re-entering
the dismal house, doubting if I could bear to be taken at my word.

One time I passed the old gate, going out of my way, on a journey to
Gimmerton. It was about the period that my narrative has reached: a
bright frosty afternoon; the ground bare, and the road hard and dry. I
came to a stone where the highway branches off on to the moor at your
left hand; a rough sand-pillar, with the letters W. H. cut on its north
side, on the east, G., and on the south-west, T. G. It serves as a
guide-post to the Grange, the Heights, and village. The sun shone yellow
on its grey head, reminding me of summer; and I cannot say why, but all
at once a gush of child's sensations flowed into my heart. Hindley and I
held it a favourite spot twenty years before. I gazed long at the
weather-worn block; and, stooping down, perceived a hole near the bottom
still full of snail-shells and pebbles, which we were fond of storing
there with more perishable things; and, as fresh as reality, it appeared
that I beheld my early playmate seated on the withered turf: his dark,
square head bent forward, and his little hand scooping out the earth
with a piece of slate. 'Poor Hindley!' I exclaimed, involuntarily. I
started: my bodily eye was cheated into a momentary belief that the
child lifted its face and stared straight into mine! It vanished in a
twinkling; but immediately I felt an irresistible yearning to be at the
Heights. Superstition urged me to comply with this impulse: supposing he
should be dead! I thought--or should die soon!--supposing it were a sign
of death! The nearer I got to the house the more agitated I grew; and on
catching sight of it I trembled in every limb. The apparition had
outstripped me: it stood looking through the gate. That was my first
idea on observing an elf-locked, brown-eyed boy setting his ruddy
countenance against the bars. Further reflection suggested this must be
Hareton, _my_ Hareton, not altered greatly since I left him, ten months
since.

'God bless thee, darling!' I cried, forgetting instantaneously my
foolish fears. 'Hareton, it's Nelly! Nelly, thy nurse.'

He retreated out of arm's length, and picked up a large flint.

'I am come to see thy father, Hareton,' I added, guessing from the
action that Nelly, if she lived in his memory at all, was not recognised
as one with me.

He raised his missile to hurl it; I commenced a soothing speech, but
could not stay his hand: the stone struck my bonnet; and then ensued,
from the stammering lips of the little fellow, a string of curses, which,
whether he comprehended them or not, were delivered with practised
emphasis, and distorted his baby features into a shocking expression of
malignity.  You may be certain this grieved more than angered me.  Fit to
cry, I took an orange from my pocket, and offered it to propitiate him.
He hesitated, and then snatched it from my hold; as if he fancied I only
intended to tempt and disappoint him.  I showed another, keeping it out
of his reach.

'Who has taught you those fine words, my bairn?' I inquired.  'The
curate?'

'Damn the curate, and thee!  Gie me that,' he replied.

'Tell us where you got your lessons, and you shall have it,' said I.
'Who's your master?'

'Devil daddy,' was his answer.

'And what do you learn from daddy?' I continued.

He jumped at the fruit; I raised it higher.  'What does he teach you?' I
asked.

'Naught,' said he, 'but to keep out of his gait.  Daddy cannot bide me,
because I swear at him.'

'Ah! and the devil teaches you to swear at daddy?' I observed.

'Ay--nay,' he drawled.

'Who, then?'

'Heathcliff.'

'I asked if he liked Mr. Heathcliff.'

'Ay!' he answered again.

Desiring to have his reasons for liking him, I could only gather the
sentences--'I known't: he pays dad back what he gies to me--he curses
daddy for cursing me.  He says I mun do as I will.'

'And the curate does not teach you to read and write, then?' I pursued.

'No, I was told the curate should have his--teeth dashed down his--throat,
if he stepped over the threshold--Heathcliff had promised that!'

I put the orange in his hand, and bade him tell his father that a woman
called Nelly Dean was waiting to speak with him, by the garden gate.  He
went up the walk, and entered the house; but, instead of Hindley,
Heathcliff appeared on the door-stones; and I turned directly and ran
down the road as hard as ever I could race, making no halt till I gained
the guide-post, and feeling as scared as if I had raised a goblin.  This
is not much connected with Miss Isabella's affair: except that it urged
me to resolve further on mounting vigilant guard, and doing my utmost to
check the spread of such bad influence at the Grange: even though I
should wake a domestic storm, by thwarting Mrs. Linton's pleasure.

The next time Heathcliff came my young lady chanced to be feeding some
pigeons in the court.  She had never spoken a word to her sister-in-law
for three days; but she had likewise dropped her fretful complaining, and
we found it a great comfort.  Heathcliff had not the habit of bestowing a
single unnecessary civility on Miss Linton, I knew.  Now, as soon as he
beheld her, his first precaution was to take a sweeping survey of the
house-front.  I was standing by the kitchen-window, but I drew out of
sight.  He then stepped across the pavement to her, and said something:
she seemed embarrassed, and desirous of getting away; to prevent it, he
laid his hand on her arm.  She averted her face: he apparently put some
question which she had no mind to answer.  There was another rapid glance
at the house, and supposing himself unseen, the scoundrel had the
impudence to embrace her.

'Judas!  Traitor!' I ejaculated.  'You are a hypocrite, too, are you?  A
deliberate deceiver.'

'Who is, Nelly?' said Catherine's voice at my elbow: I had been
over-intent on watching the pair outside to mark her entrance.

'Your worthless friend!' I answered, warmly: 'the sneaking rascal yonder.
Ah, he has caught a glimpse of us--he is coming in!  I wonder will he
have the heart to find a plausible excuse for making love to Miss, when
he told you he hated her?'

Mrs. Linton saw Isabella tear herself free, and run into the garden; and
a minute after, Heathcliff opened the door.  I couldn't withhold giving
some loose to my indignation; but Catherine angrily insisted on silence,
and threatened to order me out of the kitchen, if I dared to be so
presumptuous as to put in my insolent tongue.

'To hear you, people might think you were the mistress!' she cried.  'You
want setting down in your right place!  Heathcliff, what are you about,
raising this stir?  I said you must let Isabella alone!--I beg you will,
unless you are tired of being received here, and wish Linton to draw the
bolts against you!'

'God forbid that he should try!' answered the black villain.  I detested
him just then.  'God keep him meek and patient!  Every day I grow madder
after sending him to heaven!'

'Hush!' said Catherine, shutting the inner door!  'Don't vex me.  Why
have you disregarded my request?  Did she come across you on purpose?'

'What is it to you?' he growled.  'I have a right to kiss her, if she
chooses; and you have no right to object.  I am not _your_ husband: _you_
needn't be jealous of me!'

'I'm not jealous of you,' replied the mistress; 'I'm jealous for you.
Clear your face: you sha'n't scowl at me!  If you like Isabella, you
shall marry her.  But do you like her?  Tell the truth, Heathcliff!
There, you won't answer.  I'm certain you don't.'

'And would Mr. Linton approve of his sister marrying that man?' I
inquired.

'Mr. Linton should approve,' returned my lady, decisively.

'He might spare himself the trouble,' said Heathcliff: 'I could do as
well without his approbation. And as to you, Catherine, I have a mind to
speak a few words now, while we are at it. I want you to be aware that I
_know_ you have treated me infernally--infernally! Do you hear? And if
you flatter yourself that I don't perceive it, you are a fool; and if
you think I can be consoled by sweet words, you are an idiot: and if you
fancy I'll suffer unrevenged, I'll convince you of the contrary, in a
very little while! Meantime, thank you for telling me your
sister-in-law's secret: I swear I'll make the most of it. And stand you
aside!'

'What new phase of his character is this?' exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in
amazement.  'I've treated you infernally--and you'll take your revenge!
How will you take it, ungrateful brute?  How have I treated you
infernally?'

'I seek no revenge on you,' replied Heathcliff, less vehemently.  'That's
not the plan.  The tyrant grinds down his slaves and they don't turn
against him; they crush those beneath them.  You are welcome to torture
me to death for your amusement, only allow me to amuse myself a little in
the same style, and refrain from insult as much as you are able.  Having
levelled my palace, don't erect a hovel and complacently admire your own
charity in giving me that for a home.  If I imagined you really wished me
to marry Isabel, I'd cut my throat!'

'Oh, the evil is that I am _not_ jealous, is it?' cried Catherine.  'Well,
I won't repeat my offer of a wife: it is as bad as offering Satan a lost
soul.  Your bliss lies, like his, in inflicting misery.  You prove it.
Edgar is restored from the ill-temper he gave way to at your coming; I
begin to be secure and tranquil; and you, restless to know us at peace,
appear resolved on exciting a quarrel.  Quarrel with Edgar, if you
please, Heathcliff, and deceive his sister: you'll hit on exactly the
most efficient method of revenging yourself on me.'

The conversation ceased.  Mrs. Linton sat down by the fire, flushed and
gloomy.  The spirit which served her was growing intractable: she could
neither lay nor control it.  He stood on the hearth with folded arms,
brooding on his evil thoughts; and in this position I left them to seek
the master, who was wondering what kept Catherine below so long.

'Ellen,' said he, when I entered, 'have you seen your mistress?'

'Yes; she's in the kitchen, sir,' I answered.  'She's sadly put out by
Mr. Heathcliff's behaviour: and, indeed, I do think it's time to arrange
his visits on another footing.  There's harm in being too soft, and now
it's come to this--.'  And I related the scene in the court, and, as near
as I dared, the whole subsequent dispute.  I fancied it could not be very
prejudicial to Mrs. Linton; unless she made it so afterwards, by assuming
the defensive for her guest.  Edgar Linton had difficulty in hearing me
to the close.  His first words revealed that he did not clear his wife of
blame.

'This is insufferable!' he exclaimed.  'It is disgraceful that she should
own him for a friend, and force his company on me!  Call me two men out
of the hall, Ellen.  Catherine shall linger no longer to argue with the
low ruffian--I have humoured her enough.'

He descended, and bidding the servants wait in the passage, went,
followed by me, to the kitchen.  Its occupants had recommenced their
angry discussion: Mrs. Linton, at least, was scolding with renewed
vigour; Heathcliff had moved to the window, and hung his head, somewhat
cowed by her violent rating apparently.  He saw the master first, and
made a hasty motion that she should be silent; which she obeyed,
abruptly, on discovering the reason of his intimation.

'How is this?' said Linton, addressing her; 'what notion of propriety
must you have to remain here, after the language which has been held to
you by that blackguard?  I suppose, because it is his ordinary talk you
think nothing of it: you are habituated to his baseness, and, perhaps,
imagine I can get used to it too!'

'Have you been listening at the door, Edgar?' asked the mistress, in a
tone particularly calculated to provoke her husband, implying both
carelessness and contempt of his irritation.  Heathcliff, who had raised
his eyes at the former speech, gave a sneering laugh at the latter; on
purpose, it seemed, to draw Mr. Linton's attention to him.  He succeeded;
but Edgar did not mean to entertain him with any high flights of passion.

'I've been so far forbearing with you, sir,' he said quietly; 'not that I
was ignorant of your miserable, degraded character, but I felt you were
only partly responsible for that; and Catherine wishing to keep up your
acquaintance, I acquiesced--foolishly.  Your presence is a moral poison
that would contaminate the most virtuous: for that cause, and to prevent
worse consequences, I shall deny you hereafter admission into this house,
and give notice now that I require your instant departure.  Three
minutes' delay will render it involuntary and ignominious.'

Heathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with an eye
full of derision.

'Cathy, this lamb of yours threatens like a bull!' he said.  'It is in
danger of splitting its skull against my knuckles.  By God!  Mr. Linton,
I'm mortally sorry that you are not worth knocking down!'

My master glanced towards the passage, and signed me to fetch the men: he
had no intention of hazarding a personal encounter.  I obeyed the hint;
but Mrs. Linton, suspecting something, followed; and when I attempted to
call them, she pulled me back, slammed the door to, and locked it.

'Fair means!' she said, in answer to her husband's look of angry
surprise.  'If you have not courage to attack him, make an apology, or
allow yourself to be beaten.  It will correct you of feigning more valour
than you possess.  No, I'll swallow the key before you shall get it!  I'm
delightfully rewarded for my kindness to each!  After constant indulgence
of one's weak nature, and the other's bad one, I earn for thanks two
samples of blind ingratitude, stupid to absurdity!  Edgar, I was
defending you and yours; and I wish Heathcliff may flog you sick, for
daring to think an evil thought of me!'

It did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that effect on the
master.  He tried to wrest the key from Catherine's grasp, and for safety
she flung it into the hottest part of the fire; whereupon Mr. Edgar was
taken with a nervous trembling, and his countenance grew deadly pale.  For
his life he could not avert that excess of emotion: mingled anguish and
humiliation overcame him completely.  He leant on the back of a chair,
and covered his face.

'Oh, heavens!  In old days this would win you knighthood!' exclaimed Mrs.
Linton.  'We are vanquished! we are vanquished!  Heathcliff would as soon
lift a finger at you as the king would march his army against a colony of
mice.  Cheer up! you sha'n't be hurt!  Your type is not a lamb, it's a
sucking leveret.'

'I wish you joy of the milk-blooded coward, Cathy!' said her friend.  'I
compliment you on your taste.  And that is the slavering, shivering thing
you preferred to me!  I would not strike him with my fist, but I'd kick
him with my foot, and experience considerable satisfaction.  Is he
weeping, or is he going to faint for fear?'

The fellow approached and gave the chair on which Linton rested a push.
He'd better have kept his distance: my master quickly sprang erect, and
struck him full on the throat a blow that would have levelled a slighter
man.  It took his breath for a minute; and while he choked, Mr. Linton
walked out by the back door into the yard, and from thence to the front
entrance.

'There! you've done with coming here,' cried Catherine.  'Get away, now;
he'll return with a brace of pistols and half-a-dozen assistants.  If he
did overhear us, of course he'd never forgive you.  You've played me an
ill turn, Heathcliff!  But go--make haste!  I'd rather see Edgar at bay
than you.'

'Do you suppose I'm going with that blow burning in my gullet?' he
thundered.  'By hell, no!  I'll crush his ribs in like a rotten hazel-nut
before I cross the threshold!  If I don't floor him now, I shall murder
him some time; so, as you value his existence, let me get at him!'

'He is not coming,' I interposed, framing a bit of a lie.  'There's the
coachman and the two gardeners; you'll surely not wait to be thrust into
the road by them!  Each has a bludgeon; and master will, very likely, be
watching from the parlour-windows to see that they fulfil his orders.'

The gardeners and coachman were there: but Linton was with them.  They
had already entered the court.  Heathcliff, on the second thoughts,
resolved to avoid a struggle against three underlings: he seized the
poker, smashed the lock from the inner door, and made his escape as they
tramped in.

Mrs. Linton, who was very much excited, bade me accompany her up-stairs.
She did not know my share in contributing to the disturbance, and I was
anxious to keep her in ignorance.

'I'm nearly distracted, Nelly!' she exclaimed, throwing herself on the
sofa.  'A thousand smiths' hammers are beating in my head!  Tell Isabella
to shun me; this uproar is owing to her; and should she or any one else
aggravate my anger at present, I shall get wild.  And, Nelly, say to
Edgar, if you see him again to-night, that I'm in danger of being
seriously ill.  I wish it may prove true.  He has startled and distressed
me shockingly!  I want to frighten him.  Besides, he might come and begin
a string of abuse or complainings; I'm certain I should recriminate, and
God knows where we should end!  Will you do so, my good Nelly?  You are
aware that I am no way blamable in this matter.  What possessed him to
turn listener?  Heathcliff's talk was outrageous, after you left us; but
I could soon have diverted him from Isabella, and the rest meant nothing.
Now all is dashed wrong; by the fool's craving to hear evil of self, that
haunts some people like a demon!  Had Edgar never gathered our
conversation, he would never have been the worse for it.  Really, when he
opened on me in that unreasonable tone of displeasure after I had scolded
Heathcliff till I was hoarse for him, I did not care hardly what they did
to each other; especially as I felt that, however the scene closed, we
should all be driven asunder for nobody knows how long!  Well, if I
cannot keep Heathcliff for my friend--if Edgar will be mean and jealous,
I'll try to break their hearts by breaking my own.  That will be a prompt
way of finishing all, when I am pushed to extremity!  But it's a deed to
be reserved for a forlorn hope; I'd not take Linton by surprise with it.
To this point he has been discreet in dreading to provoke me; you must
represent the peril of quitting that policy, and remind him of my
passionate temper, verging, when kindled, on frenzy.  I wish you could
dismiss that apathy out of that countenance, and look rather more anxious
about me.'

The stolidity with which I received these instructions was, no doubt,
rather exasperating: for they were delivered in perfect sincerity; but I
believed a person who could plan the turning of her fits of passion to
account, beforehand, might, by exerting her will, manage to control
herself tolerably, even while under their influence; and I did not wish
to 'frighten' her husband, as she said, and multiply his annoyances for
the purpose of serving her selfishness.  Therefore I said nothing when I
met the master coming towards the parlour; but I took the liberty of
turning back to listen whether they would resume their quarrel together.
He began to speak first.

'Remain where you are, Catherine,' he said; without any anger in his
voice, but with much sorrowful despondency.  'I shall not stay.  I am
neither come to wrangle nor be reconciled; but I wish just to learn
whether, after this evening's events, you intend to continue your
intimacy with--'

'Oh, for mercy's sake,' interrupted the mistress, stamping her foot, 'for
mercy's sake, let us hear no more of it now!  Your cold blood cannot be
worked into a fever: your veins are full of ice-water; but mine are
boiling, and the sight of such chillness makes them dance.'

'To get rid of me, answer my question,' persevered Mr. Linton.  'You must
answer it; and that violence does not alarm me.  I have found that you
can be as stoical as anyone, when you please.  Will you give up
Heathcliff hereafter, or will you give up me?  It is impossible for you
to be _my_ friend and _his_ at the same time; and I absolutely _require_
to know which you choose.'

'I require to be let alone!' exclaimed Catherine, furiously.  'I demand
it!  Don't you see I can scarcely stand?  Edgar, you--you leave me!'

She rang the bell till it broke with a twang; I entered leisurely.  It
was enough to try the temper of a saint, such senseless, wicked rages!
There she lay dashing her head against the arm of the sofa, and grinding
her teeth, so that you might fancy she would crash them to splinters!  Mr.
Linton stood looking at her in sudden compunction and fear.  He told me
to fetch some water.  She had no breath for speaking.  I brought a glass
full; and as she would not drink, I sprinkled it on her face.  In a few
seconds she stretched herself out stiff, and turned up her eyes, while
her cheeks, at once blanched and livid, assumed the aspect of death.
Linton looked terrified.

'There is nothing in the world the matter,' I whispered.  I did not want
him to yield, though I could not help being afraid in my heart.

'She has blood on her lips!' he said, shuddering.

'Never mind!' I answered, tartly. And I told him how she had resolved,
previous to his coming, on exhibiting a fit of frenzy. I incautiously
gave the account aloud, and she heard me; for she started up--her hair
flying over her shoulders, her eyes flashing, the muscles of her neck
and arms standing out preternaturally. I made up my mind for broken
bones, at least; but she only glared about her for an instant, and then
rushed from the room. The master directed me to follow; I did, to her
chamber-door: she hindered me from going further by securing it against
me.

As she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning, I went to ask
whether she would have some carried up.  'No!' she replied, peremptorily.
The same question was repeated at dinner and tea; and again on the morrow
after, and received the same answer.  Mr. Linton, on his part, spent his
time in the library, and did not inquire concerning his wife's
occupations.  Isabella and he had had an hour's interview, during which
he tried to elicit from her some sentiment of proper horror for
Heathcliff's advances: but he could make nothing of her evasive replies,
and was obliged to close the examination unsatisfactorily; adding,
however, a solemn warning, that if she were so insane as to encourage
that worthless suitor, it would dissolve all bonds of relationship
between herself and him.




CHAPTER XII


While Miss Linton moped about the park and garden, always silent, and
almost always in tears; and her brother shut himself up among books that
he never opened--wearying, I guessed, with a continual vague expectation
that Catherine, repenting her conduct, would come of her own accord to
ask pardon, and seek a reconciliation--and _she_ fasted pertinaciously,
under the idea, probably, that at every meal Edgar was ready to choke for
her absence, and pride alone held him from running to cast himself at her
feet; I went about my household duties, convinced that the Grange had but
one sensible soul in its walls, and that lodged in my body.  I wasted no
condolences on Miss, nor any expostulations on my mistress; nor did I pay
much attention to the sighs of my master, who yearned to hear his lady's
name, since he might not hear her voice.  I determined they should come
about as they pleased for me; and though it was a tiresomely slow
process, I began to rejoice at length in a faint dawn of its progress: as
I thought at first.

Mrs. Linton, on the third day, unbarred her door, and having finished the
water in her pitcher and decanter, desired a renewed supply, and a basin
of gruel, for she believed she was dying.  That I set down as a speech
meant for Edgar's ears; I believed no such thing, so I kept it to myself
and brought her some tea and dry toast.  She ate and drank eagerly, and
sank back on her pillow again, clenching her hands and groaning.  'Oh, I
will die,' she exclaimed, 'since no one cares anything about me.  I wish
I had not taken that.'  Then a good while after I heard her murmur, 'No,
I'll not die--he'd be glad--he does not love me at all--he would never
miss me!'

'Did you want anything, ma'am?' I inquired, still preserving my external
composure, in spite of her ghastly countenance and strange, exaggerated
manner.

'What is that apathetic being doing?' she demanded, pushing the thick
entangled locks from her wasted face.  'Has he fallen into a lethargy, or
is he dead?'

'Neither,' replied I; 'if you mean Mr. Linton.  He's tolerably well, I
think, though his studies occupy him rather more than they ought: he is
continually among his books, since he has no other society.'

I should not have spoken so if I had known her true condition, but I
could not get rid of the notion that she acted a part of her disorder.

'Among his books!' she cried, confounded.  'And I dying!  I on the brink
of the grave!  My God! does he know how I'm altered?' continued she,
staring at her reflection in a mirror hanging against the opposite wall.
'Is that Catherine Linton?  He imagines me in a pet--in play, perhaps.
Cannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest?  Nelly, if it be not
too late, as soon as I learn how he feels, I'll choose between these two:
either to starve at once--that would be no punishment unless he had a
heart--or to recover, and leave the country.  Are you speaking the truth
about him now?  Take care.  Is he actually so utterly indifferent for my
life?'

'Why, ma'am,' I answered, 'the master has no idea of your being deranged;
and of course he does not fear that you will let yourself die of hunger.'

'You think not?  Cannot you tell him I will?' she returned.  'Persuade
him! speak of your own mind: say you are certain I will!'

'No, you forget, Mrs. Linton,' I suggested, 'that you have eaten some
food with a relish this evening, and to-morrow you will perceive its good
effects.'

'If I were only sure it would kill him,' she interrupted, 'I'd kill
myself directly!  These three awful nights I've never closed my lids--and
oh, I've been tormented!  I've been haunted, Nelly!  But I begin to fancy
you don't like me.  How strange!  I thought, though everybody hated and
despised each other, they could not avoid loving me.  And they have all
turned to enemies in a few hours: they have, I'm positive; the people
here.  How dreary to meet death, surrounded by their cold faces!
Isabella, terrified and repelled, afraid to enter the room, it would be
so dreadful to watch Catherine go.  And Edgar standing solemnly by to see
it over; then offering prayers of thanks to God for restoring peace to
his house, and going back to his _books_!  What in the name of all that
feels has he to do with _books_, when I am dying?'

She could not bear the notion which I had put into her head of Mr.
Linton's philosophical resignation.  Tossing about, she increased her
feverish bewilderment to madness, and tore the pillow with her teeth;
then raising herself up all burning, desired that I would open the
window.  We were in the middle of winter, the wind blew strong from the
north-east, and I objected.  Both the expressions flitting over her face,
and the changes of her moods, began to alarm me terribly; and brought to
my recollection her former illness, and the doctor's injunction that she
should not be crossed.  A minute previously she was violent; now,
supported on one arm, and not noticing my refusal to obey her, she seemed
to find childish diversion in pulling the feathers from the rents she had
just made, and ranging them on the sheet according to their different
species: her mind had strayed to other associations.

'That's a turkey's,' she murmured to herself; 'and this is a wild duck's;
and this is a pigeon's.  Ah, they put pigeons' feathers in the pillows--no
wonder I couldn't die!  Let me take care to throw it on the floor when I
lie down.  And here is a moor-cock's; and this--I should know it among a
thousand--it's a lapwing's.  Bonny bird; wheeling over our heads in the
middle of the moor.  It wanted to get to its nest, for the clouds had
touched the swells, and it felt rain coming.  This feather was picked up
from the heath, the bird was not shot: we saw its nest in the winter,
full of little skeletons.  Heathcliff set a trap over it, and the old
ones dared not come.  I made him promise he'd never shoot a lapwing after
that, and he didn't.  Yes, here are more!  Did he shoot my lapwings,
Nelly?  Are they red, any of them?  Let me look.'

'Give over with that baby-work!' I interrupted, dragging the pillow away,
and turning the holes towards the mattress, for she was removing its
contents by handfuls.  'Lie down and shut your eyes: you're wandering.
There's a mess!  The down is flying about like snow.'

I went here and there collecting it.

'I see in you, Nelly,' she continued dreamily, 'an aged woman: you have
grey hair and bent shoulders.  This bed is the fairy cave under Penistone
crags, and you are gathering elf-bolts to hurt our heifers; pretending,
while I am near, that they are only locks of wool.  That's what you'll
come to fifty years hence: I know you are not so now.  I'm not wandering:
you're mistaken, or else I should believe you really _were_ that withered
hag, and I should think I _was_ under Penistone Crags; and I'm conscious
it's night, and there are two candles on the table making the black press
shine like jet.'

'The black press? where is that?' I asked.  'You are talking in your
sleep!'

'It's against the wall, as it always is,' she replied.  'It _does_ appear
odd--I see a face in it!'

'There's no press in the room, and never was,' said I, resuming my seat,
and looping up the curtain that I might watch her.

'Don't _you_ see that face?' she inquired, gazing earnestly at the
mirror.

And say what I could, I was incapable of making her comprehend it to be
her own; so I rose and covered it with a shawl.

'It's behind there still!' she pursued, anxiously.  'And it stirred.  Who
is it?  I hope it will not come out when you are gone!  Oh!  Nelly, the
room is haunted!  I'm afraid of being alone!'

I took her hand in mine, and bid her be composed; for a succession of
shudders convulsed her frame, and she would keep straining her gaze
towards the glass.

'There's nobody here!' I insisted.  'It was _yourself_, Mrs. Linton: you
knew it a while since.'

'Myself!' she gasped, 'and the clock is striking twelve!  It's true,
then! that's dreadful!'

Her fingers clutched the clothes, and gathered them over her eyes.  I
attempted to steal to the door with an intention of calling her husband;
but I was summoned back by a piercing shriek--the shawl had dropped from
the frame.

'Why, what is the matter?' cried I.  'Who is coward now?  Wake up!  That
is the glass--the mirror, Mrs. Linton; and you see yourself in it, and
there am I too by your side.'

Trembling and bewildered, she held me fast, but the horror gradually
passed from her countenance; its paleness gave place to a glow of shame.

'Oh, dear!  I thought I was at home,' she sighed.  'I thought I was lying
in my chamber at Wuthering Heights.  Because I'm weak, my brain got
confused, and I screamed unconsciously.  Don't say anything; but stay
with me.  I dread sleeping: my dreams appal me.'

'A sound sleep would do you good, ma'am,' I answered: 'and I hope this
suffering will prevent your trying starving again.'

'Oh, if I were but in my own bed in the old house!' she went on bitterly,
wringing her hands.  'And that wind sounding in the firs by the lattice.
Do let me feel it--it comes straight down the moor--do let me have one
breath!'  To pacify her I held the casement ajar a few seconds.  A cold
blast rushed through; I closed it, and returned to my post.  She lay
still now, her face bathed in tears.  Exhaustion of body had entirely
subdued her spirit: our fiery Catherine was no better than a wailing
child.

'How long is it since I shut myself in here?' she asked, suddenly
reviving.

'It was Monday evening,' I replied, 'and this is Thursday night, or
rather Friday morning, at present.'

'What! of the same week?' she exclaimed.  'Only that brief time?'

'Long enough to live on nothing but cold water and ill-temper,' observed
I.

'Well, it seems a weary number of hours,' she muttered doubtfully: 'it
must be more. I remember being in the parlour after they had quarrelled,
and Edgar being cruelly provoking, and me running into this room
desperate. As soon as ever I had barred the door, utter blackness
overwhelmed me, and I fell on the floor. I couldn't explain to Edgar how
certain I felt of having a fit, or going raging mad, if he persisted in
teasing me! I had no command of tongue, or brain, and he did not guess
my agony, perhaps: it barely left me sense to try to escape from him and
his voice. Before I recovered sufficiently to see and hear, it began to
be dawn, and, Nelly, I'll tell you what I thought, and what has kept
recurring and recurring till I feared for my reason. I thought as I lay
there, with my head against that table leg, and my eyes dimly discerning
the grey square of the window, that I was enclosed in the oak-panelled
bed at home; and my heart ached with some great grief which, just
waking, I could not recollect. I pondered, and worried myself to
discover what it could be, and, most strangely, the whole last seven
years of my life grew a blank! I did not recall that they had been at
all. I was a child; my father was just buried, and my misery arose from
the separation that Hindley had ordered between me and Heathcliff. I was
laid alone, for the first time; and, rousing from a dismal doze after a
night of weeping, I lifted my hand to push the panels aside: it struck
the table-top! I swept it along the carpet, and then memory burst in: my
late anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of despair. I cannot say why I
felt so wildly wretched: it must have been temporary derangement; for
there is scarcely cause. But, supposing at twelve years old I had been
wrenched from the Heights, and every early association, and my all in
all, as Heathcliff was at that time, and been converted at a stroke into
Mrs. Linton, the lady of Thrushcross Grange, and the wife of a stranger:
an exile, and outcast, thenceforth, from what had been my world. You may
fancy a glimpse of the abyss where I grovelled! Shake your head as you
will, Nelly, you have helped to unsettle me! You should have spoken to
Edgar, indeed you should, and compelled him to leave me quiet! Oh, I'm
burning! I wish I were out of doors! I wish I were a girl again, half
savage and hardy, and free; and laughing at injuries, not maddening
under them! Why am I so changed? why does my blood rush into a hell of
tumult at a few words? I'm sure I should be myself were I once among the
heather on those hills. Open the window again wide: fasten it open!
Quick, why don't you move?'

'Because I won't give you your death of cold,' I answered.

'You won't give me a chance of life, you mean,' she said, sullenly.
'However, I'm not helpless yet; I'll open it myself.'

And sliding from the bed before I could hinder her, she crossed the room,
walking very uncertainly, threw it back, and bent out, careless of the
frosty air that cut about her shoulders as keen as a knife.  I entreated,
and finally attempted to force her to retire.  But I soon found her
delirious strength much surpassed mine (she was delirious, I became
convinced by her subsequent actions and ravings).  There was no moon, and
everything beneath lay in misty darkness: not a light gleamed from any
house, far or near all had been extinguished long ago: and those at
Wuthering Heights were never visible--still she asserted she caught their
shining.

'Look!' she cried eagerly, 'that's my room with the candle in it, and the
trees swaying before it; and the other candle is in Joseph's garret.
Joseph sits up late, doesn't he?  He's waiting till I come home that he
may lock the gate.  Well, he'll wait a while yet.  It's a rough journey,
and a sad heart to travel it; and we must pass by Gimmerton Kirk to go
that journey!  We've braved its ghosts often together, and dared each
other to stand among the graves and ask them to come.  But, Heathcliff,
if I dare you now, will you venture?  If you do, I'll keep you.  I'll not
lie there by myself: they may bury me twelve feet deep, and throw the
church down over me, but I won't rest till you are with me.  I never
will!'

She paused, and resumed with a strange smile.  'He's considering--he'd
rather I'd come to him!  Find a way, then! not through that kirkyard.  You
are slow!  Be content, you always followed me!'

Perceiving it vain to argue against her insanity, I was planning how I
could reach something to wrap about her, without quitting my hold of
herself (for I could not trust her alone by the gaping lattice), when, to
my consternation, I heard the rattle of the door-handle, and Mr. Linton
entered.  He had only then come from the library; and, in passing through
the lobby, had noticed our talking and been attracted by curiosity, or
fear, to examine what it signified, at that late hour.

'Oh, sir!' I cried, checking the exclamation risen to his lips at the
sight which met him, and the bleak atmosphere of the chamber.  'My poor
mistress is ill, and she quite masters me: I cannot manage her at all;
pray, come and persuade her to go to bed.  Forget your anger, for she's
hard to guide any way but her own.'

'Catherine ill?' he said, hastening to us.  'Shut the window, Ellen!
Catherine! why--'

He was silent.  The haggardness of Mrs. Linton's appearance smote him
speechless, and he could only glance from her to me in horrified
astonishment.

'She's been fretting here,' I continued, 'and eating scarcely anything,
and never complaining: she would admit none of us till this evening, and
so we couldn't inform you of her state, as we were not aware of it
ourselves; but it is nothing.'

I felt I uttered my explanations awkwardly; the master frowned.  'It is
nothing, is it, Ellen Dean?' he said sternly.  'You shall account more
clearly for keeping me ignorant of this!'  And he took his wife in his
arms, and looked at her with anguish.

At first she gave him no glance of recognition: he was invisible to her
abstracted gaze.  The delirium was not fixed, however; having weaned her
eyes from contemplating the outer darkness, by degrees she centred her
attention on him, and discovered who it was that held her.

'Ah! you are come, are you, Edgar Linton?' she said, with angry
animation.  'You are one of those things that are ever found when least
wanted, and when you are wanted, never!  I suppose we shall have plenty
of lamentations now--I see we shall--but they can't keep me from my
narrow home out yonder: my resting-place, where I'm bound before spring
is over!  There it is: not among the Lintons, mind, under the
chapel-roof, but in the open air, with a head-stone; and you may please
yourself whether you go to them or come to me!'

'Catherine, what have you done?' commenced the master.  'Am I nothing to
you any more?  Do you love that wretch Heath--'

'Hush!' cried Mrs. Linton.  'Hush, this moment!  You mention that name
and I end the matter instantly by a spring from the window!  What you
touch at present you may have; but my soul will be on that hill-top
before you lay hands on me again.  I don't want you, Edgar: I'm past
wanting you.  Return to your books.  I'm glad you possess a consolation,
for all you had in me is gone.'

'Her mind wanders, sir,' I interposed.  'She has been talking nonsense
the whole evening; but let her have quiet, and proper attendance, and
she'll rally.  Hereafter, we must be cautious how we vex her.'

'I desire no further advice from you,' answered Mr. Linton.  'You knew
your mistress's nature, and you encouraged me to harass her.  And not to
give me one hint of how she has been these three days!  It was heartless!
Months of sickness could not cause such a change!'

I began to defend myself, thinking it too bad to be blamed for another's
wicked waywardness.  'I knew Mrs. Linton's nature to be headstrong and
domineering,' cried I: 'but I didn't know that you wished to foster her
fierce temper!  I didn't know that, to humour her, I should wink at Mr.
Heathcliff.  I performed the duty of a faithful servant in telling you,
and I have got a faithful servant's wages!  Well, it will teach me to be
careful next time.  Next time you may gather intelligence for yourself!'

'The next time you bring a tale to me you shall quit my service, Ellen
Dean,' he replied.

'You'd rather hear nothing about it, I suppose, then, Mr. Linton?' said
I.  'Heathcliff has your permission to come a-courting to Miss, and to
drop in at every opportunity your absence offers, on purpose to poison
the mistress against you?'

Confused as Catherine was, her wits were alert at applying our
conversation.

'Ah!  Nelly has played traitor,' she exclaimed, passionately.  'Nelly is
my hidden enemy.  You witch!  So you do seek elf-bolts to hurt us!  Let
me go, and I'll make her rue!  I'll make her howl a recantation!'

A maniac's fury kindled under her brows; she struggled desperately to
disengage herself from Linton's arms.  I felt no inclination to tarry the
event; and, resolving to seek medical aid on my own responsibility, I
quitted the chamber.

In passing the garden to reach the road, at a place where a bridle hook
is driven into the wall, I saw something white moved irregularly,
evidently by another agent than the wind.  Notwithstanding my hurry, I
stayed to examine it, lest ever after I should have the conviction
impressed on my imagination that it was a creature of the other world.  My
surprise and perplexity were great on discovering, by touch more than
vision, Miss Isabella's springer, Fanny, suspended by a handkerchief, and
nearly at its last gasp.  I quickly released the animal, and lifted it
into the garden.  I had seen it follow its mistress up-stairs when she
went to bed; and wondered much how it could have got out there, and what
mischievous person had treated it so.  While untying the knot round the
hook, it seemed to me that I repeatedly caught the beat of horses' feet
galloping at some distance; but there were such a number of things to
occupy my reflections that I hardly gave the circumstance a thought:
though it was a strange sound, in that place, at two o'clock in the
morning.

Mr. Kenneth was fortunately just issuing from his house to see a patient
in the village as I came up the street; and my account of Catherine
Linton's malady induced him to accompany me back immediately.  He was a
plain rough man; and he made no scruple to speak his doubts of her
surviving this second attack; unless she were more submissive to his
directions than she had shown herself before.

'Nelly Dean,' said he, 'I can't help fancying there's an extra cause for
this.  What has there been to do at the Grange?  We've odd reports up
here.  A stout, hearty lass like Catherine does not fall ill for a
trifle; and that sort of people should not either.  It's hard work
bringing them through fevers, and such things.  How did it begin?'

'The master will inform you,' I answered; 'but you are acquainted with
the Earnshaws' violent dispositions, and Mrs. Linton caps them all.  I
may say this; it commenced in a quarrel.  She was struck during a tempest
of passion with a kind of fit.  That's her account, at least: for she
flew off in the height of it, and locked herself up.  Afterwards, she
refused to eat, and now she alternately raves and remains in a half
dream; knowing those about her, but having her mind filled with all sorts
of strange ideas and illusions.'

'Mr. Linton will be sorry?' observed Kenneth, interrogatively.

'Sorry? he'll break his heart should anything happen!' I replied.  'Don't
alarm him more than necessary.'

'Well, I told him to beware,' said my companion; 'and he must bide the
consequences of neglecting my warning!  Hasn't he been intimate with Mr.
Heathcliff lately?'

'Heathcliff frequently visits at the Grange,' answered I, 'though more on
the strength of the mistress having known him when a boy, than because
the master likes his company.  At present he's discharged from the
trouble of calling; owing to some presumptuous aspirations after Miss
Linton which he manifested.  I hardly think he'll be taken in again.'

'And does Miss Linton turn a cold shoulder on him?' was the doctor's next
question.

'I'm not in her confidence,' returned I, reluctant to continue the
subject.

'No, she's a sly one,' he remarked, shaking his head.  'She keeps her own
counsel!  But she's a real little fool.  I have it from good authority
that last night (and a pretty night it was!) she and Heathcliff were
walking in the plantation at the back of your house above two hours; and
he pressed her not to go in again, but just mount his horse and away with
him!  My informant said she could only put him off by pledging her word
of honour to be prepared on their first meeting after that: when it was
to be he didn't hear; but you urge Mr. Linton to look sharp!'

This news filled me with fresh fears; I outstripped Kenneth, and ran most
of the way back.  The little dog was yelping in the garden yet.  I spared
a minute to open the gate for it, but instead of going to the house door,
it coursed up and down snuffing the grass, and would have escaped to the
road, had I not seized it and conveyed it in with me.  On ascending to
Isabella's room, my suspicions were confirmed: it was empty.  Had I been
a few hours sooner Mrs. Linton's illness might have arrested her rash
step.  But what could be done now?  There was a bare possibility of
overtaking them if pursued instantly.  _I_ could not pursue them,
however; and I dared not rouse the family, and fill the place with
confusion; still less unfold the business to my master, absorbed as he
was in his present calamity, and having no heart to spare for a second
grief!  I saw nothing for it but to hold my tongue, and suffer matters to
take their course; and Kenneth being arrived, I went with a badly
composed countenance to announce him.  Catherine lay in a troubled sleep:
her husband had succeeded in soothing the excess of frenzy; he now hung
over her pillow, watching every shade and every change of her painfully
expressive features.

The doctor, on examining the case for himself, spoke hopefully to him of
its having a favourable termination, if we could only preserve around her
perfect and constant tranquillity.  To me, he signified the threatening
danger was not so much death, as permanent alienation of intellect.

I did not close my eyes that night, nor did Mr. Linton: indeed, we never
went to bed; and the servants were all up long before the usual hour,
moving through the house with stealthy tread, and exchanging whispers as
they encountered each other in their vocations.  Every one was active but
Miss Isabella; and they began to remark how sound she slept: her brother,
too, asked if she had risen, and seemed impatient for her presence, and
hurt that she showed so little anxiety for her sister-in-law.  I trembled
lest he should send me to call her; but I was spared the pain of being
the first proclaimant of her flight.  One of the maids, a thoughtless
girl, who had been on an early errand to Gimmerton, came panting
up-stairs, open-mouthed, and dashed into the chamber, crying: 'Oh, dear,
dear!  What mun we have next?  Master, master, our young lady--'

'Hold your noise!' cried, I hastily, enraged at her clamorous manner.

'Speak lower, Mary--What is the matter?' said Mr. Linton.  'What ails
your young lady?'

'She's gone, she's gone!  Yon' Heathcliff's run off wi' her!' gasped the
girl.

'That is not true!' exclaimed Linton, rising in agitation.  'It cannot
be: how has the idea entered your head?  Ellen Dean, go and seek her.  It
is incredible: it cannot be.'

As he spoke he took the servant to the door, and then repeated his demand
to know her reasons for such an assertion.

'Why, I met on the road a lad that fetches milk here,' she stammered,
'and he asked whether we weren't in trouble at the Grange.  I thought he
meant for missis's sickness, so I answered, yes.  Then says he, "There's
somebody gone after 'em, I guess?"  I stared.  He saw I knew nought about
it, and he told how a gentleman and lady had stopped to have a horse's
shoe fastened at a blacksmith's shop, two miles out of Gimmerton, not
very long after midnight! and how the blacksmith's lass had got up to spy
who they were: she knew them both directly.  And she noticed the
man--Heathcliff it was, she felt certain: nob'dy could mistake him,
besides--put a sovereign in her father's hand for payment.  The lady had
a cloak about her face; but having desired a sup of water, while she
drank it fell back, and she saw her very plain.  Heathcliff held both
bridles as they rode on, and they set their faces from the village, and
went as fast as the rough roads would let them.  The lass said nothing to
her father, but she told it all over Gimmerton this morning.'

I ran and peeped, for form's sake, into Isabella's room; confirming, when
I returned, the servant's statement.  Mr. Linton had resumed his seat by
the bed; on my re-entrance, he raised his eyes, read the meaning of my
blank aspect, and dropped them without giving an order, or uttering a
word.

'Are we to try any measures for overtaking and bringing her back,' I
inquired.  'How should we do?'

'She went of her own accord,' answered the master; 'she had a right to go
if she pleased.  Trouble me no more about her.  Hereafter she is only my
sister in name: not because I disown her, but because she has disowned
me.'

And that was all he said on the subject: he did not make single inquiry
further, or mention her in any way, except directing me to send what
property she had in the house to her fresh home, wherever it was, when I
knew it.




CHAPTER XIII


For two months the fugitives remained absent; in those two months, Mrs.
Linton encountered and conquered the worst shock of what was denominated
a brain fever.  No mother could have nursed an only child more devotedly
than Edgar tended her.  Day and night he was watching, and patiently
enduring all the annoyances that irritable nerves and a shaken reason
could inflict; and, though Kenneth remarked that what he saved from the
grave would only recompense his care by forming the source of constant
future anxiety--in fact, that his health and strength were being
sacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of humanity--he knew no limits in
gratitude and joy when Catherine's life was declared out of danger; and
hour after hour he would sit beside her, tracing the gradual return to
bodily health, and flattering his too sanguine hopes with the illusion
that her mind would settle back to its right balance also, and she would
soon be entirely her former self.

The first time she left her chamber was at the commencement of the
following March.  Mr. Linton had put on her pillow, in the morning, a
handful of golden crocuses; her eye, long stranger to any gleam of
pleasure, caught them in waking, and shone delighted as she gathered them
eagerly together.

'These are the earliest flowers at the Heights,' she exclaimed.  'They
remind me of soft thaw winds, and warm sunshine, and nearly melted snow.
Edgar, is there not a south wind, and is not the snow almost gone?'

'The snow is quite gone down here, darling,' replied her husband; 'and I
only see two white spots on the whole range of moors: the sky is blue,
and the larks are singing, and the becks and brooks are all brim full.
Catherine, last spring at this time, I was longing to have you under this
roof; now, I wish you were a mile or two up those hills: the air blows so
sweetly, I feel that it would cure you.'

'I shall never be there but once more,' said the invalid; 'and then
you'll leave me, and I shall remain for ever.  Next spring you'll long
again to have me under this roof, and you'll look back and think you were
happy to-day.'

Linton lavished on her the kindest caresses, and tried to cheer her by
the fondest words; but, vaguely regarding the flowers, she let the tears
collect on her lashes and stream down her cheeks unheeding.  We knew she
was really better, and, therefore, decided that long confinement to a
single place produced much of this despondency, and it might be partially
removed by a change of scene.  The master told me to light a fire in the
many-weeks' deserted parlour, and to set an easy-chair in the sunshine by
the window; and then he brought her down, and she sat a long while
enjoying the genial heat, and, as we expected, revived by the objects
round her: which, though familiar, were free from the dreary associations
investing her hated sick chamber.  By evening she seemed greatly
exhausted; yet no arguments could persuade her to return to that
apartment, and I had to arrange the parlour sofa for her bed, till
another room could be prepared.  To obviate the fatigue of mounting and
descending the stairs, we fitted up this, where you lie at present--on
the same floor with the parlour; and she was soon strong enough to move
from one to the other, leaning on Edgar's arm.  Ah, I thought myself, she
might recover, so waited on as she was.  And there was double cause to
desire it, for on her existence depended that of another: we cherished
the hope that in a little while Mr. Linton's heart would be gladdened,
and his lands secured from a stranger's grip, by the birth of an heir.

I should mention that Isabella sent to her brother, some six weeks from
her departure, a short note, announcing her marriage with Heathcliff.  It
appeared dry and cold; but at the bottom was dotted in with pencil an
obscure apology, and an entreaty for kind remembrance and reconciliation,
if her proceeding had offended him: asserting that she could not help it
then, and being done, she had now no power to repeal it.  Linton did not
reply to this, I believe; and, in a fortnight more, I got a long letter,
which I considered odd, coming from the pen of a bride just out of the
honeymoon.  I'll read it: for I keep it yet.  Any relic of the dead is
precious, if they were valued living.

* * * * *

DEAR ELLEN, it begins,--I came last night to Wuthering Heights, and
heard, for the first time, that Catherine has been, and is yet, very ill.
I must not write to her, I suppose, and my brother is either too angry or
too distressed to answer what I sent him.  Still, I must write to
somebody, and the only choice left me is you.

Inform Edgar that I'd give the world to see his face again--that my heart
returned to Thrushcross Grange in twenty-four hours after I left it, and
is there at this moment, full of warm feelings for him, and Catherine!  _I
can't follow it though_--(these words are underlined)--they need not
expect me, and they may draw what conclusions they please; taking care,
however, to lay nothing at the door of my weak will or deficient
affection.

The remainder of the letter is for yourself alone.  I want to ask you two
questions: the first is,--How did you contrive to preserve the common
sympathies of human nature when you resided here?  I cannot recognise any
sentiment which those around share with me.

The second question I have great interest in; it is this--Is Mr.
Heathcliff a man?  If so, is he mad?  And if not, is he a devil?  I
sha'n't tell my reasons for making this inquiry; but I beseech you to
explain, if you can, what I have married: that is, when you call to see
me; and you must call, Ellen, very soon.  Don't write, but come, and
bring me something from Edgar.

Now, you shall hear how I have been received in my new home, as I am led
to imagine the Heights will be.  It is to amuse myself that I dwell on
such subjects as the lack of external comforts: they never occupy my
thoughts, except at the moment when I miss them.  I should laugh and
dance for joy, if I found their absence was the total of my miseries, and
the rest was an unnatural dream!

The sun set behind the Grange as we turned on to the moors; by that, I
judged it to be six o'clock; and my companion halted half an hour, to
inspect the park, and the gardens, and, probably, the place itself, as
well as he could; so it was dark when we dismounted in the paved yard of
the farm-house, and your old fellow-servant, Joseph, issued out to
receive us by the light of a dip candle.  He did it with a courtesy that
redounded to his credit.  His first act was to elevate his torch to a
level with my face, squint malignantly, project his under-lip, and turn
away.  Then he took the two horses, and led them into the stables;
reappearing for the purpose of locking the outer gate, as if we lived in
an ancient castle.

Heathcliff stayed to speak to him, and I entered the kitchen--a dingy,
untidy hole; I daresay you would not know it, it is so changed since it
was in your charge.  By the fire stood a ruffianly child, strong in limb
and dirty in garb, with a look of Catherine in his eyes and about his
mouth.

'This is Edgar's legal nephew,' I reflected--'mine in a manner; I must
shake hands, and--yes--I must kiss him.  It is right to establish a good
understanding at the beginning.'

I approached, and, attempting to take his chubby fist, said--'How do you
do, my dear?'

He replied in a jargon I did not comprehend.

'Shall you and I be friends, Hareton?' was my next essay at conversation.

An oath, and a threat to set Throttler on me if I did not 'frame off'
rewarded my perseverance.

'Hey, Throttler, lad!' whispered the little wretch, rousing a half-bred
bull-dog from its lair in a corner.  'Now, wilt thou be ganging?' he
asked authoritatively.

Love for my life urged a compliance; I stepped over the threshold to wait
till the others should enter.  Mr. Heathcliff was nowhere visible; and
Joseph, whom I followed to the stables, and requested to accompany me in,
after staring and muttering to himself, screwed up his nose and
replied--'Mim! mim! mim!  Did iver Christian body hear aught like it?
Mincing un' munching!  How can I tell whet ye say?'

'I say, I wish you to come with me into the house!' I cried, thinking him
deaf, yet highly disgusted at his rudeness.

'None o' me!  I getten summut else to do,' he answered, and continued his
work; moving his lantern jaws meanwhile, and surveying my dress and
countenance (the former a great deal too fine, but the latter, I'm sure,
as sad as he could desire) with sovereign contempt.

I walked round the yard, and through a wicket, to another door, at which
I took the liberty of knocking, in hopes some more civil servant might
show himself.  After a short suspense, it was opened by a tall, gaunt
man, without neckerchief, and otherwise extremely slovenly; his features
were lost in masses of shaggy hair that hung on his shoulders; and _his_
eyes, too, were like a ghostly Catherine's with all their beauty
annihilated.

'What's your business here?' he demanded, grimly.  'Who are you?'

'My name was Isabella Linton,' I replied.  'You've seen me before, sir.
I'm lately married to Mr. Heathcliff, and he has brought me here--I
suppose, by your permission.'

'Is he come back, then?' asked the hermit, glaring like a hungry wolf.

'Yes--we came just now,' I said; 'but he left me by the kitchen door; and
when I would have gone in, your little boy played sentinel over the
place, and frightened me off by the help of a bull-dog.'

'It's well the hellish villain has kept his word!' growled my future
host, searching the darkness beyond me in expectation of discovering
Heathcliff; and then he indulged in a soliloquy of execrations, and
threats of what he would have done had the 'fiend' deceived him.

I repented having tried this second entrance, and was almost inclined to
slip away before he finished cursing, but ere I could execute that
intention, he ordered me in, and shut and re-fastened the door.  There
was a great fire, and that was all the light in the huge apartment, whose
floor had grown a uniform grey; and the once brilliant pewter-dishes,
which used to attract my gaze when I was a girl, partook of a similar
obscurity, created by tarnish and dust.  I inquired whether I might call
the maid, and be conducted to a bedroom!  Mr. Earnshaw vouchsafed no
answer.  He walked up and down, with his hands in his pockets, apparently
quite forgetting my presence; and his abstraction was evidently so deep,
and his whole aspect so misanthropical, that I shrank from disturbing him
again.

You'll not be surprised, Ellen, at my feeling particularly cheerless,
seated in worse than solitude on that inhospitable hearth, and
remembering that four miles distant lay my delightful home, containing
the only people I loved on earth; and there might as well be the
Atlantic to part us, instead of those four miles: I could not overpass
them! I questioned with myself--where must I turn for comfort? and--mind
you don't tell Edgar, or Catherine--above every sorrow beside, this rose
pre-eminent: despair at finding nobody who could or would be my ally
against Heathcliff! I had sought shelter at Wuthering Heights, almost
gladly, because I was secured by that arrangement from living alone with
him; but he knew the people we were coming amongst, and he did not fear
their intermeddling.

I sat and thought a doleful time: the clock struck eight, and nine, and
still my companion paced to and fro, his head bent on his breast, and
perfectly silent, unless a groan or a bitter ejaculation forced itself
out at intervals.  I listened to detect a woman's voice in the house, and
filled the interim with wild regrets and dismal anticipations, which, at
last, spoke audibly in irrepressible sighing and weeping.  I was not
aware how openly I grieved, till Earnshaw halted opposite, in his
measured walk, and gave me a stare of newly-awakened surprise.  Taking
advantage of his recovered attention, I exclaimed--'I'm tired with my
journey, and I want to go to bed!  Where is the maid-servant?  Direct me
to her, as she won't come to me!'

'We have none,' he answered; 'you must wait on yourself!'

'Where must I sleep, then?' I sobbed; I was beyond regarding
self-respect, weighed down by fatigue and wretchedness.

'Joseph will show you Heathcliff's chamber,' said he; 'open that
door--he's in there.'

I was going to obey, but he suddenly arrested me, and added in the
strangest tone--'Be so good as to turn your lock, and draw your
bolt--don't omit it!'

'Well!' I said.  'But why, Mr. Earnshaw?'  I did not relish the notion of
deliberately fastening myself in with Heathcliff.

'Look here!' he replied, pulling from his waistcoat a
curiously-constructed pistol, having a double-edged spring knife attached
to the barrel.  'That's a great tempter to a desperate man, is it not?  I
cannot resist going up with this every night, and trying his door.  If
once I find it open he's done for; I do it invariably, even though the
minute before I have been recalling a hundred reasons that should make me
refrain: it is some devil that urges me to thwart my own schemes by
killing him.  You fight against that devil for love as long as you may;
when the time comes, not all the angels in heaven shall save him!'

I surveyed the weapon inquisitively.  A hideous notion struck me: how
powerful I should be possessing such an instrument!  I took it from his
hand, and touched the blade.  He looked astonished at the expression my
face assumed during a brief second: it was not horror, it was
covetousness.  He snatched the pistol back, jealously; shut the knife,
and returned it to its concealment.

'I don't care if you tell him,' said he.  'Put him on his guard, and
watch for him.  You know the terms we are on, I see: his danger does not
shock you.'

'What has Heathcliff done to you?' I asked.  'In what has he wronged you,
to warrant this appalling hatred?  Wouldn't it be wiser to bid him quit
the house?'

'No!' thundered Earnshaw; 'should he offer to leave me, he's a dead man:
persuade him to attempt it, and you are a murderess!  Am I to lose _all_,
without a chance of retrieval?  Is Hareton to be a beggar?  Oh,
damnation!  I _will_ have it back; and I'll have _his_ gold too; and then
his blood; and hell shall have his soul!  It will be ten times blacker
with that guest than ever it was before!'

You've acquainted me, Ellen, with your old master's habits.  He is
clearly on the verge of madness: he was so last night at least.  I
shuddered to be near him, and thought on the servant's ill-bred
moroseness as comparatively agreeable.  He now recommenced his moody
walk, and I raised the latch, and escaped into the kitchen.  Joseph was
bending over the fire, peering into a large pan that swung above it; and
a wooden bowl of oatmeal stood on the settle close by.  The contents of
the pan began to boil, and he turned to plunge his hand into the bowl; I
conjectured that this preparation was probably for our supper, and, being
hungry, I resolved it should be eatable; so, crying out sharply, '_I'll_
make the porridge!'  I removed the vessel out of his reach, and proceeded
to take off my hat and riding-habit.  'Mr. Earnshaw,' I continued,
'directs me to wait on myself: I will.  I'm not going to act the lady
among you, for fear I should starve.'

'Gooid Lord!' he muttered, sitting down, and stroking his ribbed
stockings from the knee to the ankle.  'If there's to be fresh
ortherings--just when I getten used to two maisters, if I mun hev' a
_mistress_ set o'er my heead, it's like time to be flitting.  I niver
_did_ think to see t' day that I mud lave th' owld place--but I doubt
it's nigh at hand!'

This lamentation drew no notice from me: I went briskly to work, sighing
to remember a period when it would have been all merry fun; but compelled
speedily to drive off the remembrance.  It racked me to recall past
happiness and the greater peril there was of conjuring up its apparition,
the quicker the thible ran round, and the faster the handfuls of meal
fell into the water.  Joseph beheld my style of cookery with growing
indignation.

'Thear!' he ejaculated.  'Hareton, thou willn't sup thy porridge
to-neeght; they'll be naught but lumps as big as my neive.  Thear, agean!
I'd fling in bowl un' all, if I wer ye!  There, pale t' guilp off, un'
then ye'll hae done wi' 't.  Bang, bang.  It's a mercy t' bothom isn't
deaved out!'

It _was_ rather a rough mess, I own, when poured into the basins; four
had been provided, and a gallon pitcher of new milk was brought from the
dairy, which Hareton seized and commenced drinking and spilling from the
expansive lip.  I expostulated, and desired that he should have his in a
mug; affirming that I could not taste the liquid treated so dirtily.  The
old cynic chose to be vastly offended at this nicety; assuring me,
repeatedly, that 'the barn was every bit as good' as I, 'and every bit as
wollsome,' and wondering how I could fashion to be so conceited.
Meanwhile, the infant ruffian continued sucking; and glowered up at me
defyingly, as he slavered into the jug.

'I shall have my supper in another room,' I said.  'Have you no place you
call a parlour?'

'_Parlour_!' he echoed, sneeringly, '_parlour_!  Nay, we've noa
_parlours_.  If yah dunnut loike wer company, there's maister's; un' if
yah dunnut loike maister, there's us.'

'Then I shall go up-stairs,' I answered; 'show me a chamber.'

I put my basin on a tray, and went myself to fetch some more milk.  With
great grumblings, the fellow rose, and preceded me in my ascent: we
mounted to the garrets; he opened a door, now and then, to look into the
apartments we passed.

'Here's a rahm,' he said, at last, flinging back a cranky board on
hinges.  'It's weel eneugh to ate a few porridge in.  There's a pack o'
corn i' t' corner, thear, meeterly clane; if ye're feared o' muckying yer
grand silk cloes, spread yer hankerchir o' t' top on't.'

The 'rahm' was a kind of lumber-hole smelling strong of malt and grain;
various sacks of which articles were piled around, leaving a wide, bare
space in the middle.

'Why, man,' I exclaimed, facing him angrily, 'this is not a place to
sleep in.  I wish to see my bed-room.'

'_Bed-rume_!' he repeated, in a tone of mockery. 'Yah's see all t'
_bed-rumes_ thear is--yon's mine.'

He pointed into the second garret, only differing from the first in being
more naked about the walls, and having a large, low, curtainless bed,
with an indigo-coloured quilt, at one end.

'What do I want with yours?' I retorted.  'I suppose Mr. Heathcliff does
not lodge at the top of the house, does he?'

'Oh! it's Maister _Hathecliff's_ ye're wanting?' cried he, as if making a
new discovery.  'Couldn't ye ha' said soa, at onst? un' then, I mud ha'
telled ye, baht all this wark, that that's just one ye cannut see--he
allas keeps it locked, un' nob'dy iver mells on't but hisseln.'

'You've a nice house, Joseph,' I could not refrain from observing, 'and
pleasant inmates; and I think the concentrated essence of all the madness
in the world took up its abode in my brain the day I linked my fate with
theirs!  However, that is not to the present purpose--there are other
rooms.  For heaven's sake be quick, and let me settle somewhere!'

He made no reply to this adjuration; only plodding doggedly down the
wooden steps, and halting, before an apartment which, from that halt and
the superior quality of its furniture, I conjectured to be the best one.
There was a carpet--a good one, but the pattern was obliterated by dust;
a fireplace hung with cut-paper, dropping to pieces; a handsome
oak-bedstead with ample crimson curtains of rather expensive material and
modern make; but they had evidently experienced rough usage: the
vallances hung in festoons, wrenched from their rings, and the iron rod
supporting them was bent in an arc on one side, causing the drapery to
trail upon the floor.  The chairs were also damaged, many of them
severely; and deep indentations deformed the panels of the walls.  I was
endeavouring to gather resolution for entering and taking possession,
when my fool of a guide announced,--'This here is t' maister's.'  My
supper by this time was cold, my appetite gone, and my patience
exhausted.  I insisted on being provided instantly with a place of
refuge, and means of repose.

'Whear the divil?' began the religious elder.  'The Lord bless us!  The
Lord forgie us!  Whear the _hell_ wold ye gang? ye marred, wearisome
nowt!  Ye've seen all but Hareton's bit of a cham'er.  There's not
another hoile to lig down in i' th' hahse!'

I was so vexed, I flung my tray and its contents on the ground; and then
seated myself at the stairs'-head, hid my face in my hands, and cried.

'Ech! ech!' exclaimed Joseph.  'Weel done, Miss Cathy! weel done, Miss
Cathy!  Howsiver, t' maister sall just tum'le o'er them brooken pots; un'
then we's hear summut; we's hear how it's to be.  Gooid-for-naught
madling! ye desarve pining fro' this to Chrustmas, flinging t' precious
gifts o'God under fooit i' yer flaysome rages!  But I'm mista'en if ye
shew yer sperrit lang.  Will Hathecliff bide sich bonny ways, think ye? I
nobbut wish he may catch ye i' that plisky.  I nobbut wish he may.'

And so he went on scolding to his den beneath, taking the candle with
him; and I remained in the dark. The period of reflection succeeding
this silly action compelled me to admit the necessity of smothering my
pride and choking my wrath, and bestirring myself to remove its effects.
An unexpected aid presently appeared in the shape of Throttler, whom I
now recognised as a son of our old Skulker: it had spent its whelphood
at the Grange, and was given by my father to Mr. Hindley. I fancy it
knew me: it pushed its nose against mine by way of salute, and then
hastened to devour the porridge; while I groped from step to step,
collecting the shattered earthenware, and drying the spatters of milk
from the banister with my pocket-handkerchief. Our labours were scarcely
over when I heard Earnshaw's tread in the passage; my assistant tucked
in his tail, and pressed to the wall; I stole into the nearest doorway.
The dog's endeavour to avoid him was unsuccessful; as I guessed by a
scutter down-stairs, and a prolonged, piteous yelping. I had better
luck: he passed on, entered his chamber, and shut the door. Directly
after Joseph came up with Hareton, to put him to bed. I had found
shelter in Hareton's room, and the old man, on seeing me, said,--'They's
rahm for boath ye un' yer pride, now, I sud think i' the hahse. It's
empty; ye may hev' it all to yerseln, un' Him as allus maks a third, i'
sich ill company!'

Gladly did I take advantage of this intimation; and the minute I flung
myself into a chair, by the fire, I nodded, and slept.  My slumber was
deep and sweet, though over far too soon.  Mr. Heathcliff awoke me; he
had just come in, and demanded, in his loving manner, what I was doing
there?  I told him the cause of my staying up so late--that he had the
key of our room in his pocket.  The adjective _our_ gave mortal offence.
He swore it was not, nor ever should be, mine; and he'd--but I'll not
repeat his language, nor describe his habitual conduct: he is ingenious
and unresting in seeking to gain my abhorrence!  I sometimes wonder at
him with an intensity that deadens my fear: yet, I assure you, a tiger or
a venomous serpent could not rouse terror in me equal to that which he
wakens.  He told me of Catherine's illness, and accused my brother of
causing it promising that I should be Edgar's proxy in suffering, till he
could get hold of him.

I do hate him--I am wretched--I have been a fool!  Beware of uttering one
breath of this to any one at the Grange.  I shall expect you every
day--don't disappoint me!--ISABELLA.




CHAPTER XIV


As soon as I had perused this epistle I went to the master, and informed
him that his sister had arrived at the Heights, and sent me a letter
expressing her sorrow for Mrs. Linton's situation, and her ardent desire
to see him; with a wish that he would transmit to her, as early as
possible, some token of forgiveness by me.

'Forgiveness!' said Linton.  'I have nothing to forgive her, Ellen.  You
may call at Wuthering Heights this afternoon, if you like, and say that I
am not angry, but I'm sorry to have lost her; especially as I can never
think she'll be happy.  It is out of the question my going to see her,
however: we are eternally divided; and should she really wish to oblige
me, let her persuade the villain she has married to leave the country.'

'And you won't write her a little note, sir?' I asked, imploringly.

'No,' he answered.  'It is needless.  My communication with Heathcliff's
family shall be as sparing as his with mine.  It shall not exist!'

Mr. Edgar's coldness depressed me exceedingly; and all the way from the
Grange I puzzled my brains how to put more heart into what he said, when
I repeated it; and how to soften his refusal of even a few lines to
console Isabella. I daresay she had been on the watch for me since
morning: I saw her looking through the lattice as I came up the garden
causeway, and I nodded to her; but she drew back, as if afraid of being
observed. I entered without knocking. There never was such a dreary,
dismal scene as the formerly cheerful house presented! I must confess,
that if I had been in the young lady's place, I would, at least, have
swept the hearth, and wiped the tables with a duster. But she already
partook of the pervading spirit of neglect which encompassed her. Her
pretty face was wan and listless; her hair uncurled: some locks hanging
lankly down, and some carelessly twisted round her head. Probably she
had not touched her dress since yester evening. Hindley was not there.
Mr. Heathcliff sat at a table, turning over some papers in his
pocket-book; but he rose when I appeared, asked me how I did, quite
friendly, and offered me a chair. He was the only thing there that
seemed decent; and I thought he never looked better. So much had
circumstances altered their positions, that he would certainly have
struck a stranger as a born and bred gentleman; and his wife as a
thorough little slattern! She came forward eagerly to greet me, and held
out one hand to take the expected letter. I shook my head. She wouldn't
understand the hint, but followed me to a sideboard, where I went to lay
my bonnet, and importuned me in a whisper to give her directly what I
had brought. Heathcliff guessed the meaning of her manoeuvres, and
said--'If you have got anything for Isabella (as no doubt you have,
Nelly), give it to her. You needn't make a secret of it: we have no
secrets between us.'

'Oh, I have nothing,' I replied, thinking it best to speak the truth at
once.  'My master bid me tell his sister that she must not expect either
a letter or a visit from him at present.  He sends his love, ma'am, and
his wishes for your happiness, and his pardon for the grief you have
occasioned; but he thinks that after this time his household and the
household here should drop intercommunication, as nothing could come of
keeping it up.'

Mrs. Heathcliff's lip quivered slightly, and she returned to her seat in
the window.  Her husband took his stand on the hearthstone, near me, and
began to put questions concerning Catherine.  I told him as much as I
thought proper of her illness, and he extorted from me, by
cross-examination, most of the facts connected with its origin.  I blamed
her, as she deserved, for bringing it all on herself; and ended by hoping
that he would follow Mr. Linton's example and avoid future interference
with his family, for good or evil.

'Mrs. Linton is now just recovering,' I said; 'she'll never be like she
was, but her life is spared; and if you really have a regard for her,
you'll shun crossing her way again: nay, you'll move out of this country
entirely; and that you may not regret it, I'll inform you Catherine
Linton is as different now from your old friend Catherine Earnshaw, as
that young lady is different from me.  Her appearance is changed greatly,
her character much more so; and the person who is compelled, of
necessity, to be her companion, will only sustain his affection hereafter
by the remembrance of what she once was, by common humanity, and a sense
of duty!'

'That is quite possible,' remarked Heathcliff, forcing himself to seem
calm: 'quite possible that your master should have nothing but common
humanity and a sense of duty to fall back upon.  But do you imagine that
I shall leave Catherine to his _duty_ and _humanity_? and can you compare
my feelings respecting Catherine to his?  Before you leave this house, I
must exact a promise from you that you'll get me an interview with her:
consent, or refuse, I _will_ see her!  What do you say?'

'I say, Mr. Heathcliff,' I replied, 'you must not: you never shall,
through my means.  Another encounter between you and the master would
kill her altogether.'

'With your aid that may be avoided,' he continued; 'and should there be
danger of such an event--should he be the cause of adding a single
trouble more to her existence--why, I think I shall be justified in going
to extremes!  I wish you had sincerity enough to tell me whether
Catherine would suffer greatly from his loss: the fear that she would
restrains me.  And there you see the distinction between our feelings:
had he been in my place, and I in his, though I hated him with a hatred
that turned my life to gall, I never would have raised a hand against
him.  You may look incredulous, if you please!  I never would have
banished him from her society as long as she desired his.  The moment her
regard ceased, I would have torn his heart out, and drunk his blood!  But,
till then--if you don't believe me, you don't know me--till then, I would
have died by inches before I touched a single hair of his head!'

'And yet,' I interrupted, 'you have no scruples in completely ruining all
hopes of her perfect restoration, by thrusting yourself into her
remembrance now, when she has nearly forgotten you, and involving her in
a new tumult of discord and distress.'

'You suppose she has nearly forgotten me?' he said.  'Oh, Nelly! you know
she has not!  You know as well as I do, that for every thought she spends
on Linton she spends a thousand on me!  At a most miserable period of my
life, I had a notion of the kind: it haunted me on my return to the
neighbourhood last summer; but only her own assurance could make me admit
the horrible idea again.  And then, Linton would be nothing, nor Hindley,
nor all the dreams that ever I dreamt.  Two words would comprehend my
future--_death_ and _hell_: existence, after losing her, would be hell.
Yet I was a fool to fancy for a moment that she valued Edgar Linton's
attachment more than mine.  If he loved with all the powers of his puny
being, he couldn't love as much in eighty years as I could in a day.  And
Catherine has a heart as deep as I have: the sea could be as readily
contained in that horse-trough as her whole affection be monopolised by
him.  Tush!  He is scarcely a degree dearer to her than her dog, or her
horse.  It is not in him to be loved like me: how can she love in him
what he has not?'

'Catherine and Edgar are as fond of each other as any two people can be,'
cried Isabella, with sudden vivacity.  'No one has a right to talk in
that manner, and I won't hear my brother depreciated in silence!'

'Your brother is wondrous fond of you too, isn't he?' observed
Heathcliff, scornfully.  'He turns you adrift on the world with
surprising alacrity.'

'He is not aware of what I suffer,' she replied.  'I didn't tell him
that.'

'You have been telling him something, then: you have written, have you?'

'To say that I was married, I did write--you saw the note.'

'And nothing since?'

'No.'

'My young lady is looking sadly the worse for her change of condition,' I
remarked.  'Somebody's love comes short in her case, obviously; whose, I
may guess; but, perhaps, I shouldn't say.'

'I should guess it was her own,' said Heathcliff.  'She degenerates into
a mere slut!  She is tired of trying to please me uncommonly early.  You'd
hardly credit it, but the very morrow of our wedding she was weeping to
go home.  However, she'll suit this house so much the better for not
being over nice, and I'll take care she does not disgrace me by rambling
abroad.'

'Well, sir,' returned I, 'I hope you'll consider that Mrs. Heathcliff is
accustomed to be looked after and waited on; and that she has been
brought up like an only daughter, whom every one was ready to serve.  You
must let her have a maid to keep things tidy about her, and you must
treat her kindly.  Whatever be your notion of Mr. Edgar, you cannot doubt
that she has a capacity for strong attachments, or she wouldn't have
abandoned the elegancies, and comforts, and friends of her former home,
to fix contentedly, in such a wilderness as this, with you.'

'She abandoned them under a delusion,' he answered; 'picturing in me a
hero of romance, and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous
devotion.  I can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature,
so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my
character and acting on the false impressions she cherished.  But, at
last, I think she begins to know me: I don't perceive the silly smiles
and grimaces that provoked me at first; and the senseless incapability of
discerning that I was in earnest when I gave her my opinion of her
infatuation and herself.  It was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to
discover that I did not love her.  I believed, at one time, no lessons
could teach her that!  And yet it is poorly learnt; for this morning she
announced, as a piece of appalling intelligence, that I had actually
succeeded in making her hate me!  A positive labour of Hercules, I assure
you!  If it be achieved, I have cause to return thanks.  Can I trust your
assertion, Isabella?  Are you sure you hate me?  If I let you alone for
half a day, won't you come sighing and wheedling to me again?  I daresay
she would rather I had seemed all tenderness before you: it wounds her
vanity to have the truth exposed.  But I don't care who knows that the
passion was wholly on one side: and I never told her a lie about it.  She
cannot accuse me of showing one bit of deceitful softness.  The first
thing she saw me do, on coming out of the Grange, was to hang up her
little dog; and when she pleaded for it, the first words I uttered were a
wish that I had the hanging of every being belonging to her, except one:
possibly she took that exception for herself.  But no brutality disgusted
her: I suppose she has an innate admiration of it, if only her precious
person were secure from injury!  Now, was it not the depth of
absurdity--of genuine idiotcy, for that pitiful, slavish, mean-minded
brach to dream that I could love her?  Tell your master, Nelly, that I
never, in all my life, met with such an abject thing as she is.  She even
disgraces the name of Linton; and I've sometimes relented, from pure lack
of invention, in my experiments on what she could endure, and still creep
shamefully cringing back!  But tell him, also, to set his fraternal and
magisterial heart at ease: that I keep strictly within the limits of the
law.  I have avoided, up to this period, giving her the slightest right
to claim a separation; and, what's more, she'd thank nobody for dividing
us.  If she desired to go, she might: the nuisance of her presence
outweighs the gratification to be derived from tormenting her!'

'Mr. Heathcliff,' said I, 'this is the talk of a madman; your wife, most
likely, is convinced you are mad; and, for that reason, she has borne
with you hitherto: but now that you say she may go, she'll doubtless
avail herself of the permission.  You are not so bewitched, ma'am, are
you, as to remain with him of your own accord?'

'Take care, Ellen!' answered Isabella, her eyes sparkling irefully; there
was no misdoubting by their expression the full success of her partner's
endeavours to make himself detested.  'Don't put faith in a single word
he speaks.  He's a lying fiend! a monster, and not a human being!  I've
been told I might leave him before; and I've made the attempt, but I dare
not repeat it!  Only, Ellen, promise you'll not mention a syllable of his
infamous conversation to my brother or Catherine.  Whatever he may
pretend, he wishes to provoke Edgar to desperation: he says he has
married me on purpose to obtain power over him; and he sha'n't obtain
it--I'll die first!  I just hope, I pray, that he may forget his
diabolical prudence and kill me!  The single pleasure I can imagine is to
die, or to see him dead!'

'There--that will do for the present!' said Heathcliff.  'If you are
called upon in a court of law, you'll remember her language, Nelly!  And
take a good look at that countenance: she's near the point which would
suit me.  No; you're not fit to be your own guardian, Isabella, now; and
I, being your legal protector, must retain you in my custody, however
distasteful the obligation may be.  Go up-stairs; I have something to say
to Ellen Dean in private.  That's not the way: up-stairs, I tell you!
Why, this is the road upstairs, child!'

He seized, and thrust her from the room; and returned muttering--'I have
no pity!  I have no pity!  The more the worms writhe, the more I yearn to
crush out their entrails!  It is a moral teething; and I grind with
greater energy in proportion to the increase of pain.'

'Do you understand what the word pity means?' I said, hastening to resume
my bonnet.  'Did you ever feel a touch of it in your life?'

'Put that down!' he interrupted, perceiving my intention to depart.  'You
are not going yet.  Come here now, Nelly: I must either persuade or
compel you to aid me in fulfilling my determination to see Catherine, and
that without delay.  I swear that I meditate no harm: I don't desire to
cause any disturbance, or to exasperate or insult Mr. Linton; I only wish
to hear from herself how she is, and why she has been ill; and to ask if
anything that I could do would be of use to her.  Last night I was in the
Grange garden six hours, and I'll return there to-night; and every night
I'll haunt the place, and every day, till I find an opportunity of
entering.  If Edgar Linton meets me, I shall not hesitate to knock him
down, and give him enough to insure his quiescence while I stay.  If his
servants oppose me, I shall threaten them off with these pistols.  But
wouldn't it be better to prevent my coming in contact with them, or their
master?  And you could do it so easily.  I'd warn you when I came, and
then you might let me in unobserved, as soon as she was alone, and watch
till I departed, your conscience quite calm: you would be hindering
mischief.'

I protested against playing that treacherous part in my employer's house:
and, besides, I urged the cruelty and selfishness of his destroying Mrs.
Linton's tranquillity for his satisfaction.  'The commonest occurrence
startles her painfully,' I said.  'She's all nerves, and she couldn't
bear the surprise, I'm positive.  Don't persist, sir! or else I shall be
obliged to inform my master of your designs; and he'll take measures to
secure his house and its inmates from any such unwarrantable intrusions!'

'In that case I'll take measures to secure you, woman!' exclaimed
Heathcliff; 'you shall not leave Wuthering Heights till to-morrow
morning.  It is a foolish story to assert that Catherine could not bear
to see me; and as to surprising her, I don't desire it: you must prepare
her--ask her if I may come.  You say she never mentions my name, and that
I am never mentioned to her.  To whom should she mention me if I am a
forbidden topic in the house?  She thinks you are all spies for her
husband.  Oh, I've no doubt she's in hell among you!  I guess by her
silence, as much as anything, what she feels.  You say she is often
restless, and anxious-looking: is that a proof of tranquillity?  You talk
of her mind being unsettled.  How the devil could it be otherwise in her
frightful isolation?  And that insipid, paltry creature attending her
from _duty_ and _humanity_!  From _pity_ and _charity_!  He might as well
plant an oak in a flower-pot, and expect it to thrive, as imagine he can
restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares?  Let us settle it
at once: will you stay here, and am I to fight my way to Catherine over
Linton and his footman?  Or will you be my friend, as you have been
hitherto, and do what I request?  Decide! because there is no reason for
my lingering another minute, if you persist in your stubborn ill-nature!'

Well, Mr. Lockwood, I argued and complained, and flatly refused him fifty
times; but in the long run he forced me to an agreement.  I engaged to
carry a letter from him to my mistress; and should she consent, I
promised to let him have intelligence of Linton's next absence from home,
when he might come, and get in as he was able: I wouldn't be there, and
my fellow-servants should be equally out of the way.  Was it right or
wrong?  I fear it was wrong, though expedient.  I thought I prevented
another explosion by my compliance; and I thought, too, it might create a
favourable crisis in Catherine's mental illness: and then I remembered
Mr. Edgar's stern rebuke of my carrying tales; and I tried to smooth away
all disquietude on the subject, by affirming, with frequent iteration,
that that betrayal of trust, if it merited so harsh an appellation,
should be the last.  Notwithstanding, my journey homeward was sadder than
my journey thither; and many misgivings I had, ere I could prevail on
myself to put the missive into Mrs. Linton's hand.

But here is Kenneth; I'll go down, and tell him how much better you are.
My history is _dree_, as we say, and will serve to while away another
morning.

Dree, and dreary!  I reflected as the good woman descended to receive the
doctor: and not exactly of the kind which I should have chosen to amuse
me.  But never mind!  I'll extract wholesome medicines from Mrs. Dean's
bitter herbs; and firstly, let me beware of the fascination that lurks in
Catherine Heathcliff's brilliant eyes.  I should be in a curious taking
if I surrendered my heart to that young person, and the daughter turned
out a second edition of the mother.




CHAPTER XV


Another week over--and I am so many days nearer health, and spring!  I
have now heard all my neighbour's history, at different sittings, as the
housekeeper could spare time from more important occupations.  I'll
continue it in her own words, only a little condensed.  She is, on the
whole, a very fair narrator, and I don't think I could improve her style.

In the evening, she said, the evening of my visit to the Heights, I knew,
as well as if I saw him, that Mr. Heathcliff was about the place; and I
shunned going out, because I still carried his letter in my pocket, and
didn't want to be threatened or teased any more.  I had made up my mind
not to give it till my master went somewhere, as I could not guess how
its receipt would affect Catherine.  The consequence was, that it did not
reach her before the lapse of three days.  The fourth was Sunday, and I
brought it into her room after the family were gone to church.  There was
a manservant left to keep the house with me, and we generally made a
practice of locking the doors during the hours of service; but on that
occasion the weather was so warm and pleasant that I set them wide open,
and, to fulfil my engagement, as I knew who would be coming, I told my
companion that the mistress wished very much for some oranges, and he
must run over to the village and get a few, to be paid for on the morrow.
He departed, and I went up-stairs.

Mrs. Linton sat in a loose white dress, with a light shawl over her
shoulders, in the recess of the open window, as usual.  Her thick, long
hair had been partly removed at the beginning of her illness, and now she
wore it simply combed in its natural tresses over her temples and neck.
Her appearance was altered, as I had told Heathcliff; but when she was
calm, there seemed unearthly beauty in the change.  The flash of her eyes
had been succeeded by a dreamy and melancholy softness; they no longer
gave the impression of looking at the objects around her: they appeared
always to gaze beyond, and far beyond--you would have said out of this
world.  Then, the paleness of her face--its haggard aspect having
vanished as she recovered flesh--and the peculiar expression arising from
her mental state, though painfully suggestive of their causes, added to
the touching interest which she awakened; and--invariably to me, I know,
and to any person who saw her, I should think--refuted more tangible
proofs of convalescence, and stamped her as one doomed to decay.

A book lay spread on the sill before her, and the scarcely perceptible
wind fluttered its leaves at intervals.  I believe Linton had laid it
there: for she never endeavoured to divert herself with reading, or
occupation of any kind, and he would spend many an hour in trying to
entice her attention to some subject which had formerly been her
amusement.  She was conscious of his aim, and in her better moods endured
his efforts placidly, only showing their uselessness by now and then
suppressing a wearied sigh, and checking him at last with the saddest of
smiles and kisses.  At other times, she would turn petulantly away, and
hide her face in her hands, or even push him off angrily; and then he
took care to let her alone, for he was certain of doing no good.

Gimmerton chapel bells were still ringing; and the full, mellow flow of
the beck in the valley came soothingly on the ear.  It was a sweet
substitute for the yet absent murmur of the summer foliage, which drowned
that music about the Grange when the trees were in leaf.  At Wuthering
Heights it always sounded on quiet days following a great thaw or a
season of steady rain.  And of Wuthering Heights Catherine was thinking
as she listened: that is, if she thought or listened at all; but she had
the vague, distant look I mentioned before, which expressed no
recognition of material things either by ear or eye.

'There's a letter for you, Mrs. Linton,' I said, gently inserting it in
one hand that rested on her knee.  'You must read it immediately, because
it wants an answer.  Shall I break the seal?'  'Yes,' she answered,
without altering the direction of her eyes.  I opened it--it was very
short.  'Now,' I continued, 'read it.'  She drew away her hand, and let
it fall.  I replaced it in her lap, and stood waiting till it should
please her to glance down; but that movement was so long delayed that at
last I resumed--'Must I read it, ma'am?  It is from Mr. Heathcliff.'

There was a start and a troubled gleam of recollection, and a struggle to
arrange her ideas.  She lifted the letter, and seemed to peruse it; and
when she came to the signature she sighed: yet still I found she had not
gathered its import, for, upon my desiring to hear her reply, she merely
pointed to the name, and gazed at me with mournful and questioning
eagerness.

'Well, he wishes to see you,' said I, guessing her need of an
interpreter.  'He's in the garden by this time, and impatient to know
what answer I shall bring.'

As I spoke, I observed a large dog lying on the sunny grass beneath raise
its ears as if about to bark, and then smoothing them back, announce, by
a wag of the tail, that some one approached whom it did not consider a
stranger.  Mrs. Linton bent forward, and listened breathlessly.  The
minute after a step traversed the hall; the open house was too tempting
for Heathcliff to resist walking in: most likely he supposed that I was
inclined to shirk my promise, and so resolved to trust to his own
audacity.  With straining eagerness Catherine gazed towards the entrance
of her chamber.  He did not hit the right room directly: she motioned me
to admit him, but he found it out ere I could reach the door, and in a
stride or two was at her side, and had her grasped in his arms.

He neither spoke nor loosed his hold for some five minutes, during which
period he bestowed more kisses than ever he gave in his life before, I
daresay: but then my mistress had kissed him first, and I plainly saw
that he could hardly bear, for downright agony, to look into her face!
The same conviction had stricken him as me, from the instant he beheld
her, that there was no prospect of ultimate recovery there--she was
fated, sure to die.

'Oh, Cathy!  Oh, my life! how can I bear it?' was the first sentence he
uttered, in a tone that did not seek to disguise his despair.  And now he
stared at her so earnestly that I thought the very intensity of his gaze
would bring tears into his eyes; but they burned with anguish: they did
not melt.

'What now?' said Catherine, leaning back, and returning his look with a
suddenly clouded brow: her humour was a mere vane for constantly varying
caprices.  'You and Edgar have broken my heart, Heathcliff!  And you both
come to bewail the deed to me, as if you were the people to be pitied!  I
shall not pity you, not I.  You have killed me--and thriven on it, I
think.  How strong you are!  How many years do you mean to live after I
am gone?'

Heathcliff had knelt on one knee to embrace her; he attempted to rise,
but she seized his hair, and kept him down.

'I wish I could hold you,' she continued, bitterly, 'till we were both
dead!  I shouldn't care what you suffered.  I care nothing for your
sufferings.  Why shouldn't you suffer?  I do!  Will you forget me?  Will
you be happy when I am in the earth?  Will you say twenty years hence,
"That's the grave of Catherine Earnshaw?  I loved her long ago, and was
wretched to lose her; but it is past.  I've loved many others since: my
children are dearer to me than she was; and, at death, I shall not
rejoice that I am going to her: I shall be sorry that I must leave
them!"  Will you say so, Heathcliff?'

'Don't torture me till I'm as mad as yourself,' cried he, wrenching his
head free, and grinding his teeth.

The two, to a cool spectator, made a strange and fearful picture.  Well
might Catherine deem that heaven would be a land of exile to her, unless
with her mortal body she cast away her moral character also.  Her present
countenance had a wild vindictiveness in its white cheek, and a bloodless
lip and scintillating eye; and she retained in her closed fingers a
portion of the locks she had been grasping.  As to her companion, while
raising himself with one hand, he had taken her arm with the other; and
so inadequate was his stock of gentleness to the requirements of her
condition, that on his letting go I saw four distinct impressions left
blue in the colourless skin.

'Are you possessed with a devil,' he pursued, savagely, 'to talk in that
manner to me when you are dying?  Do you reflect that all those words
will be branded in my memory, and eating deeper eternally after you have
left me?  You know you lie to say I have killed you: and, Catherine, you
know that I could as soon forget you as my existence!  Is it not
sufficient for your infernal selfishness, that while you are at peace I
shall writhe in the torments of hell?'

'I shall not be at peace,' moaned Catherine, recalled to a sense of
physical weakness by the violent, unequal throbbing of her heart, which
beat visibly and audibly under this excess of agitation.  She said
nothing further till the paroxysm was over; then she continued, more
kindly--

'I'm not wishing you greater torment than I have, Heathcliff.  I only
wish us never to be parted: and should a word of mine distress you
hereafter, think I feel the same distress underground, and for my own
sake, forgive me!  Come here and kneel down again!  You never harmed me
in your life.  Nay, if you nurse anger, that will be worse to remember
than my harsh words!  Won't you come here again?  Do!'

Heathcliff went to the back of her chair, and leant over, but not so far
as to let her see his face, which was livid with emotion.  She bent round
to look at him; he would not permit it: turning abruptly, he walked to
the fireplace, where he stood, silent, with his back towards us.  Mrs.
Linton's glance followed him suspiciously: every movement woke a new
sentiment in her.  After a pause and a prolonged gaze, she resumed;
addressing me in accents of indignant disappointment:--

'Oh, you see, Nelly, he would not relent a moment to keep me out of the
grave.  _That_ is how I'm loved!  Well, never mind.  That is not _my_
Heathcliff.  I shall love mine yet; and take him with me: he's in my
soul.  And,' added she musingly, 'the thing that irks me most is this
shattered prison, after all.  I'm tired of being enclosed here.  I'm
wearying to escape into that glorious world, and to be always there: not
seeing it dimly through tears, and yearning for it through the walls of
an aching heart: but really with it, and in it.  Nelly, you think you are
better and more fortunate than I; in full health and strength: you are
sorry for me--very soon that will be altered.  I shall be sorry for
_you_.  I shall be incomparably beyond and above you all.  I _wonder_ he
won't be near me!'  She went on to herself.  'I thought he wished it.
Heathcliff, dear! you should not be sullen now.  Do come to me,
Heathcliff.'

In her eagerness she rose and supported herself on the arm of the chair.
At that earnest appeal he turned to her, looking absolutely desperate.
His eyes, wide and wet, at last flashed fiercely on her; his breast
heaved convulsively.  An instant they held asunder, and then how they met
I hardly saw, but Catherine made a spring, and he caught her, and they
were locked in an embrace from which I thought my mistress would never be
released alive: in fact, to my eyes, she seemed directly insensible.  He
flung himself into the nearest seat, and on my approaching hurriedly to
ascertain if she had fainted, he gnashed at me, and foamed like a mad
dog, and gathered her to him with greedy jealousy.  I did not feel as if
I were in the company of a creature of my own species: it appeared that
he would not understand, though I spoke to him; so I stood off, and held
my tongue, in great perplexity.

A movement of Catherine's relieved me a little presently: she put up her
hand to clasp his neck, and bring her cheek to his as he held her; while
he, in return, covering her with frantic caresses, said wildly--

'You teach me now how cruel you've been--cruel and false.  _Why_ did you
despise me?  _Why_ did you betray your own heart, Cathy?  I have not one
word of comfort.  You deserve this.  You have killed yourself.  Yes, you
may kiss me, and cry; and wring out my kisses and tears: they'll blight
you--they'll damn you.  You loved me--then what _right_ had you to leave
me?  What right--answer me--for the poor fancy you felt for Linton?
Because misery and degradation, and death, and nothing that God or Satan
could inflict would have parted us, _you_, of your own will, did it.  I
have not broken your heart--_you_ have broken it; and in breaking it, you
have broken mine.  So much the worse for me that I am strong.  Do I want
to live?  What kind of living will it be when you--oh, God! would _you_
like to live with your soul in the grave?'

'Let me alone.  Let me alone,' sobbed Catherine.  'If I've done wrong,
I'm dying for it.  It is enough!  You left me too: but I won't upbraid
you!  I forgive you.  Forgive me!'

'It is hard to forgive, and to look at those eyes, and feel those wasted
hands,' he answered.  'Kiss me again; and don't let me see your eyes!  I
forgive what you have done to me.  I love _my_ murderer--but _yours_!  How
can I?'

They were silent--their faces hid against each other, and washed by each
other's tears.  At least, I suppose the weeping was on both sides; as it
seemed Heathcliff could weep on a great occasion like this.

I grew very uncomfortable, meanwhile; for the afternoon wore fast away,
the man whom I had sent off returned from his errand, and I could
distinguish, by the shine of the western sun up the valley, a concourse
thickening outside Gimmerton chapel porch.

'Service is over,' I announced.  'My master will be here in half an
hour.'

Heathcliff groaned a curse, and strained Catherine closer: she never
moved.

Ere long I perceived a group of the servants passing up the road towards
the kitchen wing.  Mr. Linton was not far behind; he opened the gate
himself and sauntered slowly up, probably enjoying the lovely afternoon
that breathed as soft as summer.

'Now he is here,' I exclaimed.  'For heaven's sake, hurry down!  You'll
not meet any one on the front stairs.  Do be quick; and stay among the
trees till he is fairly in.'

'I must go, Cathy,' said Heathcliff, seeking to extricate himself from
his companion's arms.  'But if I live, I'll see you again before you are
asleep.  I won't stray five yards from your window.'

'You must not go!' she answered, holding him as firmly as her strength
allowed.  'You _shall_ not, I tell you.'

'For one hour,' he pleaded earnestly.

'Not for one minute,' she replied.

'I _must_--Linton will be up immediately,' persisted the alarmed
intruder.

He would have risen, and unfixed her fingers by the act--she clung fast,
gasping: there was mad resolution in her face.

'No!' she shrieked.  'Oh, don't, don't go.  It is the last time!  Edgar
will not hurt us.  Heathcliff, I shall die!  I shall die!'

'Damn the fool!  There he is,' cried Heathcliff, sinking back into his
seat.  'Hush, my darling!  Hush, hush, Catherine!  I'll stay.  If he shot
me so, I'd expire with a blessing on my lips.'

And there they were fast again.  I heard my master mounting the
stairs--the cold sweat ran from my forehead: I was horrified.

'Are you going to listen to her ravings?' I said, passionately.  'She
does not know what she says.  Will you ruin her, because she has not wit
to help herself?  Get up!  You could be free instantly.  That is the most
diabolical deed that ever you did.  We are all done for--master,
mistress, and servant.'

I wrung my hands, and cried out; and Mr. Linton hastened his step at the
noise.  In the midst of my agitation, I was sincerely glad to observe
that Catherine's arms had fallen relaxed, and her head hung down.

'She's fainted, or dead,' I thought: 'so much the better.  Far better
that she should be dead, than lingering a burden and a misery-maker to
all about her.'

Edgar sprang to his unbidden guest, blanched with astonishment and rage.
What he meant to do I cannot tell; however, the other stopped all
demonstrations, at once, by placing the lifeless-looking form in his
arms.

'Look there!' he said.  'Unless you be a fiend, help her first--then you
shall speak to me!'

He walked into the parlour, and sat down.  Mr. Linton summoned me, and
with great difficulty, and after resorting to many means, we managed to
restore her to sensation; but she was all bewildered; she sighed, and
moaned, and knew nobody.  Edgar, in his anxiety for her, forgot her hated
friend.  I did not.  I went, at the earliest opportunity, and besought
him to depart; affirming that Catherine was better, and he should hear
from me in the morning how she passed the night.

'I shall not refuse to go out of doors,' he answered; 'but I shall stay
in the garden: and, Nelly, mind you keep your word to-morrow.  I shall be
under those larch-trees.  Mind! or I pay another visit, whether Linton be
in or not.'

He sent a rapid glance through the half-open door of the chamber, and,
ascertaining that what I stated was apparently true, delivered the house
of his luckless presence.




CHAPTER XVI


About twelve o'clock that night was born the Catherine you saw at
Wuthering Heights: a puny, seven-months' child; and two hours after the
mother died, having never recovered sufficient consciousness to miss
Heathcliff, or know Edgar.  The latter's distraction at his bereavement
is a subject too painful to be dwelt on; its after-effects showed how
deep the sorrow sunk.  A great addition, in my eyes, was his being left
without an heir.  I bemoaned that, as I gazed on the feeble orphan; and I
mentally abused old Linton for (what was only natural partiality) the
securing his estate to his own daughter, instead of his son's.  An
unwelcomed infant it was, poor thing!  It might have wailed out of life,
and nobody cared a morsel, during those first hours of existence.  We
redeemed the neglect afterwards; but its beginning was as friendless as
its end is likely to be.

Next morning--bright and cheerful out of doors--stole softened in through
the blinds of the silent room, and suffused the couch and its occupant
with a mellow, tender glow.  Edgar Linton had his head laid on the
pillow, and his eyes shut.  His young and fair features were almost as
deathlike as those of the form beside him, and almost as fixed: but _his_
was the hush of exhausted anguish, and _hers_ of perfect peace.  Her brow
smooth, her lids closed, her lips wearing the expression of a smile; no
angel in heaven could be more beautiful than she appeared.  And I partook
of the infinite calm in which she lay: my mind was never in a holier
frame than while I gazed on that untroubled image of Divine rest.  I
instinctively echoed the words she had uttered a few hours before:
'Incomparably beyond and above us all!  Whether still on earth or now in
heaven, her spirit is at home with God!'

I don't know if it be a peculiarity in me, but I am seldom otherwise than
happy while watching in the chamber of death, should no frenzied or
despairing mourner share the duty with me.  I see a repose that neither
earth nor hell can break, and I feel an assurance of the endless and
shadowless hereafter--the Eternity they have entered--where life is
boundless in its duration, and love in its sympathy, and joy in its
fulness.  I noticed on that occasion how much selfishness there is even
in a love like Mr. Linton's, when he so regretted Catherine's blessed
release!  To be sure, one might have doubted, after the wayward and
impatient existence she had led, whether she merited a haven of peace at
last.  One might doubt in seasons of cold reflection; but not then, in
the presence of her corpse.  It asserted its own tranquillity, which
seemed a pledge of equal quiet to its former inhabitant.

Do you believe such people are happy in the other world, sir?  I'd give a
great deal to know.

I declined answering Mrs. Dean's question, which struck me as something
heterodox.  She proceeded:

Retracing the course of Catherine Linton, I fear we have no right to
think she is; but we'll leave her with her Maker.

The master looked asleep, and I ventured soon after sunrise to quit the
room and steal out to the pure refreshing air.  The servants thought me
gone to shake off the drowsiness of my protracted watch; in reality, my
chief motive was seeing Mr. Heathcliff.  If he had remained among the
larches all night, he would have heard nothing of the stir at the Grange;
unless, perhaps, he might catch the gallop of the messenger going to
Gimmerton.  If he had come nearer, he would probably be aware, from the
lights flitting to and fro, and the opening and shutting of the outer
doors, that all was not right within.  I wished, yet feared, to find him.
I felt the terrible news must be told, and I longed to get it over; but
how to do it I did not know.  He was there--at least, a few yards further
in the park; leant against an old ash-tree, his hat off, and his hair
soaked with the dew that had gathered on the budded branches, and fell
pattering round him.  He had been standing a long time in that position,
for I saw a pair of ousels passing and repassing scarcely three feet from
him, busy in building their nest, and regarding his proximity no more
than that of a piece of timber.  They flew off at my approach, and he
raised his eyes and spoke:--'She's dead!' he said; 'I've not waited for
you to learn that.  Put your handkerchief away--don't snivel before me.
Damn you all! she wants none of your tears!'

I was weeping as much for him as her: we do sometimes pity creatures that
have none of the feeling either for themselves or others.  When I first
looked into his face, I perceived that he had got intelligence of the
catastrophe; and a foolish notion struck me that his heart was quelled
and he prayed, because his lips moved and his gaze was bent on the
ground.

'Yes, she's dead!' I answered, checking my sobs and drying my cheeks.
'Gone to heaven, I hope; where we may, every one, join her, if we take
due warning and leave our evil ways to follow good!'

'Did _she_ take due warning, then?' asked Heathcliff, attempting a sneer.
'Did she die like a saint?  Come, give me a true history of the event.
How did--?'

He endeavoured to pronounce the name, but could not manage it; and
compressing his mouth he held a silent combat with his inward agony,
defying, meanwhile, my sympathy with an unflinching, ferocious stare.
'How did she die?' he resumed, at last--fain, notwithstanding his
hardihood, to have a support behind him; for, after the struggle, he
trembled, in spite of himself, to his very finger-ends.

'Poor wretch!' I thought; 'you have a heart and nerves the same as your
brother men!  Why should you be anxious to conceal them?  Your pride
cannot blind God!  You tempt him to wring them, till he forces a cry of
humiliation.'

'Quietly as a lamb!' I answered, aloud.  'She drew a sigh, and stretched
herself, like a child reviving, and sinking again to sleep; and five
minutes after I felt one little pulse at her heart, and nothing more!'

'And--did she ever mention me?' he asked, hesitating, as if he dreaded
the answer to his question would introduce details that he could not bear
to hear.

'Her senses never returned: she recognised nobody from the time you left
her,' I said.  'She lies with a sweet smile on her face; and her latest
ideas wandered back to pleasant early days.  Her life closed in a gentle
dream--may she wake as kindly in the other world!'

'May she wake in torment!' he cried, with frightful vehemence, stamping
his foot, and groaning in a sudden paroxysm of ungovernable passion.
'Why, she's a liar to the end!  Where is she?  Not _there_--not in
heaven--not perished--where?  Oh! you said you cared nothing for my
sufferings!  And I pray one prayer--I repeat it till my tongue
stiffens--Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest as long as I am living;
you said I killed you--haunt me, then!  The murdered _do_ haunt their
murderers, I believe.  I know that ghosts _have_ wandered on earth.  Be
with me always--take any form--drive me mad! only _do_ not leave me in
this abyss, where I cannot find you!  Oh, God! it is unutterable!  I
_cannot_ live without my life!  I _cannot_ live without my soul!'

He dashed his head against the knotted trunk; and, lifting up his eyes,
howled, not like a man, but like a savage beast being goaded to death
with knives and spears.  I observed several splashes of blood about the
bark of the tree, and his hand and forehead were both stained; probably
the scene I witnessed was a repetition of others acted during the night.
It hardly moved my compassion--it appalled me: still, I felt reluctant to
quit him so.  But the moment he recollected himself enough to notice me
watching, he thundered a command for me to go, and I obeyed.  He was
beyond my skill to quiet or console!

Mrs. Linton's funeral was appointed to take place on the Friday following
her decease; and till then her coffin remained uncovered, and strewn with
flowers and scented leaves, in the great drawing-room.  Linton spent his
days and nights there, a sleepless guardian; and--a circumstance
concealed from all but me--Heathcliff spent his nights, at least,
outside, equally a stranger to repose.  I held no communication with him:
still, I was conscious of his design to enter, if he could; and on the
Tuesday, a little after dark, when my master, from sheer fatigue, had
been compelled to retire a couple of hours, I went and opened one of the
windows; moved by his perseverance to give him a chance of bestowing on
the faded image of his idol one final adieu.  He did not omit to avail
himself of the opportunity, cautiously and briefly; too cautiously to
betray his presence by the slightest noise.  Indeed, I shouldn't have
discovered that he had been there, except for the disarrangement of the
drapery about the corpse's face, and for observing on the floor a curl of
light hair, fastened with a silver thread; which, on examination, I
ascertained to have been taken from a locket hung round Catherine's neck.
Heathcliff had opened the trinket and cast out its contents, replacing
them by a black lock of his own.  I twisted the two, and enclosed them
together.

Mr. Earnshaw was, of course, invited to attend the remains of his sister
to the grave; he sent no excuse, but he never came; so that, besides her
husband, the mourners were wholly composed of tenants and servants.
Isabella was not asked.

The place of Catherine's interment, to the surprise of the villagers, was
neither in the chapel under the carved monument of the Lintons, nor yet
by the tombs of her own relations, outside.  It was dug on a green slope
in a corner of the kirk-yard, where the wall is so low that heath and
bilberry-plants have climbed over it from the moor; and peat-mould almost
buries it.  Her husband lies in the same spot now; and they have each a
simple headstone above, and a plain grey block at their feet, to mark the
graves.




CHAPTER XVII


That Friday made the last of our fine days for a month.  In the evening
the weather broke: the wind shifted from south to north-east, and brought
rain first, and then sleet and snow.  On the morrow one could hardly
imagine that there had been three weeks of summer: the primroses and
crocuses were hidden under wintry drifts; the larks were silent, the
young leaves of the early trees smitten and blackened.  And dreary, and
chill, and dismal, that morrow did creep over!  My master kept his room;
I took possession of the lonely parlour, converting it into a nursery:
and there I was, sitting with the moaning doll of a child laid on my
knee; rocking it to and fro, and watching, meanwhile, the still driving
flakes build up the uncurtained window, when the door opened, and some
person entered, out of breath and laughing!  My anger was greater than my
astonishment for a minute.  I supposed it one of the maids, and I
cried--'Have done!  How dare you show your giddiness here; What would Mr.
Linton say if he heard you?'

'Excuse me!' answered a familiar voice; 'but I know Edgar is in bed, and
I cannot stop myself.'

With that the speaker came forward to the fire, panting and holding her
hand to her side.

'I have run the whole way from Wuthering Heights!' she continued, after a
pause; 'except where I've flown.  I couldn't count the number of falls
I've had.  Oh, I'm aching all over!  Don't be alarmed!  There shall be an
explanation as soon as I can give it; only just have the goodness to step
out and order the carriage to take me on to Gimmerton, and tell a servant
to seek up a few clothes in my wardrobe.'

The intruder was Mrs. Heathcliff.  She certainly seemed in no laughing
predicament: her hair streamed on her shoulders, dripping with snow and
water; she was dressed in the girlish dress she commonly wore, befitting
her age more than her position: a low frock with short sleeves, and
nothing on either head or neck.  The frock was of light silk, and clung
to her with wet, and her feet were protected merely by thin slippers; add
to this a deep cut under one ear, which only the cold prevented from
bleeding profusely, a white face scratched and bruised, and a frame
hardly able to support itself through fatigue; and you may fancy my first
fright was not much allayed when I had had leisure to examine her.

'My dear young lady,' I exclaimed, 'I'll stir nowhere, and hear nothing,
till you have removed every article of your clothes, and put on dry
things; and certainly you shall not go to Gimmerton to-night, so it is
needless to order the carriage.'

'Certainly I shall,' she said; 'walking or riding: yet I've no objection
to dress myself decently.  And--ah, see how it flows down my neck now!
The fire does make it smart.'

She insisted on my fulfilling her directions, before she would let me
touch her; and not till after the coachman had been instructed to get
ready, and a maid set to pack up some necessary attire, did I obtain her
consent for binding the wound and helping to change her garments.

'Now, Ellen,' she said, when my task was finished and she was seated in
an easy-chair on the hearth, with a cup of tea before her, 'you sit down
opposite me, and put poor Catherine's baby away: I don't like to see it!
You mustn't think I care little for Catherine, because I behaved so
foolishly on entering: I've cried, too, bitterly--yes, more than any one
else has reason to cry.  We parted unreconciled, you remember, and I
sha'n't forgive myself.  But, for all that, I was not going to sympathise
with him--the brute beast!  Oh, give me the poker!  This is the last
thing of his I have about me:' she slipped the gold ring from her third
finger, and threw it on the floor.  'I'll smash it!' she continued,
striking it with childish spite, 'and then I'll burn it!' and she took
and dropped the misused article among the coals.  'There! he shall buy
another, if he gets me back again.  He'd be capable of coming to seek me,
to tease Edgar.  I dare not stay, lest that notion should possess his
wicked head!  And besides, Edgar has not been kind, has he?  And I won't
come suing for his assistance; nor will I bring him into more trouble.
Necessity compelled me to seek shelter here; though, if I had not learned
he was out of the way, I'd have halted at the kitchen, washed my face,
warmed myself, got you to bring what I wanted, and departed again to
anywhere out of the reach of my accursed--of that incarnate goblin!  Ah,
he was in such a fury!  If he had caught me!  It's a pity Earnshaw is not
his match in strength: I wouldn't have run till I'd seen him all but
demolished, had Hindley been able to do it!'

'Well, don't talk so fast, Miss!' I interrupted; 'you'll disorder the
handkerchief I have tied round your face, and make the cut bleed again.
Drink your tea, and take breath, and give over laughing: laughter is
sadly out of place under this roof, and in your condition!'

'An undeniable truth,' she replied.  'Listen to that child!  It maintains
a constant wail--send it out of my hearing for an hour; I sha'n't stay
any longer.'

I rang the bell, and committed it to a servant's care; and then I
inquired what had urged her to escape from Wuthering Heights in such an
unlikely plight, and where she meant to go, as she refused remaining with
us.

'I ought, and I wished to remain,' answered she, 'to cheer Edgar and take
care of the baby, for two things, and because the Grange is my right
home.  But I tell you he wouldn't let me!  Do you think he could bear to
see me grow fat and merry--could bear to think that we were tranquil, and
not resolve on poisoning our comfort?  Now, I have the satisfaction of
being sure that he detests me, to the point of its annoying him seriously
to have me within ear-shot or eyesight: I notice, when I enter his
presence, the muscles of his countenance are involuntarily distorted into
an expression of hatred; partly arising from his knowledge of the good
causes I have to feel that sentiment for him, and partly from original
aversion.  It is strong enough to make me feel pretty certain that he
would not chase me over England, supposing I contrived a clear escape;
and therefore I must get quite away.  I've recovered from my first desire
to be killed by him: I'd rather he'd kill himself!  He has extinguished
my love effectually, and so I'm at my ease.  I can recollect yet how I
loved him; and can dimly imagine that I could still be loving him, if--no,
no!  Even if he had doted on me, the devilish nature would have revealed
its existence somehow.  Catherine had an awfully perverted taste to
esteem him so dearly, knowing him so well.  Monster! would that he could
be blotted out of creation, and out of my memory!'

'Hush, hush!  He's a human being,' I said.  'Be more charitable: there
are worse men than he is yet!'

'He's not a human being,' she retorted; 'and he has no claim on my
charity.  I gave him my heart, and he took and pinched it to death, and
flung it back to me.  People feel with their hearts, Ellen: and since he
has destroyed mine, I have not power to feel for him: and I would not,
though he groaned from this to his dying day, and wept tears of blood for
Catherine!  No, indeed, indeed, I wouldn't!'  And here Isabella began to
cry; but, immediately dashing the water from her lashes, she recommenced.
'You asked, what has driven me to flight at last?  I was compelled to
attempt it, because I had succeeded in rousing his rage a pitch above his
malignity.  Pulling out the nerves with red hot pincers requires more
coolness than knocking on the head.  He was worked up to forget the
fiendish prudence he boasted of, and proceeded to murderous violence.  I
experienced pleasure in being able to exasperate him: the sense of
pleasure woke my instinct of self-preservation, so I fairly broke free;
and if ever I come into his hands again he is welcome to a signal
revenge.

'Yesterday, you know, Mr. Earnshaw should have been at the funeral.  He
kept himself sober for the purpose--tolerably sober: not going to bed mad
at six o'clock and getting up drunk at twelve.  Consequently, he rose, in
suicidal low spirits, as fit for the church as for a dance; and instead,
he sat down by the fire and swallowed gin or brandy by tumblerfuls.

'Heathcliff--I shudder to name him! has been a stranger in the house from
last Sunday till to-day.  Whether the angels have fed him, or his kin
beneath, I cannot tell; but he has not eaten a meal with us for nearly a
week.  He has just come home at dawn, and gone up-stairs to his chamber;
locking himself in--as if anybody dreamt of coveting his company!  There
he has continued, praying like a Methodist: only the deity he implored is
senseless dust and ashes; and God, when addressed, was curiously
confounded with his own black father!  After concluding these precious
orisons--and they lasted generally till he grew hoarse and his voice was
strangled in his throat--he would be off again; always straight down to
the Grange!  I wonder Edgar did not send for a constable, and give him
into custody!  For me, grieved as I was about Catherine, it was
impossible to avoid regarding this season of deliverance from degrading
oppression as a holiday.

'I recovered spirits sufficient to bear Joseph's eternal lectures without
weeping, and to move up and down the house less with the foot of a
frightened thief than formerly.  You wouldn't think that I should cry at
anything Joseph could say; but he and Hareton are detestable companions.
I'd rather sit with Hindley, and hear his awful talk, than with "t'
little maister" and his staunch supporter, that odious old man!  When
Heathcliff is in, I'm often obliged to seek the kitchen and their
society, or starve among the damp uninhabited chambers; when he is not,
as was the case this week, I establish a table and chair at one corner of
the house fire, and never mind how Mr. Earnshaw may occupy himself; and
he does not interfere with my arrangements.  He is quieter now than he
used to be, if no one provokes him: more sullen and depressed, and less
furious.  Joseph affirms he's sure he's an altered man: that the Lord has
touched his heart, and he is saved "so as by fire."  I'm puzzled to
detect signs of the favourable change: but it is not my business.

'Yester-evening I sat in my nook reading some old books till late on
towards twelve.  It seemed so dismal to go up-stairs, with the wild snow
blowing outside, and my thoughts continually reverting to the kirk-yard
and the new-made grave!  I dared hardly lift my eyes from the page before
me, that melancholy scene so instantly usurped its place.  Hindley sat
opposite, his head leant on his hand; perhaps meditating on the same
subject.  He had ceased drinking at a point below irrationality, and had
neither stirred nor spoken during two or three hours.  There was no sound
through the house but the moaning wind, which shook the windows every now
and then, the faint crackling of the coals, and the click of my snuffers
as I removed at intervals the long wick of the candle.  Hareton and
Joseph were probably fast asleep in bed.  It was very, very sad: and
while I read I sighed, for it seemed as if all joy had vanished from the
world, never to be restored.

'The doleful silence was broken at length by the sound of the kitchen
latch: Heathcliff had returned from his watch earlier than usual; owing,
I suppose, to the sudden storm.  That entrance was fastened, and we heard
him coming round to get in by the other.  I rose with an irrepressible
expression of what I felt on my lips, which induced my companion, who had
been staring towards the door, to turn and look at me.

'"I'll keep him out five minutes," he exclaimed.  "You won't object?"

'"No, you may keep him out the whole night for me," I answered.  "Do! put
the key in the lock, and draw the bolts."

'Earnshaw accomplished this ere his guest reached the front; he then came
and brought his chair to the other side of my table, leaning over it, and
searching in my eyes for a sympathy with the burning hate that gleamed
from his: as he both looked and felt like an assassin, he couldn't
exactly find that; but he discovered enough to encourage him to speak.

'"You, and I," he said, "have each a great debt to settle with the man
out yonder!  If we were neither of us cowards, we might combine to
discharge it.  Are you as soft as your brother?  Are you willing to
endure to the last, and not once attempt a repayment?"

'"I'm weary of enduring now," I replied; "and I'd be glad of a
retaliation that wouldn't recoil on myself; but treachery and violence
are spears pointed at both ends; they wound those who resort to them
worse than their enemies."

'"Treachery and violence are a just return for treachery and violence!"
cried Hindley.  "Mrs. Heathcliff, I'll ask you to do nothing; but sit
still and be dumb.  Tell me now, can you?  I'm sure you would have as
much pleasure as I in witnessing the conclusion of the fiend's existence;
he'll be _your_ death unless you overreach him; and he'll be _my_ ruin.
Damn the hellish villain!  He knocks at the door as if he were master
here already!  Promise to hold your tongue, and before that clock
strikes--it wants three minutes of one--you're a free woman!"

'He took the implements which I described to you in my letter from his
breast, and would have turned down the candle.  I snatched it away,
however, and seized his arm.

'"I'll not hold my tongue!" I said; "you mustn't touch him.  Let the door
remain shut, and be quiet!"

'"No!  I've formed my resolution, and by God I'll execute it!" cried the
desperate being.  "I'll do you a kindness in spite of yourself, and
Hareton justice!  And you needn't trouble your head to screen me;
Catherine is gone.  Nobody alive would regret me, or be ashamed, though I
cut my throat this minute--and it's time to make an end!"

'I might as well have struggled with a bear, or reasoned with a lunatic.
The only resource left me was to run to a lattice and warn his intended
victim of the fate which awaited him.

'"You'd better seek shelter somewhere else to-night!" I exclaimed, in
rather a triumphant tone.  "Mr. Earnshaw has a mind to shoot you, if you
persist in endeavouring to enter."

'"You'd better open the door, you--" he answered, addressing me by some
elegant term that I don't care to repeat.

'"I shall not meddle in the matter," I retorted again.  "Come in and get
shot, if you please.  I've done my duty."

'With that I shut the window and returned to my place by the fire; having
too small a stock of hypocrisy at my command to pretend any anxiety for
the danger that menaced him.  Earnshaw swore passionately at me:
affirming that I loved the villain yet; and calling me all sorts of names
for the base spirit I evinced.  And I, in my secret heart (and conscience
never reproached me), thought what a blessing it would be for _him_
should Heathcliff put him out of misery; and what a blessing for _me_
should he send Heathcliff to his right abode!  As I sat nursing these
reflections, the casement behind me was banged on to the floor by a blow
from the latter individual, and his black countenance looked blightingly
through.  The stanchions stood too close to suffer his shoulders to
follow, and I smiled, exulting in my fancied security.  His hair and
clothes were whitened with snow, and his sharp cannibal teeth, revealed
by cold and wrath, gleamed through the dark.

'"Isabella, let me in, or I'll make you repent!" he "girned," as Joseph
calls it.

'"I cannot commit murder," I replied.  "Mr. Hindley stands sentinel with
a knife and loaded pistol."

'"Let me in by the kitchen door," he said.

'"Hindley will be there before me," I answered: "and that's a poor love
of yours that cannot bear a shower of snow!  We were left at peace in our
beds as long as the summer moon shone, but the moment a blast of winter
returns, you must run for shelter!  Heathcliff, if I were you, I'd go
stretch myself over her grave and die like a faithful dog.  The world is
surely not worth living in now, is it?  You had distinctly impressed on
me the idea that Catherine was the whole joy of your life: I can't
imagine how you think of surviving her loss."

'"He's there, is he?" exclaimed my companion, rushing to the gap.  "If I
can get my arm out I can hit him!"

'I'm afraid, Ellen, you'll set me down as really wicked; but you don't
know all, so don't judge.  I wouldn't have aided or abetted an attempt on
even _his_ life for anything.  Wish that he were dead, I must; and
therefore I was fearfully disappointed, and unnerved by terror for the
consequences of my taunting speech, when he flung himself on Earnshaw's
weapon and wrenched it from his grasp.

'The charge exploded, and the knife, in springing back, closed into its
owner's wrist.  Heathcliff pulled it away by main force, slitting up the
flesh as it passed on, and thrust it dripping into his pocket.  He then
took a stone, struck down the division between two windows, and sprang
in.  His adversary had fallen senseless with excessive pain and the flow
of blood, that gushed from an artery or a large vein.  The ruffian kicked
and trampled on him, and dashed his head repeatedly against the flags,
holding me with one hand, meantime, to prevent me summoning Joseph.  He
exerted preterhuman self-denial in abstaining from finishing him
completely; but getting out of breath, he finally desisted, and dragged
the apparently inanimate body on to the settle.  There he tore off the
sleeve of Earnshaw's coat, and bound up the wound with brutal roughness;
spitting and cursing during the operation as energetically as he had
kicked before.  Being at liberty, I lost no time in seeking the old
servant; who, having gathered by degrees the purport of my hasty tale,
hurried below, gasping, as he descended the steps two at once.

'"What is ther to do, now? what is ther to do, now?"

'"There's this to do," thundered Heathcliff, "that your master's mad; and
should he last another month, I'll have him to an asylum.  And how the
devil did you come to fasten me out, you toothless hound?  Don't stand
muttering and mumbling there.  Come, I'm not going to nurse him.  Wash
that stuff away; and mind the sparks of your candle--it is more than half
brandy!"

'"And so ye've been murthering on him?" exclaimed Joseph, lifting his
hands and eyes in horror.  "If iver I seed a seeght loike this!  May the
Lord--"

'Heathcliff gave him a push on to his knees in the middle of the blood,
and flung a towel to him; but instead of proceeding to dry it up, he
joined his hands and began a prayer, which excited my laughter from its
odd phraseology.  I was in the condition of mind to be shocked at
nothing: in fact, I was as reckless as some malefactors show themselves
at the foot of the gallows.

'"Oh, I forgot you," said the tyrant.  "You shall do that.  Down with
you.  And you conspire with him against me, do you, viper?  There, that
is work fit for you!"

'He shook me till my teeth rattled, and pitched me beside Joseph, who
steadily concluded his supplications, and then rose, vowing he would set
off for the Grange directly.  Mr. Linton was a magistrate, and though he
had fifty wives dead, he should inquire into this.  He was so obstinate
in his resolution, that Heathcliff deemed it expedient to compel from my
lips a recapitulation of what had taken place; standing over me, heaving
with malevolence, as I reluctantly delivered the account in answer to his
questions.  It required a great deal of labour to satisfy the old man
that Heathcliff was not the aggressor; especially with my hardly-wrung
replies.  However, Mr. Earnshaw soon convinced him that he was alive
still; Joseph hastened to administer a dose of spirits, and by their
succour his master presently regained motion and consciousness.
Heathcliff, aware that his opponent was ignorant of the treatment
received while insensible, called him deliriously intoxicated; and said
he should not notice his atrocious conduct further, but advised him to
get to bed.  To my joy, he left us, after giving this judicious counsel,
and Hindley stretched himself on the hearthstone.  I departed to my own
room, marvelling that I had escaped so easily.

'This morning, when I came down, about half an hour before noon, Mr.
Earnshaw was sitting by the fire, deadly sick; his evil genius, almost as
gaunt and ghastly, leant against the chimney.  Neither appeared inclined
to dine, and, having waited till all was cold on the table, I commenced
alone.  Nothing hindered me from eating heartily, and I experienced a
certain sense of satisfaction and superiority, as, at intervals, I cast a
look towards my silent companions, and felt the comfort of a quiet
conscience within me.  After I had done, I ventured on the unusual
liberty of drawing near the fire, going round Earnshaw's seat, and
kneeling in the corner beside him.

'Heathcliff did not glance my way, and I gazed up, and contemplated his
features almost as confidently as if they had been turned to stone.  His
forehead, that I once thought so manly, and that I now think so
diabolical, was shaded with a heavy cloud; his basilisk eyes were nearly
quenched by sleeplessness, and weeping, perhaps, for the lashes were wet
then: his lips devoid of their ferocious sneer, and sealed in an
expression of unspeakable sadness.  Had it been another, I would have
covered my face in the presence of such grief.  In _his_ case, I was
gratified; and, ignoble as it seems to insult a fallen enemy, I couldn't
miss this chance of sticking in a dart: his weakness was the only time
when I could taste the delight of paying wrong for wrong.'

'Fie, fie, Miss!' I interrupted.  'One might suppose you had never opened
a Bible in your life.  If God afflict your enemies, surely that ought to
suffice you.  It is both mean and presumptuous to add your torture to
his!'

'In general I'll allow that it would be, Ellen,' she continued; 'but what
misery laid on Heathcliff could content me, unless I have a hand in it?
I'd rather he suffered less, if I might cause his sufferings and he might
_know_ that I was the cause.  Oh, I owe him so much.  On only one
condition can I hope to forgive him.  It is, if I may take an eye for an
eye, a tooth for a tooth; for every wrench of agony return a wrench:
reduce him to my level.  As he was the first to injure, make him the
first to implore pardon; and then--why then, Ellen, I might show you some
generosity.  But it is utterly impossible I can ever be revenged, and
therefore I cannot forgive him.  Hindley wanted some water, and I handed
him a glass, and asked him how he was.

'"Not as ill as I wish," he replied.  "But leaving out my arm, every inch
of me is as sore as if I had been fighting with a legion of imps!"

'"Yes, no wonder," was my next remark.  "Catherine used to boast that she
stood between you and bodily harm: she meant that certain persons would
not hurt you for fear of offending her.  It's well people don't _really_
rise from their grave, or, last night, she might have witnessed a
repulsive scene!  Are not you bruised, and cut over your chest and
shoulders?"

'"I can't say," he answered, "but what do you mean?  Did he dare to
strike me when I was down?"

'"He trampled on and kicked you, and dashed you on the ground," I
whispered.  "And his mouth watered to tear you with his teeth; because
he's only half man: not so much, and the rest fiend."

'Mr. Earnshaw looked up, like me, to the countenance of our mutual foe;
who, absorbed in his anguish, seemed insensible to anything around him:
the longer he stood, the plainer his reflections revealed their blackness
through his features.

'"Oh, if God would but give me strength to strangle him in my last agony,
I'd go to hell with joy," groaned the impatient man, writhing to rise,
and sinking back in despair, convinced of his inadequacy for the
struggle.

'"Nay, it's enough that he has murdered one of you," I observed aloud.
"At the Grange, every one knows your sister would have been living now
had it not been for Mr. Heathcliff.  After all, it is preferable to be
hated than loved by him.  When I recollect how happy we were--how happy
Catherine was before he came--I'm fit to curse the day."

'Most likely, Heathcliff noticed more the truth of what was said, than
the spirit of the person who said it.  His attention was roused, I saw,
for his eyes rained down tears among the ashes, and he drew his breath in
suffocating sighs.  I stared full at him, and laughed scornfully.  The
clouded windows of hell flashed a moment towards me; the fiend which
usually looked out, however, was so dimmed and drowned that I did not
fear to hazard another sound of derision.

'"Get up, and begone out of my sight," said the mourner.

'I guessed he uttered those words, at least, though his voice was hardly
intelligible.

'"I beg your pardon," I replied.  "But I loved Catherine too; and her
brother requires attendance, which, for her sake, I shall supply.  Now,
that she's dead, I see her in Hindley: Hindley has exactly her eyes, if
you had not tried to gouge them out, and made them black and red; and
her--"

'"Get up, wretched idiot, before I stamp you to death!" he cried, making
a movement that caused me to make one also.

'"But then," I continued, holding myself ready to flee, "if poor
Catherine had trusted you, and assumed the ridiculous, contemptible,
degrading title of Mrs. Heathcliff, she would soon have presented a
similar picture!  _She_ wouldn't have borne your abominable behaviour
quietly: her detestation and disgust must have found voice."

'The back of the settle and Earnshaw's person interposed between me and
him; so instead of endeavouring to reach me, he snatched a dinner-knife
from the table and flung it at my head.  It struck beneath my ear, and
stopped the sentence I was uttering; but, pulling it out, I sprang to the
door and delivered another; which I hope went a little deeper than his
missile.  The last glimpse I caught of him was a furious rush on his
part, checked by the embrace of his host; and both fell locked together
on the hearth.  In my flight through the kitchen I bid Joseph speed to
his master; I knocked over Hareton, who was hanging a litter of puppies
from a chair-back in the doorway; and, blessed as a soul escaped from
purgatory, I bounded, leaped, and flew down the steep road; then,
quitting its windings, shot direct across the moor, rolling over banks,
and wading through marshes: precipitating myself, in fact, towards the
beacon-light of the Grange.  And far rather would I be condemned to a
perpetual dwelling in the infernal regions than, even for one night,
abide beneath the roof of Wuthering Heights again.'

Isabella ceased speaking, and took a drink of tea; then she rose, and
bidding me put on her bonnet, and a great shawl I had brought, and
turning a deaf ear to my entreaties for her to remain another hour, she
stepped on to a chair, kissed Edgar's and Catherine's portraits, bestowed
a similar salute on me, and descended to the carriage, accompanied by
Fanny, who yelped wild with joy at recovering her mistress.  She was
driven away, never to revisit this neighbourhood: but a regular
correspondence was established between her and my master when things were
more settled.  I believe her new abode was in the south, near London;
there she had a son born a few months subsequent to her escape.  He was
christened Linton, and, from the first, she reported him to be an ailing,
peevish creature.

Mr. Heathcliff, meeting me one day in the village, inquired where she
lived.  I refused to tell.  He remarked that it was not of any moment,
only she must beware of coming to her brother: she should not be with
him, if he had to keep her himself.  Though I would give no information,
he discovered, through some of the other servants, both her place of
residence and the existence of the child.  Still, he didn't molest her:
for which forbearance she might thank his aversion, I suppose.  He often
asked about the infant, when he saw me; and on hearing its name, smiled
grimly, and observed: 'They wish me to hate it too, do they?'

'I don't think they wish you to know anything about it,' I answered.

'But I'll have it,' he said, 'when I want it.  They may reckon on that!'

Fortunately its mother died before the time arrived; some thirteen years
after the decease of Catherine, when Linton was twelve, or a little more.

On the day succeeding Isabella's unexpected visit I had no opportunity of
speaking to my master: he shunned conversation, and was fit for
discussing nothing.  When I could get him to listen, I saw it pleased him
that his sister had left her husband; whom he abhorred with an intensity
which the mildness of his nature would scarcely seem to allow.  So deep
and sensitive was his aversion, that he refrained from going anywhere
where he was likely to see or hear of Heathcliff.  Grief, and that
together, transformed him into a complete hermit: he threw up his office
of magistrate, ceased even to attend church, avoided the village on all
occasions, and spent a life of entire seclusion within the limits of his
park and grounds; only varied by solitary rambles on the moors, and
visits to the grave of his wife, mostly at evening, or early morning
before other wanderers were abroad.  But he was too good to be thoroughly
unhappy long.  _He_ didn't pray for Catherine's soul to haunt him.  Time
brought resignation, and a melancholy sweeter than common joy.  He
recalled her memory with ardent, tender love, and hopeful aspiring to the
better world; where he doubted not she was gone.

And he had earthly consolation and affections also.  For a few days, I
said, he seemed regardless of the puny successor to the departed: that
coldness melted as fast as snow in April, and ere the tiny thing could
stammer a word or totter a step it wielded a despot's sceptre in his
heart.  It was named Catherine; but he never called it the name in full,
as he had never called the first Catherine short: probably because
Heathcliff had a habit of doing so.  The little one was always Cathy: it
formed to him a distinction from the mother, and yet a connection with
her; and his attachment sprang from its relation to her, far more than
from its being his own.

I used to draw a comparison between him and Hindley Earnshaw, and perplex
myself to explain satisfactorily why their conduct was so opposite in
similar circumstances.  They had both been fond husbands, and were both
attached to their children; and I could not see how they shouldn't both
have taken the same road, for good or evil.  But, I thought in my mind,
Hindley, with apparently the stronger head, has shown himself sadly the
worse and the weaker man.  When his ship struck, the captain abandoned
his post; and the crew, instead of trying to save her, rushed into riot
and confusion, leaving no hope for their luckless vessel.  Linton, on the
contrary, displayed the true courage of a loyal and faithful soul: he
trusted God; and God comforted him.  One hoped, and the other despaired:
they chose their own lots, and were righteously doomed to endure them.
But you'll not want to hear my moralising, Mr. Lockwood; you'll judge, as
well as I can, all these things: at least, you'll think you will, and
that's the same.  The end of Earnshaw was what might have been expected;
it followed fast on his sister's: there were scarcely six months between
them.  We, at the Grange, never got a very succinct account of his state
preceding it; all that I did learn was on occasion of going to aid in the
preparations for the funeral.  Mr. Kenneth came to announce the event to
my master.

'Well, Nelly,' said he, riding into the yard one morning, too early not
to alarm me with an instant presentiment of bad news, 'it's yours and my
turn to go into mourning at present.  Who's given us the slip now, do you
think?'

'Who?' I asked in a flurry.

'Why, guess!' he returned, dismounting, and slinging his bridle on a hook
by the door.  'And nip up the corner of your apron: I'm certain you'll
need it.'

'Not Mr. Heathcliff, surely?' I exclaimed.

'What! would you have tears for him?' said the doctor.  'No, Heathcliff's
a tough young fellow: he looks blooming to-day.  I've just seen him.  He's
rapidly regaining flesh since he lost his better half.'

'Who is it, then, Mr. Kenneth?' I repeated impatiently.

'Hindley Earnshaw!  Your old friend Hindley,' he replied, 'and my wicked
gossip: though he's been too wild for me this long while.  There!  I said
we should draw water.  But cheer up!  He died true to his character:
drunk as a lord.  Poor lad!  I'm sorry, too.  One can't help missing an
old companion: though he had the worst tricks with him that ever man
imagined, and has done me many a rascally turn.  He's barely
twenty-seven, it seems; that's your own age: who would have thought you
were born in one year?'

I confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of Mrs. Linton's
death: ancient associations lingered round my heart; I sat down in the
porch and wept as for a blood relation, desiring Mr. Kenneth to get
another servant to introduce him to the master.  I could not hinder
myself from pondering on the question--'Had he had fair play?'  Whatever
I did, that idea would bother me: it was so tiresomely pertinacious that
I resolved on requesting leave to go to Wuthering Heights, and assist in
the last duties to the dead.  Mr. Linton was extremely reluctant to
consent, but I pleaded eloquently for the friendless condition in which
he lay; and I said my old master and foster-brother had a claim on my
services as strong as his own.  Besides, I reminded him that the child
Hareton was his wife's nephew, and, in the absence of nearer kin, he
ought to act as its guardian; and he ought to and must inquire how the
property was left, and look over the concerns of his brother-in-law.  He
was unfit for attending to such matters then, but he bid me speak to his
lawyer; and at length permitted me to go.  His lawyer had been Earnshaw's
also: I called at the village, and asked him to accompany me.  He shook
his head, and advised that Heathcliff should be let alone; affirming, if
the truth were known, Hareton would be found little else than a beggar.

'His father died in debt,' he said; 'the whole property is mortgaged, and
the sole chance for the natural heir is to allow him an opportunity of
creating some interest in the creditor's heart, that he may be inclined
to deal leniently towards him.'

When I reached the Heights, I explained that I had come to see everything
carried on decently; and Joseph, who appeared in sufficient distress,
expressed satisfaction at my presence.  Mr. Heathcliff said he did not
perceive that I was wanted; but I might stay and order the arrangements
for the funeral, if I chose.

'Correctly,' he remarked, 'that fool's body should be buried at the
cross-roads, without ceremony of any kind. I happened to leave him ten
minutes yesterday afternoon, and in that interval he fastened the two
doors of the house against me, and he has spent the night in drinking
himself to death deliberately! We broke in this morning, for we heard
him sporting like a horse; and there he was, laid over the settle:
flaying and scalping would not have wakened him. I sent for Kenneth, and
he came; but not till the beast had changed into carrion: he was both
dead and cold, and stark; and so you'll allow it was useless making more
stir about him!'

The old servant confirmed this statement, but muttered:

'I'd rayther he'd goan hisseln for t' doctor!  I sud ha' taen tent o' t'
maister better nor him--and he warn't deead when I left, naught o' t'
soart!'

I insisted on the funeral being respectable.  Mr. Heathcliff said I might
have my own way there too: only, he desired me to remember that the money
for the whole affair came out of his pocket.  He maintained a hard,
careless deportment, indicative of neither joy nor sorrow: if anything,
it expressed a flinty gratification at a piece of difficult work
successfully executed.  I observed once, indeed, something like
exultation in his aspect: it was just when the people were bearing the
coffin from the house.  He had the hypocrisy to represent a mourner: and
previous to following with Hareton, he lifted the unfortunate child on to
the table and muttered, with peculiar gusto, 'Now, my bonny lad, you are
_mine_!  And we'll see if one tree won't grow as crooked as another, with
the same wind to twist it!'  The unsuspecting thing was pleased at this
speech: he played with Heathcliff's whiskers, and stroked his cheek; but
I divined its meaning, and observed tartly, 'That boy must go back with
me to Thrushcross Grange, sir.  There is nothing in the world less yours
than he is!'

'Does Linton say so?' he demanded.

'Of course--he has ordered me to take him,' I replied.

'Well,' said the scoundrel, 'we'll not argue the subject now: but I have
a fancy to try my hand at rearing a young one; so intimate to your master
that I must supply the place of this with my own, if he attempt to remove
it.  I don't engage to let Hareton go undisputed; but I'll be pretty sure
to make the other come!  Remember to tell him.'

This hint was enough to bind our hands.  I repeated its substance on my
return; and Edgar Linton, little interested at the commencement, spoke no
more of interfering.  I'm not aware that he could have done it to any
purpose, had he been ever so willing.

The guest was now the master of Wuthering Heights: he held firm
possession, and proved to the attorney--who, in his turn, proved it to
Mr. Linton--that Earnshaw had mortgaged every yard of land he owned for
cash to supply his mania for gaming; and he, Heathcliff, was the
mortgagee.  In that manner Hareton, who should now be the first gentleman
in the neighbourhood, was reduced to a state of complete dependence on
his father's inveterate enemy; and lives in his own house as a servant,
deprived of the advantage of wages: quite unable to right himself,
because of his friendlessness, and his ignorance that he has been
wronged.




CHAPTER XVIII


The twelve years, continued Mrs. Dean, following that dismal period were
the happiest of my life: my greatest troubles in their passage rose from
our little lady's trifling illnesses, which she had to experience in
common with all children, rich and poor.  For the rest, after the first
six months, she grew like a larch, and could walk and talk too, in her
own way, before the heath blossomed a second time over Mrs. Linton's
dust.  She was the most winning thing that ever brought sunshine into a
desolate house: a real beauty in face, with the Earnshaws' handsome dark
eyes, but the Lintons' fair skin and small features, and yellow curling
hair.  Her spirit was high, though not rough, and qualified by a heart
sensitive and lively to excess in its affections.  That capacity for
intense attachments reminded me of her mother: still she did not resemble
her: for she could be soft and mild as a dove, and she had a gentle voice
and pensive expression: her anger was never furious; her love never
fierce: it was deep and tender.  However, it must be acknowledged, she
had faults to foil her gifts.  A propensity to be saucy was one; and a
perverse will, that indulged children invariably acquire, whether they be
good tempered or cross.  If a servant chanced to vex her, it was
always--'I shall tell papa!'  And if he reproved her, even by a look, you
would have thought it a heart-breaking business: I don't believe he ever
did speak a harsh word to her.  He took her education entirely on
himself, and made it an amusement.  Fortunately, curiosity and a quick
intellect made her an apt scholar: she learned rapidly and eagerly, and
did honour to his teaching.

Till she reached the age of thirteen she had not once been beyond the
range of the park by herself.  Mr. Linton would take her with him a mile
or so outside, on rare occasions; but he trusted her to no one else.
Gimmerton was an unsubstantial name in her ears; the chapel, the only
building she had approached or entered, except her own home.  Wuthering
Heights and Mr. Heathcliff did not exist for her: she was a perfect
recluse; and, apparently, perfectly contented.  Sometimes, indeed, while
surveying the country from her nursery window, she would observe--

'Ellen, how long will it be before I can walk to the top of those hills?
I wonder what lies on the other side--is it the sea?'

'No, Miss Cathy,' I would answer; 'it is hills again, just like these.'

'And what are those golden rocks like when you stand under them?' she
once asked.

The abrupt descent of Penistone Crags particularly attracted her notice;
especially when the setting sun shone on it and the topmost heights, and
the whole extent of landscape besides lay in shadow.  I explained that
they were bare masses of stone, with hardly enough earth in their clefts
to nourish a stunted tree.

'And why are they bright so long after it is evening here?' she pursued.

'Because they are a great deal higher up than we are,' replied I; 'you
could not climb them, they are too high and steep.  In winter the frost
is always there before it comes to us; and deep into summer I have found
snow under that black hollow on the north-east side!'

'Oh, you have been on them!' she cried gleefully.  'Then I can go, too,
when I am a woman.  Has papa been, Ellen?'

'Papa would tell you, Miss,' I answered, hastily, 'that they are not
worth the trouble of visiting.  The moors, where you ramble with him, are
much nicer; and Thrushcross Park is the finest place in the world.'

'But I know the park, and I don't know those,' she murmured to herself.
'And I should delight to look round me from the brow of that tallest
point: my little pony Minny shall take me some time.'

One of the maids mentioning the Fairy Cave, quite turned her head with a
desire to fulfil this project: she teased Mr. Linton about it; and he
promised she should have the journey when she got older.  But Miss
Catherine measured her age by months, and, 'Now, am I old enough to go to
Penistone Crags?' was the constant question in her mouth.  The road
thither wound close by Wuthering Heights.  Edgar had not the heart to
pass it; so she received as constantly the answer, 'Not yet, love: not
yet.'

I said Mrs. Heathcliff lived above a dozen years after quitting her
husband.  Her family were of a delicate constitution: she and Edgar both
lacked the ruddy health that you will generally meet in these parts.  What
her last illness was, I am not certain: I conjecture, they died of the
same thing, a kind of fever, slow at its commencement, but incurable, and
rapidly consuming life towards the close.  She wrote to inform her
brother of the probable conclusion of a four-months' indisposition under
which she had suffered, and entreated him to come to her, if possible;
for she had much to settle, and she wished to bid him adieu, and deliver
Linton safely into his hands.  Her hope was that Linton might be left
with him, as he had been with her: his father, she would fain convince
herself, had no desire to assume the burden of his maintenance or
education.  My master hesitated not a moment in complying with her
request: reluctant as he was to leave home at ordinary calls, he flew to
answer this; commanding Catherine to my peculiar vigilance, in his
absence, with reiterated orders that she must not wander out of the park,
even under my escort he did not calculate on her going unaccompanied.

He was away three weeks.  The first day or two my charge sat in a corner
of the library, too sad for either reading or playing: in that quiet
state she caused me little trouble; but it was succeeded by an interval
of impatient, fretful weariness; and being too busy, and too old then, to
run up and down amusing her, I hit on a method by which she might
entertain herself.  I used to send her on her travels round the
grounds--now on foot, and now on a pony; indulging her with a patient
audience of all her real and imaginary adventures when she returned.

The summer shone in full prime; and she took such a taste for this
solitary rambling that she often contrived to remain out from breakfast
till tea; and then the evenings were spent in recounting her fanciful
tales.  I did not fear her breaking bounds; because the gates were
generally locked, and I thought she would scarcely venture forth alone,
if they had stood wide open.  Unluckily, my confidence proved misplaced.
Catherine came to me, one morning, at eight o'clock, and said she was
that day an Arabian merchant, going to cross the Desert with his caravan;
and I must give her plenty of provision for herself and beasts: a horse,
and three camels, personated by a large hound and a couple of pointers.  I
got together good store of dainties, and slung them in a basket on one
side of the saddle; and she sprang up as gay as a fairy, sheltered by her
wide-brimmed hat and gauze veil from the July sun, and trotted off with a
merry laugh, mocking my cautious counsel to avoid galloping, and come
back early.  The naughty thing never made her appearance at tea.  One
traveller, the hound, being an old dog and fond of its ease, returned;
but neither Cathy, nor the pony, nor the two pointers were visible in any
direction: I despatched emissaries down this path, and that path, and at
last went wandering in search of her myself.  There was a labourer
working at a fence round a plantation, on the borders of the grounds.  I
inquired of him if he had seen our young lady.

'I saw her at morn,' he replied: 'she would have me to cut her a hazel
switch, and then she leapt her Galloway over the hedge yonder, where it
is lowest, and galloped out of sight.'

You may guess how I felt at hearing this news.  It struck me directly she
must have started for Penistone Crags.  'What will become of her?' I
ejaculated, pushing through a gap which the man was repairing, and making
straight to the high-road.  I walked as if for a wager, mile after mile,
till a turn brought me in view of the Heights; but no Catherine could I
detect, far or near.  The Crags lie about a mile and a half beyond Mr.
Heathcliff's place, and that is four from the Grange, so I began to fear
night would fall ere I could reach them.  'And what if she should have
slipped in clambering among them,' I reflected, 'and been killed, or
broken some of her bones?'  My suspense was truly painful; and, at first,
it gave me delightful relief to observe, in hurrying by the farmhouse,
Charlie, the fiercest of the pointers, lying under a window, with swelled
head and bleeding ear.  I opened the wicket and ran to the door, knocking
vehemently for admittance.  A woman whom I knew, and who formerly lived
at Gimmerton, answered: she had been servant there since the death of Mr.
Earnshaw.

'Ah,' said she, 'you are come a-seeking your little mistress!  Don't be
frightened.  She's here safe: but I'm glad it isn't the master.'

'He is not at home then, is he?' I panted, quite breathless with quick
walking and alarm.

'No, no,' she replied: 'both he and Joseph are off, and I think they
won't return this hour or more.  Step in and rest you a bit.'

I entered, and beheld my stray lamb seated on the hearth, rocking herself
in a little chair that had been her mother's when a child.  Her hat was
hung against the wall, and she seemed perfectly at home, laughing and
chattering, in the best spirits imaginable, to Hareton--now a great,
strong lad of eighteen--who stared at her with considerable curiosity and
astonishment: comprehending precious little of the fluent succession of
remarks and questions which her tongue never ceased pouring forth.

'Very well, Miss!' I exclaimed, concealing my joy under an angry
countenance.  'This is your last ride, till papa comes back.  I'll not
trust you over the threshold again, you naughty, naughty girl!'

'Aha, Ellen!' she cried, gaily, jumping up and running to my side.  'I
shall have a pretty story to tell to-night; and so you've found me out.
Have you ever been here in your life before?'

'Put that hat on, and home at once,' said I.  'I'm dreadfully grieved at
you, Miss Cathy: you've done extremely wrong!  It's no use pouting and
crying: that won't repay the trouble I've had, scouring the country after
you.  To think how Mr. Linton charged me to keep you in; and you stealing
off so!  It shows you are a cunning little fox, and nobody will put faith
in you any more.'

'What have I done?' sobbed she, instantly checked.  'Papa charged me
nothing: he'll not scold me, Ellen--he's never cross, like you!'

'Come, come!' I repeated.  'I'll tie the riband.  Now, let us have no
petulance.  Oh, for shame!  You thirteen years old, and such a baby!'

This exclamation was caused by her pushing the hat from her head, and
retreating to the chimney out of my reach.

'Nay,' said the servant, 'don't be hard on the bonny lass, Mrs. Dean.  We
made her stop: she'd fain have ridden forwards, afeard you should be
uneasy.  Hareton offered to go with her, and I thought he should: it's a
wild road over the hills.'

Hareton, during the discussion, stood with his hands in his pockets, too
awkward to speak; though he looked as if he did not relish my intrusion.

'How long am I to wait?' I continued, disregarding the woman's
interference.  'It will be dark in ten minutes.  Where is the pony, Miss
Cathy?  And where is Phoenix?  I shall leave you, unless you be quick; so
please yourself.'

'The pony is in the yard,' she replied, 'and Phoenix is shut in there.
He's bitten--and so is Charlie.  I was going to tell you all about it;
but you are in a bad temper, and don't deserve to hear.'

I picked up her hat, and approached to reinstate it; but perceiving that
the people of the house took her part, she commenced capering round the
room; and on my giving chase, ran like a mouse over and under and behind
the furniture, rendering it ridiculous for me to pursue.  Hareton and the
woman laughed, and she joined them, and waxed more impertinent still;
till I cried, in great irritation,--'Well, Miss Cathy, if you were aware
whose house this is you'd be glad enough to get out.'

'It's _your_ father's, isn't it?' said she, turning to Hareton.

'Nay,' he replied, looking down, and blushing bashfully.

He could not stand a steady gaze from her eyes, though they were just his
own.

'Whose then--your master's?' she asked.

He coloured deeper, with a different feeling, muttered an oath, and
turned away.

'Who is his master?' continued the tiresome girl, appealing to me.  'He
talked about "our house," and "our folk."  I thought he had been the
owner's son.  And he never said Miss: he should have done, shouldn't he,
if he's a servant?'

Hareton grew black as a thunder-cloud at this childish speech.  I
silently shook my questioner, and at last succeeded in equipping her for
departure.

'Now, get my horse,' she said, addressing her unknown kinsman as she
would one of the stable-boys at the Grange.  'And you may come with me.  I
want to see where the goblin-hunter rises in the marsh, and to hear about
the _fairishes_, as you call them: but make haste!  What's the matter?
Get my horse, I say.'

'I'll see thee damned before I be _thy_ servant!' growled the lad.

'You'll see me _what_!' asked Catherine in surprise.

'Damned--thou saucy witch!' he replied.

'There, Miss Cathy! you see you have got into pretty company,' I
interposed.  'Nice words to be used to a young lady!  Pray don't begin to
dispute with him.  Come, let us seek for Minny ourselves, and begone.'

'But, Ellen,' cried she, staring fixed in astonishment, 'how dare he
speak so to me?  Mustn't he be made to do as I ask him?  You wicked
creature, I shall tell papa what you said.--Now, then!'

Hareton did not appear to feel this threat; so the tears sprang into her
eyes with indignation.  'You bring the pony,' she exclaimed, turning to
the woman, 'and let my dog free this moment!'

'Softly, Miss,' answered she addressed; 'you'll lose nothing by being
civil.  Though Mr. Hareton, there, be not the master's son, he's your
cousin: and I was never hired to serve you.'

'_He_ my cousin!' cried Cathy, with a scornful laugh.

'Yes, indeed,' responded her reprover.

'Oh, Ellen! don't let them say such things,' she pursued in great
trouble.  'Papa is gone to fetch my cousin from London: my cousin is a
gentleman's son.  That my--' she stopped, and wept outright; upset at the
bare notion of relationship with such a clown.

'Hush, hush!' I whispered; 'people can have many cousins and of all
sorts, Miss Cathy, without being any the worse for it; only they needn't
keep their company, if they be disagreeable and bad.'

'He's not--he's not my cousin, Ellen!' she went on, gathering fresh grief
from reflection, and flinging herself into my arms for refuge from the
idea.

I was much vexed at her and the servant for their mutual revelations;
having no doubt of Linton's approaching arrival, communicated by the
former, being reported to Mr. Heathcliff; and feeling as confident that
Catherine's first thought on her father's return would be to seek an
explanation of the latter's assertion concerning her rude-bred kindred.
Hareton, recovering from his disgust at being taken for a servant, seemed
moved by her distress; and, having fetched the pony round to the door, he
took, to propitiate her, a fine crooked-legged terrier whelp from the
kennel, and putting it into her hand, bid her whist! for he meant nought.
Pausing in her lamentations, she surveyed him with a glance of awe and
horror, then burst forth anew.

I could scarcely refrain from smiling at this antipathy to the poor
fellow; who was a well-made, athletic youth, good-looking in features,
and stout and healthy, but attired in garments befitting his daily
occupations of working on the farm and lounging among the moors after
rabbits and game.  Still, I thought I could detect in his physiognomy a
mind owning better qualities than his father ever possessed.  Good things
lost amid a wilderness of weeds, to be sure, whose rankness far
over-topped their neglected growth; yet, notwithstanding, evidence of a
wealthy soil, that might yield luxuriant crops under other and favourable
circumstances.  Mr. Heathcliff, I believe, had not treated him physically
ill; thanks to his fearless nature, which offered no temptation to that
course of oppression: he had none of the timid susceptibility that would
have given zest to ill-treatment, in Heathcliff's judgment.  He appeared
to have bent his malevolence on making him a brute: he was never taught
to read or write; never rebuked for any bad habit which did not annoy his
keeper; never led a single step towards virtue, or guarded by a single
precept against vice.  And from what I heard, Joseph contributed much to
his deterioration, by a narrow-minded partiality which prompted him to
flatter and pet him, as a boy, because he was the head of the old family.
And as he had been in the habit of accusing Catherine Earnshaw and
Heathcliff, when children, of putting the master past his patience, and
compelling him to seek solace in drink by what he termed their 'offald
ways,' so at present he laid the whole burden of Hareton's faults on the
shoulders of the usurper of his property.  If the lad swore, he wouldn't
correct him: nor however culpably he behaved.  It gave Joseph
satisfaction, apparently, to watch him go the worst lengths: he allowed
that the lad was ruined: that his soul was abandoned to perdition; but
then he reflected that Heathcliff must answer for it.  Hareton's blood
would be required at his hands; and there lay immense consolation in that
thought.  Joseph had instilled into him a pride of name, and of his
lineage; he would, had he dared, have fostered hate between him and the
present owner of the Heights: but his dread of that owner amounted to
superstition; and he confined his feelings regarding him to muttered
innuendoes and private comminations.  I don't pretend to be intimately
acquainted with the mode of living customary in those days at Wuthering
Heights: I only speak from hearsay; for I saw little.  The villagers
affirmed Mr. Heathcliff was _near_, and a cruel hard landlord to his
tenants; but the house, inside, had regained its ancient aspect of
comfort under female management, and the scenes of riot common in
Hindley's time were not now enacted within its walls.  The master was too
gloomy to seek companionship with any people, good or bad; and he is yet.

This, however, is not making progress with my story.  Miss Cathy rejected
the peace-offering of the terrier, and demanded her own dogs, Charlie and
Phoenix.  They came limping and hanging their heads; and we set out for
home, sadly out of sorts, every one of us.  I could not wring from my
little lady how she had spent the day; except that, as I supposed, the
goal of her pilgrimage was Penistone Crags; and she arrived without
adventure to the gate of the farm-house, when Hareton happened to issue
forth, attended by some canine followers, who attacked her train.  They
had a smart battle, before their owners could separate them: that formed
an introduction.  Catherine told Hareton who she was, and where she was
going; and asked him to show her the way: finally, beguiling him to
accompany her.  He opened the mysteries of the Fairy Cave, and twenty
other queer places.  But, being in disgrace, I was not favoured with a
description of the interesting objects she saw.  I could gather, however,
that her guide had been a favourite till she hurt his feelings by
addressing him as a servant; and Heathcliff's housekeeper hurt hers by
calling him her cousin.  Then the language he had held to her rankled in
her heart; she who was always 'love,' and 'darling,' and 'queen,' and
'angel,' with everybody at the Grange, to be insulted so shockingly by a
stranger!  She did not comprehend it; and hard work I had to obtain a
promise that she would not lay the grievance before her father.  I
explained how he objected to the whole household at the Heights, and how
sorry he would be to find she had been there; but I insisted most on the
fact, that if she revealed my negligence of his orders, he would perhaps
be so angry that I should have to leave; and Cathy couldn't bear that
prospect: she pledged her word, and kept it for my sake.  After all, she
was a sweet little girl.




CHAPTER XIX


A letter, edged with black, announced the day of my master's return.
Isabella was dead; and he wrote to bid me get mourning for his daughter,
and arrange a room, and other accommodations, for his youthful nephew.
Catherine ran wild with joy at the idea of welcoming her father back; and
indulged most sanguine anticipations of the innumerable excellencies of
her 'real' cousin.  The evening of their expected arrival came.  Since
early morning she had been busy ordering her own small affairs; and now
attired in her new black frock--poor thing! her aunt's death impressed
her with no definite sorrow--she obliged me, by constant worrying, to
walk with her down through the grounds to meet them.

'Linton is just six months younger than I am,' she chattered, as we
strolled leisurely over the swells and hollows of mossy turf, under
shadow of the trees.  'How delightful it will be to have him for a
playfellow!  Aunt Isabella sent papa a beautiful lock of his hair; it was
lighter than mine--more flaxen, and quite as fine.  I have it carefully
preserved in a little glass box; and I've often thought what a pleasure
it would be to see its owner.  Oh! I am happy--and papa, dear, dear papa!
Come, Ellen, let us run! come, run.'

She ran, and returned and ran again, many times before my sober footsteps
reached the gate, and then she seated herself on the grassy bank beside
the path, and tried to wait patiently; but that was impossible: she
couldn't be still a minute.

'How long they are!' she exclaimed.  'Ah, I see, some dust on the
road--they are coming!  No!  When will they be here?  May we not go a
little way--half a mile, Ellen, only just half a mile?  Do say Yes: to
that clump of birches at the turn!'

I refused staunchly.  At length her suspense was ended: the travelling
carriage rolled in sight.  Miss Cathy shrieked and stretched out her arms
as soon as she caught her father's face looking from the window.  He
descended, nearly as eager as herself; and a considerable interval
elapsed ere they had a thought to spare for any but themselves.  While
they exchanged caresses I took a peep in to see after Linton.  He was
asleep in a corner, wrapped in a warm, fur-lined cloak, as if it had been
winter.  A pale, delicate, effeminate boy, who might have been taken for
my master's younger brother, so strong was the resemblance: but there was
a sickly peevishness in his aspect that Edgar Linton never had.  The
latter saw me looking; and having shaken hands, advised me to close the
door, and leave him undisturbed; for the journey had fatigued him.  Cathy
would fain have taken one glance, but her father told her to come, and
they walked together up the park, while I hastened before to prepare the
servants.

'Now, darling,' said Mr. Linton, addressing his daughter, as they halted
at the bottom of the front steps: 'your cousin is not so strong or so
merry as you are, and he has lost his mother, remember, a very short time
since; therefore, don't expect him to play and run about with you
directly.  And don't harass him much by talking: let him be quiet this
evening, at least, will you?'

'Yes, yes, papa,' answered Catherine: 'but I do want to see him; and he
hasn't once looked out.'

The carriage stopped; and the sleeper being roused, was lifted to the
ground by his uncle.

'This is your cousin Cathy, Linton,' he said, putting their little hands
together.  'She's fond of you already; and mind you don't grieve her by
crying to-night.  Try to be cheerful now; the travelling is at an end,
and you have nothing to do but rest and amuse yourself as you please.'

'Let me go to bed, then,' answered the boy, shrinking from Catherine's
salute; and he put his fingers to remove incipient tears.

'Come, come, there's a good child,' I whispered, leading him in.  'You'll
make her weep too--see how sorry she is for you!'

I do not know whether it was sorrow for him, but his cousin put on as sad
a countenance as himself, and returned to her father.  All three entered,
and mounted to the library, where tea was laid ready.  I proceeded to
remove Linton's cap and mantle, and placed him on a chair by the table;
but he was no sooner seated than he began to cry afresh.  My master
inquired what was the matter.

'I can't sit on a chair,' sobbed the boy.

'Go to the sofa, then, and Ellen shall bring you some tea,' answered his
uncle patiently.

He had been greatly tried, during the journey, I felt convinced, by his
fretful ailing charge.  Linton slowly trailed himself off, and lay down.
Cathy carried a footstool and her cup to his side.  At first she sat
silent; but that could not last: she had resolved to make a pet of her
little cousin, as she would have him to be; and she commenced stroking
his curls, and kissing his cheek, and offering him tea in her saucer,
like a baby.  This pleased him, for he was not much better: he dried his
eyes, and lightened into a faint smile.

'Oh, he'll do very well,' said the master to me, after watching them a
minute.  'Very well, if we can keep him, Ellen.  The company of a child
of his own age will instil new spirit into him soon, and by wishing for
strength he'll gain it.'

'Ay, if we can keep him!' I mused to myself; and sore misgivings came
over me that there was slight hope of that.  And then, I thought, how
ever will that weakling live at Wuthering Heights?  Between his father
and Hareton, what playmates and instructors they'll be.  Our doubts were
presently decided--even earlier than I expected.  I had just taken the
children up-stairs, after tea was finished, and seen Linton asleep--he
would not suffer me to leave him till that was the case--I had come down,
and was standing by the table in the hall, lighting a bedroom candle for
Mr. Edgar, when a maid stepped out of the kitchen and informed me that
Mr. Heathcliff's servant Joseph was at the door, and wished to speak with
the master.

'I shall ask him what he wants first,' I said, in considerable
trepidation.  'A very unlikely hour to be troubling people, and the
instant they have returned from a long journey.  I don't think the master
can see him.'

Joseph had advanced through the kitchen as I uttered these words, and now
presented himself in the hall.  He was donned in his Sunday garments,
with his most sanctimonious and sourest face, and, holding his hat in one
hand, and his stick in the other, he proceeded to clean his shoes on the
mat.

'Good-evening, Joseph,' I said, coldly.  'What business brings you here
to-night?'

'It's Maister Linton I mun spake to,' he answered, waving me disdainfully
aside.

'Mr. Linton is going to bed; unless you have something particular to say,
I'm sure he won't hear it now,' I continued.  'You had better sit down in
there, and entrust your message to me.'

'Which is his rahm?' pursued the fellow, surveying the range of closed
doors.

I perceived he was bent on refusing my mediation, so very reluctantly I
went up to the library, and announced the unseasonable visitor, advising
that he should be dismissed till next day.  Mr. Linton had no time to
empower me to do so, for Joseph mounted close at my heels, and, pushing
into the apartment, planted himself at the far side of the table, with
his two fists clapped on the head of his stick, and began in an elevated
tone, as if anticipating opposition--

'Hathecliff has sent me for his lad, and I munn't goa back 'bout him.'

Edgar Linton was silent a minute; an expression of exceeding sorrow
overcast his features: he would have pitied the child on his own account;
but, recalling Isabella's hopes and fears, and anxious wishes for her
son, and her commendations of him to his care, he grieved bitterly at the
prospect of yielding him up, and searched in his heart how it might be
avoided.  No plan offered itself: the very exhibition of any desire to
keep him would have rendered the claimant more peremptory: there was
nothing left but to resign him.  However, he was not going to rouse him
from his sleep.

'Tell Mr. Heathcliff,' he answered calmly, 'that his son shall come to
Wuthering Heights to-morrow.  He is in bed, and too tired to go the
distance now.  You may also tell him that the mother of Linton desired
him to remain under my guardianship; and, at present, his health is very
precarious.'

'Noa!' said Joseph, giving a thud with his prop on the floor, and
assuming an authoritative air.  'Noa! that means naught.  Hathecliff maks
noa 'count o' t' mother, nor ye norther; but he'll heu' his lad; und I
mun tak' him--soa now ye knaw!'

'You shall not to-night!' answered Linton decisively.  'Walk down stairs
at once, and repeat to your master what I have said.  Ellen, show him
down.  Go--'

And, aiding the indignant elder with a lift by the arm, he rid the room
of him and closed the door.

'Varrah weell!' shouted Joseph, as he slowly drew off.  'To-morn, he's
come hisseln, and thrust _him_ out, if ye darr!'




CHAPTER XX


To obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled, Mr. Linton
commissioned me to take the boy home early, on Catherine's pony; and,
said he--'As we shall now have no influence over his destiny, good or
bad, you must say nothing of where he is gone to my daughter: she cannot
associate with him hereafter, and it is better for her to remain in
ignorance of his proximity; lest she should be restless, and anxious to
visit the Heights.  Merely tell her his father sent for him suddenly, and
he has been obliged to leave us.'

Linton was very reluctant to be roused from his bed at five o'clock, and
astonished to be informed that he must prepare for further travelling;
but I softened off the matter by stating that he was going to spend some
time with his father, Mr. Heathcliff, who wished to see him so much, he
did not like to defer the pleasure till he should recover from his late
journey.

'My father!' he cried, in strange perplexity.  'Mamma never told me I had
a father.  Where does he live?  I'd rather stay with uncle.'

'He lives a little distance from the Grange,' I replied; 'just beyond
those hills: not so far, but you may walk over here when you get hearty.
And you should be glad to go home, and to see him.  You must try to love
him, as you did your mother, and then he will love you.'

'But why have I not heard of him before?' asked Linton.  'Why didn't
mamma and he live together, as other people do?'

'He had business to keep him in the north,' I answered, 'and your
mother's health required her to reside in the south.'

'And why didn't mamma speak to me about him?' persevered the child.  'She
often talked of uncle, and I learnt to love him long ago.  How am I to
love papa?  I don't know him.'

'Oh, all children love their parents,' I said.  'Your mother, perhaps,
thought you would want to be with him if she mentioned him often to you.
Let us make haste.  An early ride on such a beautiful morning is much
preferable to an hour's more sleep.'

'Is _she_ to go with us,' he demanded, 'the little girl I saw yesterday?'

'Not now,' replied I.

'Is uncle?' he continued.

'No, I shall be your companion there,' I said.

Linton sank back on his pillow and fell into a brown study.

'I won't go without uncle,' he cried at length: 'I can't tell where you
mean to take me.'

I attempted to persuade him of the naughtiness of showing reluctance to
meet his father; still he obstinately resisted any progress towards
dressing, and I had to call for my master's assistance in coaxing him out
of bed.  The poor thing was finally got off, with several delusive
assurances that his absence should be short: that Mr. Edgar and Cathy
would visit him, and other promises, equally ill-founded, which I
invented and reiterated at intervals throughout the way.  The pure
heather-scented air, the bright sunshine, and the gentle canter of Minny,
relieved his despondency after a while.  He began to put questions
concerning his new home, and its inhabitants, with greater interest and
liveliness.

'Is Wuthering Heights as pleasant a place as Thrushcross Grange?' he
inquired, turning to take a last glance into the valley, whence a light
mist mounted and formed a fleecy cloud on the skirts of the blue.

'It is not so buried in trees,' I replied, 'and it is not quite so large,
but you can see the country beautifully all round; and the air is
healthier for you--fresher and drier.  You will, perhaps, think the
building old and dark at first; though it is a respectable house: the
next best in the neighbourhood.  And you will have such nice rambles on
the moors.  Hareton Earnshaw--that is, Miss Cathy's other cousin, and so
yours in a manner--will show you all the sweetest spots; and you can
bring a book in fine weather, and make a green hollow your study; and,
now and then, your uncle may join you in a walk: he does, frequently,
walk out on the hills.'

'And what is my father like?' he asked.  'Is he as young and handsome as
uncle?'

'He's as young,' said I; 'but he has black hair and eyes, and looks
sterner; and he is taller and bigger altogether.  He'll not seem to you
so gentle and kind at first, perhaps, because it is not his way: still,
mind you, be frank and cordial with him; and naturally he'll be fonder of
you than any uncle, for you are his own.'

'Black hair and eyes!' mused Linton.  'I can't fancy him.  Then I am not
like him, am I?'

'Not much,' I answered: not a morsel, I thought, surveying with regret
the white complexion and slim frame of my companion, and his large
languid eyes--his mother's eyes, save that, unless a morbid touchiness
kindled them a moment, they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit.

'How strange that he should never come to see mamma and me!' he murmured.
'Has he ever seen me?  If he has, I must have been a baby.  I remember
not a single thing about him!'

'Why, Master Linton,' said I, 'three hundred miles is a great distance;
and ten years seem very different in length to a grown-up person compared
with what they do to you.  It is probable Mr. Heathcliff proposed going
from summer to summer, but never found a convenient opportunity; and now
it is too late.  Don't trouble him with questions on the subject: it will
disturb him, for no good.'

The boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the remainder of
the ride, till we halted before the farmhouse garden-gate.  I watched to
catch his impressions in his countenance.  He surveyed the carved front
and low-browed lattices, the straggling gooseberry-bushes and crooked
firs, with solemn intentness, and then shook his head: his private
feelings entirely disapproved of the exterior of his new abode.  But he
had sense to postpone complaining: there might be compensation within.
Before he dismounted, I went and opened the door.  It was half-past six;
the family had just finished breakfast: the servant was clearing and
wiping down the table.  Joseph stood by his master's chair telling some
tale concerning a lame horse; and Hareton was preparing for the hayfield.

'Hallo, Nelly!' said Mr. Heathcliff, when he saw me.  'I feared I should
have to come down and fetch my property myself.  You've brought it, have
you?  Let us see what we can make of it.'

He got up and strode to the door: Hareton and Joseph followed in gaping
curiosity.  Poor Linton ran a frightened eye over the faces of the three.

'Sure-ly,' said Joseph after a grave inspection, 'he's swopped wi' ye,
Maister, an' yon's his lass!'

Heathcliff, having stared his son into an ague of confusion, uttered a
scornful laugh.

'God! what a beauty! what a lovely, charming thing!' he exclaimed.
'Hav'n't they reared it on snails and sour milk, Nelly?  Oh, damn my
soul! but that's worse than I expected--and the devil knows I was not
sanguine!'

I bid the trembling and bewildered child get down, and enter.  He did not
thoroughly comprehend the meaning of his father's speech, or whether it
were intended for him: indeed, he was not yet certain that the grim,
sneering stranger was his father.  But he clung to me with growing
trepidation; and on Mr. Heathcliff's taking a seat and bidding him 'come
hither' he hid his face on my shoulder and wept.

'Tut, tut!' said Heathcliff, stretching out a hand and dragging him
roughly between his knees, and then holding up his head by the chin.
'None of that nonsense!  We're not going to hurt thee, Linton--isn't that
thy name?  Thou art thy mother's child, entirely!  Where is my share in
thee, puling chicken?'

He took off the boy's cap and pushed back his thick flaxen curls, felt
his slender arms and his small fingers; during which examination Linton
ceased crying, and lifted his great blue eyes to inspect the inspector.

'Do you know me?' asked Heathcliff, having satisfied himself that the
limbs were all equally frail and feeble.

'No,' said Linton, with a gaze of vacant fear.

'You've heard of me, I daresay?'

'No,' he replied again.

'No!  What a shame of your mother, never to waken your filial regard for
me!  You are my son, then, I'll tell you; and your mother was a wicked
slut to leave you in ignorance of the sort of father you possessed.  Now,
don't wince, and colour up!  Though it is something to see you have not
white blood.  Be a good lad; and I'll do for you.  Nelly, if you be tired
you may sit down; if not, get home again.  I guess you'll report what you
hear and see to the cipher at the Grange; and this thing won't be settled
while you linger about it.'

'Well,' replied I, 'I hope you'll be kind to the boy, Mr. Heathcliff, or
you'll not keep him long; and he's all you have akin in the wide world,
that you will ever know--remember.'

'I'll be very kind to him, you needn't fear,' he said, laughing.  'Only
nobody else must be kind to him: I'm jealous of monopolising his
affection.  And, to begin my kindness, Joseph, bring the lad some
breakfast.  Hareton, you infernal calf, begone to your work.  Yes, Nell,'
he added, when they had departed, 'my son is prospective owner of your
place, and I should not wish him to die till I was certain of being his
successor.  Besides, he's _mine_, and I want the triumph of seeing _my_
descendant fairly lord of their estates; my child hiring their children
to till their fathers' lands for wages.  That is the sole consideration
which can make me endure the whelp: I despise him for himself, and hate
him for the memories he revives!  But that consideration is sufficient:
he's as safe with me, and shall be tended as carefully as your master
tends his own.  I have a room up-stairs, furnished for him in handsome
style; I've engaged a tutor, also, to come three times a week, from
twenty miles' distance, to teach him what he pleases to learn.  I've
ordered Hareton to obey him: and in fact I've arranged everything with a
view to preserve the superior and the gentleman in him, above his
associates.  I do regret, however, that he so little deserves the
trouble: if I wished any blessing in the world, it was to find him a
worthy object of pride; and I'm bitterly disappointed with the
whey-faced, whining wretch!'

While he was speaking, Joseph returned bearing a basin of milk-porridge,
and placed it before Linton: who stirred round the homely mess with a
look of aversion, and affirmed he could not eat it. I saw the old
man-servant shared largely in his master's scorn of the child; though he
was compelled to retain the sentiment in his heart, because Heathcliff
plainly meant his underlings to hold him in honour.

'Cannot ate it?' repeated he, peering in Linton's face, and subduing his
voice to a whisper, for fear of being overheard.  'But Maister Hareton
nivir ate naught else, when he wer a little 'un; and what wer gooid
enough for him's gooid enough for ye, I's rayther think!'

'I _sha'n't_ eat it!' answered Linton, snappishly.  'Take it away.'

Joseph snatched up the food indignantly, and brought it to us.

'Is there aught ails th' victuals?' he asked, thrusting the tray under
Heathcliff's nose.

'What should ail them?' he said.

'Wah!' answered Joseph, 'yon dainty chap says he cannut ate 'em.  But I
guess it's raight!  His mother wer just soa--we wer a'most too mucky to
sow t' corn for makking her breead.'

'Don't mention his mother to me,' said the master, angrily.  'Get him
something that he can eat, that's all.  What is his usual food, Nelly?'

I suggested boiled milk or tea; and the housekeeper received instructions
to prepare some.  Come, I reflected, his father's selfishness may
contribute to his comfort.  He perceives his delicate constitution, and
the necessity of treating him tolerably.  I'll console Mr. Edgar by
acquainting him with the turn Heathcliff's humour has taken.  Having no
excuse for lingering longer, I slipped out, while Linton was engaged in
timidly rebuffing the advances of a friendly sheep-dog.  But he was too
much on the alert to be cheated: as I closed the door, I heard a cry, and
a frantic repetition of the words--

'Don't leave me!  I'll not stay here!  I'll not stay here!'

Then the latch was raised and fell: they did not suffer him to come
forth.  I mounted Minny, and urged her to a trot; and so my brief
guardianship ended.




CHAPTER XXI


We had sad work with little Cathy that day: she rose in high glee, eager
to join her cousin, and such passionate tears and lamentations followed
the news of his departure that Edgar himself was obliged to soothe her,
by affirming he should come back soon: he added, however, 'if I can get
him'; and there were no hopes of that.  This promise poorly pacified her;
but time was more potent; and though still at intervals she inquired of
her father when Linton would return, before she did see him again his
features had waxed so dim in her memory that she did not recognise him.

When I chanced to encounter the housekeeper of Wuthering Heights, in
paying business visits to Gimmerton, I used to ask how the young master
got on; for he lived almost as secluded as Catherine herself, and was
never to be seen.  I could gather from her that he continued in weak
health, and was a tiresome inmate.  She said Mr. Heathcliff seemed to
dislike him ever longer and worse, though he took some trouble to conceal
it: he had an antipathy to the sound of his voice, and could not do at
all with his sitting in the same room with him many minutes together.
There seldom passed much talk between them: Linton learnt his lessons and
spent his evenings in a small apartment they called the parlour: or else
lay in bed all day: for he was constantly getting coughs, and colds, and
aches, and pains of some sort.

'And I never know such a fainthearted creature,' added the woman; 'nor
one so careful of hisseln. He _will_ go on, if I leave the window open a
bit late in the evening. Oh! it's killing, a breath of night air! And he
must have a fire in the middle of summer; and Joseph's bacca-pipe is
poison; and he must always have sweets and dainties, and always milk,
milk for ever--heeding naught how the rest of us are pinched in winter;
and there he'll sit, wrapped in his furred cloak in his chair by the
fire, with some toast and water or other slop on the hob to sip at; and
if Hareton, for pity, comes to amuse him--Hareton is not bad-natured,
though he's rough--they're sure to part, one swearing and the other
crying. I believe the master would relish Earnshaw's thrashing him to a
mummy, if he were not his son; and I'm certain he would be fit to turn
him out of doors, if he knew half the nursing he gives hisseln. But then
he won't go into danger of temptation: he never enters the parlour, and
should Linton show those ways in the house where he is, he sends him
up-stairs directly.'

I divined, from this account, that utter lack of sympathy had rendered
young Heathcliff selfish and disagreeable, if he were not so originally;
and my interest in him, consequently, decayed: though still I was moved
with a sense of grief at his lot, and a wish that he had been left with
us.  Mr. Edgar encouraged me to gain information: he thought a great deal
about him, I fancy, and would have run some risk to see him; and he told
me once to ask the housekeeper whether he ever came into the village?  She
said he had only been twice, on horseback, accompanying his father; and
both times he pretended to be quite knocked up for three or four days
afterwards.  That housekeeper left, if I recollect rightly, two years
after he came; and another, whom I did not know, was her successor; she
lives there still.

Time wore on at the Grange in its former pleasant way till Miss Cathy
reached sixteen.  On the anniversary of her birth we never manifested any
signs of rejoicing, because it was also the anniversary of my late
mistress's death.  Her father invariably spent that day alone in the
library; and walked, at dusk, as far as Gimmerton kirkyard, where he
would frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight.  Therefore Catherine
was thrown on her own resources for amusement.  This twentieth of March
was a beautiful spring day, and when her father had retired, my young
lady came down dressed for going out, and said she asked to have a ramble
on the edge of the moor with me: Mr. Linton had given her leave, if we
went only a short distance and were back within the hour.

'So make haste, Ellen!' she cried.  'I know where I wish to go; where a
colony of moor-game are settled: I want to see whether they have made
their nests yet.'

'That must be a good distance up,' I answered; 'they don't breed on the
edge of the moor.'

'No, it's not,' she said.  'I've gone very near with papa.'

I put on my bonnet and sallied out, thinking nothing more of the matter.
She bounded before me, and returned to my side, and was off again like a
young greyhound; and, at first, I found plenty of entertainment in
listening to the larks singing far and near, and enjoying the sweet, warm
sunshine; and watching her, my pet and my delight, with her golden
ringlets flying loose behind, and her bright cheek, as soft and pure in
its bloom as a wild rose, and her eyes radiant with cloudless pleasure.
She was a happy creature, and an angel, in those days.  It's a pity she
could not be content.

'Well,' said I, 'where are your moor-game, Miss Cathy?  We should be at
them: the Grange park-fence is a great way off now.'

'Oh, a little further--only a little further, Ellen,' was her answer,
continually.  'Climb to that hillock, pass that bank, and by the time you
reach the other side I shall have raised the birds.'

But there were so many hillocks and banks to climb and pass, that, at
length, I began to be weary, and told her we must halt, and retrace our
steps.  I shouted to her, as she had outstripped me a long way; she
either did not hear or did not regard, for she still sprang on, and I was
compelled to follow.  Finally, she dived into a hollow; and before I came
in sight of her again, she was two miles nearer Wuthering Heights than
her own home; and I beheld a couple of persons arrest her, one of whom I
felt convinced was Mr. Heathcliff himself.

Cathy had been caught in the fact of plundering, or, at least, hunting
out the nests of the grouse.  The Heights were Heathcliff's land, and he
was reproving the poacher.

'I've neither taken any nor found any,' she said, as I toiled to them,
expanding her hands in corroboration of the statement.  'I didn't mean to
take them; but papa told me there were quantities up here, and I wished
to see the eggs.'

Heathcliff glanced at me with an ill-meaning smile, expressing his
acquaintance with the party, and, consequently, his malevolence towards
it, and demanded who 'papa' was?

'Mr. Linton of Thrushcross Grange,' she replied.  'I thought you did not
know me, or you wouldn't have spoken in that way.'

'You suppose papa is highly esteemed and respected, then?' he said,
sarcastically.

'And what are you?' inquired Catherine, gazing curiously on the speaker.
'That man I've seen before.  Is he your son?'

She pointed to Hareton, the other individual, who had gained nothing but
increased bulk and strength by the addition of two years to his age: he
seemed as awkward and rough as ever.

'Miss Cathy,' I interrupted, 'it will be three hours instead of one that
we are out, presently.  We really must go back.'

'No, that man is not my son,' answered Heathcliff, pushing me aside.  'But
I have one, and you have seen him before too; and, though your nurse is
in a hurry, I think both you and she would be the better for a little
rest.  Will you just turn this nab of heath, and walk into my house?
You'll get home earlier for the ease; and you shall receive a kind
welcome.'

I whispered Catherine that she mustn't, on any account, accede to the
proposal: it was entirely out of the question.

'Why?' she asked, aloud.  'I'm tired of running, and the ground is dewy:
I can't sit here.  Let us go, Ellen.  Besides, he says I have seen his
son.  He's mistaken, I think; but I guess where he lives: at the
farmhouse I visited in coming from Penistone Crags.  Don't you?'

'I do.  Come, Nelly, hold your tongue--it will be a treat for her to look
in on us.  Hareton, get forwards with the lass.  You shall walk with me,
Nelly.'

'No, she's not going to any such place,' I cried, struggling to release
my arm, which he had seized: but she was almost at the door-stones
already, scampering round the brow at full speed.  Her appointed
companion did not pretend to escort her: he shied off by the road-side,
and vanished.

'Mr. Heathcliff, it's very wrong,' I continued: 'you know you mean no
good.  And there she'll see Linton, and all will be told as soon as ever
we return; and I shall have the blame.'

'I want her to see Linton,' he answered; 'he's looking better these few
days; it's not often he's fit to be seen.  And we'll soon persuade her to
keep the visit secret: where is the harm of it?'

'The harm of it is, that her father would hate me if he found I suffered
her to enter your house; and I am convinced you have a bad design in
encouraging her to do so,' I replied.

'My design is as honest as possible.  I'll inform you of its whole
scope,' he said.  'That the two cousins may fall in love, and get
married.  I'm acting generously to your master: his young chit has no
expectations, and should she second my wishes she'll be provided for at
once as joint successor with Linton.'

'If Linton died,' I answered, 'and his life is quite uncertain, Catherine
would be the heir.'

'No, she would not,' he said.  'There is no clause in the will to secure
it so: his property would go to me; but, to prevent disputes, I desire
their union, and am resolved to bring it about.'

'And I'm resolved she shall never approach your house with me again,' I
returned, as we reached the gate, where Miss Cathy waited our coming.

Heathcliff bade me be quiet; and, preceding us up the path, hastened to
open the door.  My young lady gave him several looks, as if she could not
exactly make up her mind what to think of him; but now he smiled when he
met her eye, and softened his voice in addressing her; and I was foolish
enough to imagine the memory of her mother might disarm him from desiring
her injury.  Linton stood on the hearth.  He had been out walking in the
fields, for his cap was on, and he was calling to Joseph to bring him dry
shoes.  He had grown tall of his age, still wanting some months of
sixteen.  His features were pretty yet, and his eye and complexion
brighter than I remembered them, though with merely temporary lustre
borrowed from the salubrious air and genial sun.

'Now, who is that?' asked Mr. Heathcliff, turning to Cathy.  'Can you
tell?'

'Your son?' she said, having doubtfully surveyed, first one and then the
other.

'Yes, yes,' answered he: 'but is this the only time you have beheld him?
Think!  Ah! you have a short memory.  Linton, don't you recall your
cousin, that you used to tease us so with wishing to see?'

'What, Linton!' cried Cathy, kindling into joyful surprise at the name.
'Is that little Linton?  He's taller than I am!  Are you Linton?'

The youth stepped forward, and acknowledged himself: she kissed him
fervently, and they gazed with wonder at the change time had wrought in
the appearance of each.  Catherine had reached her full height; her
figure was both plump and slender, elastic as steel, and her whole aspect
sparkling with health and spirits.  Linton's looks and movements were
very languid, and his form extremely slight; but there was a grace in his
manner that mitigated these defects, and rendered him not unpleasing.
After exchanging numerous marks of fondness with him, his cousin went to
Mr. Heathcliff, who lingered by the door, dividing his attention between
the objects inside and those that lay without: pretending, that is, to
observe the latter, and really noting the former alone.

'And you are my uncle, then!' she cried, reaching up to salute him.  'I
thought I liked you, though you were cross at first.  Why don't you visit
at the Grange with Linton?  To live all these years such close
neighbours, and never see us, is odd: what have you done so for?'

'I visited it once or twice too often before you were born,' he answered.
'There--damn it!  If you have any kisses to spare, give them to Linton:
they are thrown away on me.'

'Naughty Ellen!' exclaimed Catherine, flying to attack me next with her
lavish caresses.  'Wicked Ellen! to try to hinder me from entering.  But
I'll take this walk every morning in future: may I, uncle? and sometimes
bring papa.  Won't you be glad to see us?'

'Of course,' replied the uncle, with a hardly suppressed grimace,
resulting from his deep aversion to both the proposed visitors.  'But
stay,' he continued, turning towards the young lady.  'Now I think of it,
I'd better tell you.  Mr. Linton has a prejudice against me: we
quarrelled at one time of our lives, with unchristian ferocity; and, if
you mention coming here to him, he'll put a veto on your visits
altogether.  Therefore, you must not mention it, unless you be careless
of seeing your cousin hereafter: you may come, if you will, but you must
not mention it.'

'Why did you quarrel?' asked Catherine, considerably crestfallen.

'He thought me too poor to wed his sister,' answered Heathcliff, 'and was
grieved that I got her: his pride was hurt, and he'll never forgive it.'

'That's wrong!' said the young lady: 'some time I'll tell him so.  But
Linton and I have no share in your quarrel.  I'll not come here, then; he
shall come to the Grange.'

'It will be too far for me,' murmured her cousin: 'to walk four miles
would kill me.  No, come here, Miss Catherine, now and then: not every
morning, but once or twice a week.'

The father launched towards his son a glance of bitter contempt.

'I am afraid, Nelly, I shall lose my labour,' he muttered to me.  'Miss
Catherine, as the ninny calls her, will discover his value, and send him
to the devil.  Now, if it had been Hareton!--Do you know that, twenty
times a day, I covet Hareton, with all his degradation?  I'd have loved
the lad had he been some one else.  But I think he's safe from _her_
love.  I'll pit him against that paltry creature, unless it bestir itself
briskly.  We calculate it will scarcely last till it is eighteen.  Oh,
confound the vapid thing!  He's absorbed in drying his feet, and never
looks at her.--Linton!'

'Yes, father,' answered the boy.

'Have you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about, not even a rabbit
or a weasel's nest?  Take her into the garden, before you change your
shoes; and into the stable to see your horse.'

'Wouldn't you rather sit here?' asked Linton, addressing Cathy in a tone
which expressed reluctance to move again.

'I don't know,' she replied, casting a longing look to the door, and
evidently eager to be active.

He kept his seat, and shrank closer to the fire.  Heathcliff rose, and
went into the kitchen, and from thence to the yard, calling out for
Hareton.  Hareton responded, and presently the two re-entered.  The young
man had been washing himself, as was visible by the glow on his cheeks
and his wetted hair.

'Oh, I'll ask _you_, uncle,' cried Miss Cathy, recollecting the
housekeeper's assertion.  'That is not my cousin, is he?'

'Yes,' he, replied, 'your mother's nephew.  Don't you like him!'

Catherine looked queer.

'Is he not a handsome lad?' he continued.

The uncivil little thing stood on tiptoe, and whispered a sentence in
Heathcliff's ear.  He laughed; Hareton darkened: I perceived he was very
sensitive to suspected slights, and had obviously a dim notion of his
inferiority.  But his master or guardian chased the frown by exclaiming--

'You'll be the favourite among us, Hareton!  She says you are a--What was
it?  Well, something very flattering.  Here! you go with her round the
farm.  And behave like a gentleman, mind!  Don't use any bad words; and
don't stare when the young lady is not looking at you, and be ready to
hide your face when she is; and, when you speak, say your words slowly,
and keep your hands out of your pockets.  Be off, and entertain her as
nicely as you can.'

He watched the couple walking past the window.  Earnshaw had his
countenance completely averted from his companion.  He seemed studying
the familiar landscape with a stranger's and an artist's interest.
Catherine took a sly look at him, expressing small admiration.  She then
turned her attention to seeking out objects of amusement for herself, and
tripped merrily on, lilting a tune to supply the lack of conversation.

'I've tied his tongue,' observed Heathcliff.  'He'll not venture a single
syllable all the time!  Nelly, you recollect me at his age--nay, some
years younger.  Did I ever look so stupid: so "gaumless," as Joseph calls
it?'

'Worse,' I replied, 'because more sullen with it.'

'I've a pleasure in him,' he continued, reflecting aloud. 'He has
satisfied my expectations. If he were a born fool I should not enjoy it
half so much. But he's no fool; and I can sympathise with all his
feelings, having felt them myself. I know what he suffers now, for
instance, exactly: it is merely a beginning of what he shall suffer,
though. And he'll never be able to emerge from his bathos of coarseness
and ignorance. I've got him faster than his scoundrel of a father
secured me, and lower; for he takes a pride in his brutishness. I've
taught him to scorn everything extra-animal as silly and weak. Don't you
think Hindley would be proud of his son, if he could see him? almost as
proud as I am of mine. But there's this difference; one is gold put to
the use of paving-stones, and the other is tin polished to ape a service
of silver. _Mine_ has nothing valuable about it; yet I shall have the
merit of making it go as far as such poor stuff can go. _His_ had
first-rate qualities, and they are lost: rendered worse than unavailing.
I have nothing to regret; he would have more than any but I are aware
of. And the best of it is, Hareton is damnably fond of me! You'll own
that I've outmatched Hindley there. If the dead villain could rise from
his grave to abuse me for his offspring's wrongs, I should have the fun
of seeing the said offspring fight him back again, indignant that he
should dare to rail at the one friend he has in the world!'

Heathcliff chuckled a fiendish laugh at the idea.  I made no reply,
because I saw that he expected none.  Meantime, our young companion, who
sat too removed from us to hear what was said, began to evince symptoms
of uneasiness, probably repenting that he had denied himself the treat of
Catherine's society for fear of a little fatigue.  His father remarked
the restless glances wandering to the window, and the hand irresolutely
extended towards his cap.

'Get up, you idle boy!' he exclaimed, with assumed heartiness.

'Away after them! they are just at the corner, by the stand of hives.'

Linton gathered his energies, and left the hearth.  The lattice was open,
and, as he stepped out, I heard Cathy inquiring of her unsociable
attendant what was that inscription over the door? Hareton stared up, and
scratched his head like a true clown.

'It's some damnable writing,' he answered.  'I cannot read it.'

'Can't read it?' cried Catherine; 'I can read it: it's English.  But I
want to know why it is there.'

Linton giggled: the first appearance of mirth he had exhibited.

'He does not know his letters,' he said to his cousin.  'Could you
believe in the existence of such a colossal dunce?'

'Is he all as he should be?' asked Miss Cathy, seriously; 'or is he
simple: not right?  I've questioned him twice now, and each time he
looked so stupid I think he does not understand me.  I can hardly
understand him, I'm sure!'

Linton repeated his laugh, and glanced at Hareton tauntingly; who
certainly did not seem quite clear of comprehension at that moment.

'There's nothing the matter but laziness; is there, Earnshaw?' he said.
'My cousin fancies you are an idiot.  There you experience the
consequence of scorning "book-larning," as you would say.  Have you
noticed, Catherine, his frightful Yorkshire pronunciation?'

'Why, where the devil is the use on't?' growled Hareton, more ready in
answering his daily companion.  He was about to enlarge further, but the
two youngsters broke into a noisy fit of merriment: my giddy miss being
delighted to discover that she might turn his strange talk to matter of
amusement.

'Where is the use of the devil in that sentence?' tittered Linton.  'Papa
told you not to say any bad words, and you can't open your mouth without
one.  Do try to behave like a gentleman, now do!'

'If thou weren't more a lass than a lad, I'd fell thee this minute, I
would; pitiful lath of a crater!' retorted the angry boor, retreating,
while his face burnt with mingled rage and mortification! for he was
conscious of being insulted, and embarrassed how to resent it.

Mr. Heathcliff having overheard the conversation, as well as I, smiled
when he saw him go; but immediately afterwards cast a look of singular
aversion on the flippant pair, who remained chattering in the door-way:
the boy finding animation enough while discussing Hareton's faults and
deficiencies, and relating anecdotes of his goings on; and the girl
relishing his pert and spiteful sayings, without considering the
ill-nature they evinced.  I began to dislike, more than to compassionate
Linton, and to excuse his father in some measure for holding him cheap.

We stayed till afternoon: I could not tear Miss Cathy away sooner; but
happily my master had not quitted his apartment, and remained ignorant of
our prolonged absence.  As we walked home, I would fain have enlightened
my charge on the characters of the people we had quitted: but she got it
into her head that I was prejudiced against them.

'Aha!' she cried, 'you take papa's side, Ellen: you are partial I know;
or else you wouldn't have cheated me so many years into the notion that
Linton lived a long way from here.  I'm really extremely angry; only I'm
so pleased I can't show it!  But you must hold your tongue about _my_
uncle; he's my uncle, remember; and I'll scold papa for quarrelling with
him.'

And so she ran on, till I relinquished the endeavour to convince her of
her mistake.  She did not mention the visit that night, because she did
not see Mr. Linton.  Next day it all came out, sadly to my chagrin; and
still I was not altogether sorry: I thought the burden of directing and
warning would be more efficiently borne by him than me.  But he was too
timid in giving satisfactory reasons for his wish that she should shun
connection with the household of the Heights, and Catherine liked good
reasons for every restraint that harassed her petted will.

'Papa!' she exclaimed, after the morning's salutations, 'guess whom I saw
yesterday, in my walk on the moors.  Ah, papa, you started! you've not
done right, have you, now?  I saw--but listen, and you shall hear how I
found you out; and Ellen, who is in league with you, and yet pretended to
pity me so, when I kept hoping, and was always disappointed about
Linton's coming back!'

She gave a faithful account of her excursion and its consequences; and my
master, though he cast more than one reproachful look at me, said nothing
till she had concluded.  Then he drew her to him, and asked if she knew
why he had concealed Linton's near neighbourhood from her?  Could she
think it was to deny her a pleasure that she might harmlessly enjoy?

'It was because you disliked Mr. Heathcliff,' she answered.

'Then you believe I care more for my own feelings than yours, Cathy?' he
said.  'No, it was not because I disliked Mr. Heathcliff, but because Mr.
Heathcliff dislikes me; and is a most diabolical man, delighting to wrong
and ruin those he hates, if they give him the slightest opportunity.  I
knew that you could not keep up an acquaintance with your cousin without
being brought into contact with him; and I knew he would detest you on my
account; so for your own good, and nothing else, I took precautions that
you should not see Linton again.  I meant to explain this some time as
you grew older, and I'm sorry I delayed it.'

'But Mr. Heathcliff was quite cordial, papa,' observed Catherine, not at
all convinced; 'and he didn't object to our seeing each other: he said I
might come to his house when I pleased; only I must not tell you, because
you had quarrelled with him, and would not forgive him for marrying aunt
Isabella.  And you won't.  _You_ are the one to be blamed: he is willing
to let us be friends, at least; Linton and I; and you are not.'

My master, perceiving that she would not take his word for her
uncle-in-law's evil disposition, gave a hasty sketch of his conduct to
Isabella, and the manner in which Wuthering Heights became his property.
He could not bear to discourse long upon the topic; for though he spoke
little of it, he still felt the same horror and detestation of his
ancient enemy that had occupied his heart ever since Mrs. Linton's
death. 'She might have been living yet, if it had not been for him!' was
his constant bitter reflection; and, in his eyes, Heathcliff seemed a
murderer. Miss Cathy--conversant with no bad deeds except her own slight
acts of disobedience, injustice, and passion, arising from hot temper
and thoughtlessness, and repented of on the day they were committed--was
amazed at the blackness of spirit that could brood on and cover revenge
for years, and deliberately prosecute its plans without a visitation of
remorse. She appeared so deeply impressed and shocked at this new view
of human nature--excluded from all her studies and all her ideas till
now--that Mr. Edgar deemed it unnecessary to pursue the subject. He
merely added: 'You will know hereafter, darling, why I wish you to avoid
his house and family; now return to your old employments and amusements,
and think no more about them.'

Catherine kissed her father, and sat down quietly to her lessons for a
couple of hours, according to custom; then she accompanied him into the
grounds, and the whole day passed as usual: but in the evening, when she
had retired to her room, and I went to help her to undress, I found her
crying, on her knees by the bedside.

'Oh, fie, silly child!' I exclaimed.  'If you had any real griefs you'd
be ashamed to waste a tear on this little contrariety.  You never had one
shadow of substantial sorrow, Miss Catherine.  Suppose, for a minute,
that master and I were dead, and you were by yourself in the world: how
would you feel, then?  Compare the present occasion with such an
affliction as that, and be thankful for the friends you have, instead of
coveting more.'

'I'm not crying for myself, Ellen,' she answered, 'it's for him.  He
expected to see me again to-morrow, and there he'll be so disappointed:
and he'll wait for me, and I sha'n't come!'

'Nonsense!' said I, 'do you imagine he has thought as much of you as you
have of him?  Hasn't he Hareton for a companion?  Not one in a hundred
would weep at losing a relation they had just seen twice, for two
afternoons.  Linton will conjecture how it is, and trouble himself no
further about you.'

'But may I not write a note to tell him why I cannot come?' she asked,
rising to her feet.  'And just send those books I promised to lend him?
His books are not as nice as mine, and he wanted to have them extremely,
when I told him how interesting they were.  May I not, Ellen?'

'No, indeed! no, indeed!' replied I with decision.  'Then he would write
to you, and there'd never be an end of it.  No, Miss Catherine, the
acquaintance must be dropped entirely: so papa expects, and I shall see
that it is done.'

'But how can one little note--?' she recommenced, putting on an imploring
countenance.

'Silence!' I interrupted.  'We'll not begin with your little notes.  Get
into bed.'

She threw at me a very naughty look, so naughty that I would not kiss her
good-night at first: I covered her up, and shut her door, in great
displeasure; but, repenting half-way, I returned softly, and lo! there
was Miss standing at the table with a bit of blank paper before her and a
pencil in her hand, which she guiltily slipped out of sight on my
entrance.

'You'll get nobody to take that, Catherine,' I said, 'if you write it;
and at present I shall put out your candle.'

I set the extinguisher on the flame, receiving as I did so a slap on my
hand and a petulant 'cross thing!'  I then quitted her again, and she
drew the bolt in one of her worst, most peevish humours.  The letter was
finished and forwarded to its destination by a milk-fetcher who came from
the village; but that I didn't learn till some time afterwards.  Weeks
passed on, and Cathy recovered her temper; though she grew wondrous fond
of stealing off to corners by herself and often, if I came near her
suddenly while reading, she would start and bend over the book, evidently
desirous to hide it; and I detected edges of loose paper sticking out
beyond the leaves.  She also got a trick of coming down early in the
morning and lingering about the kitchen, as if she were expecting the
arrival of something; and she had a small drawer in a cabinet in the
library, which she would trifle over for hours, and whose key she took
special care to remove when she left it.

One day, as she inspected this drawer, I observed that the playthings and
trinkets which recently formed its contents were transmuted into bits of
folded paper.  My curiosity and suspicions were roused; I determined to
take a peep at her mysterious treasures; so, at night, as soon as she and
my master were safe upstairs, I searched, and readily found among my
house keys one that would fit the lock.  Having opened, I emptied the
whole contents into my apron, and took them with me to examine at leisure
in my own chamber.  Though I could not but suspect, I was still surprised
to discover that they were a mass of correspondence--daily almost, it
must have been--from Linton Heathcliff: answers to documents forwarded by
her.  The earlier dated were embarrassed and short; gradually, however,
they expanded into copious love-letters, foolish, as the age of the
writer rendered natural, yet with touches here and there which I thought
were borrowed from a more experienced source.  Some of them struck me as
singularly odd compounds of ardour and flatness; commencing in strong
feeling, and concluding in the affected, wordy style that a schoolboy
might use to a fancied, incorporeal sweetheart.  Whether they satisfied
Cathy I don't know; but they appeared very worthless trash to me.  After
turning over as many as I thought proper, I tied them in a handkerchief
and set them aside, relocking the vacant drawer.

Following her habit, my young lady descended early, and visited the
kitchen: I watched her go to the door, on the arrival of a certain little
boy; and, while the dairymaid filled his can, she tucked something into
his jacket pocket, and plucked something out.  I went round by the
garden, and laid wait for the messenger; who fought valorously to defend
his trust, and we spilt the milk between us; but I succeeded in
abstracting the epistle; and, threatening serious consequences if he did
not look sharp home, I remained under the wall and perused Miss Cathy's
affectionate composition.  It was more simple and more eloquent than her
cousin's: very pretty and very silly.  I shook my head, and went
meditating into the house.  The day being wet, she could not divert
herself with rambling about the park; so, at the conclusion of her
morning studies, she resorted to the solace of the drawer.  Her father
sat reading at the table; and I, on purpose, had sought a bit of work in
some unripped fringes of the window-curtain, keeping my eye steadily
fixed on her proceedings.  Never did any bird flying back to a plundered
nest, which it had left brimful of chirping young ones, express more
complete despair, in its anguished cries and flutterings, than she by her
single 'Oh!' and the change that transfigured her late happy countenance.
Mr. Linton looked up.

'What is the matter, love?  Have you hurt yourself?' he said.

His tone and look assured her _he_ had not been the discoverer of the
hoard.

'No, papa!' she gasped.  'Ellen! Ellen! come up-stairs--I'm sick!'

I obeyed her summons, and accompanied her out.

'Oh, Ellen! you have got them,' she commenced immediately, dropping on
her knees, when we were enclosed alone.  'Oh, give them to me, and I'll
never, never do so again!  Don't tell papa.  You have not told papa,
Ellen? say you have not?  I've been exceedingly naughty, but I won't do
it any more!'

With a grave severity in my manner I bade her stand up.

'So,' I exclaimed, 'Miss Catherine, you are tolerably far on, it seems:
you may well be ashamed of them!  A fine bundle of trash you study in
your leisure hours, to be sure: why, it's good enough to be printed!  And
what do you suppose the master will think when I display it before him?  I
hav'n't shown it yet, but you needn't imagine I shall keep your
ridiculous secrets.  For shame! and you must have led the way in writing
such absurdities: he would not have thought of beginning, I'm certain.'

'I didn't!  I didn't!' sobbed Cathy, fit to break her heart.  'I didn't
once think of loving him till--'

'_Loving_!' cried I, as scornfully as I could utter the word.  '_Loving_!
Did anybody ever hear the like!  I might just as well talk of loving the
miller who comes once a year to buy our corn.  Pretty loving, indeed! and
both times together you have seen Linton hardly four hours in your life!
Now here is the babyish trash.  I'm going with it to the library; and
we'll see what your father says to such _loving_.'

She sprang at her precious epistles, but I held them above my head; and
then she poured out further frantic entreaties that I would burn them--do
anything rather than show them.  And being really fully as much inclined
to laugh as scold--for I esteemed it all girlish vanity--I at length
relented in a measure, and asked,--'If I consent to burn them, will you
promise faithfully neither to send nor receive a letter again, nor a book
(for I perceive you have sent him books), nor locks of hair, nor rings,
nor playthings?'

'We don't send playthings,' cried Catherine, her pride overcoming her
shame.

'Nor anything at all, then, my lady?' I said.  'Unless you will, here I
go.'

'I promise, Ellen!' she cried, catching my dress.  'Oh, put them in the
fire, do, do!'

But when I proceeded to open a place with the poker the sacrifice was too
painful to be borne.  She earnestly supplicated that I would spare her
one or two.

'One or two, Ellen, to keep for Linton's sake!'

I unknotted the handkerchief, and commenced dropping them in from an
angle, and the flame curled up the chimney.

'I will have one, you cruel wretch!' she screamed, darting her hand into
the fire, and drawing forth some half-consumed fragments, at the expense
of her fingers.

'Very well--and I will have some to exhibit to papa!'  I answered,
shaking back the rest into the bundle, and turning anew to the door.

She emptied her blackened pieces into the flames, and motioned me to
finish the immolation.  It was done; I stirred up the ashes, and interred
them under a shovelful of coals; and she mutely, and with a sense of
intense injury, retired to her private apartment.  I descended to tell my
master that the young lady's qualm of sickness was almost gone, but I
judged it best for her to lie down a while.  She wouldn't dine; but she
reappeared at tea, pale, and red about the eyes, and marvellously subdued
in outward aspect.  Next morning I answered the letter by a slip of
paper, inscribed, 'Master Heathcliff is requested to send no more notes
to Miss Linton, as she will not receive them.'  And, henceforth, the
little boy came with vacant pockets.




CHAPTER XXII


Summer drew to an end, and early autumn: it was past Michaelmas, but the
harvest was late that year, and a few of our fields were still uncleared.
Mr. Linton and his daughter would frequently walk out among the reapers;
at the carrying of the last sheaves they stayed till dusk, and the
evening happening to be chill and damp, my master caught a bad cold, that
settled obstinately on his lungs, and confined him indoors throughout the
whole of the winter, nearly without intermission.

Poor Cathy, frightened from her little romance, had been considerably
sadder and duller since its abandonment; and her father insisted on her
reading less, and taking more exercise.  She had his companionship no
longer; I esteemed it a duty to supply its lack, as much as possible,
with mine: an inefficient substitute; for I could only spare two or three
hours, from my numerous diurnal occupations, to follow her footsteps, and
then my society was obviously less desirable than his.

On an afternoon in October, or the beginning of November--a fresh watery
afternoon, when the turf and paths were rustling with moist, withered
leaves, and the cold blue sky was half hidden by clouds--dark grey
streamers, rapidly mounting from the west, and boding abundant rain--I
requested my young lady to forego her ramble, because I was certain of
showers.  She refused; and I unwillingly donned a cloak, and took my
umbrella to accompany her on a stroll to the bottom of the park: a formal
walk which she generally affected if low-spirited--and that she
invariably was when Mr. Edgar had been worse than ordinary, a thing never
known from his confession, but guessed both by her and me from his
increased silence and the melancholy of his countenance.  She went sadly
on: there was no running or bounding now, though the chill wind might
well have tempted her to race.  And often, from the side of my eye, I
could detect her raising a hand, and brushing something off her cheek.  I
gazed round for a means of diverting her thoughts.  On one side of the
road rose a high, rough bank, where hazels and stunted oaks, with their
roots half exposed, held uncertain tenure: the soil was too loose for the
latter; and strong winds had blown some nearly horizontal.  In summer
Miss Catherine delighted to climb along these trunks, and sit in the
branches, swinging twenty feet above the ground; and I, pleased with her
agility and her light, childish heart, still considered it proper to
scold every time I caught her at such an elevation, but so that she knew
there was no necessity for descending.  From dinner to tea she would lie
in her breeze-rocked cradle, doing nothing except singing old songs--my
nursery lore--to herself, or watching the birds, joint tenants, feed and
entice their young ones to fly: or nestling with closed lids, half
thinking, half dreaming, happier than words can express.

'Look, Miss!' I exclaimed, pointing to a nook under the roots of one
twisted tree.  'Winter is not here yet.  There's a little flower up
yonder, the last bud from the multitude of bluebells that clouded those
turf steps in July with a lilac mist.  Will you clamber up, and pluck it
to show to papa?'  Cathy stared a long time at the lonely blossom
trembling in its earthy shelter, and replied, at length--'No, I'll not
touch it: but it looks melancholy, does it not, Ellen?'

'Yes,' I observed, 'about as starved and suckless as you: your cheeks are
bloodless; let us take hold of hands and run.  You're so low, I daresay I
shall keep up with you.'

'No,' she repeated, and continued sauntering on, pausing at intervals to
muse over a bit of moss, or a tuft of blanched grass, or a fungus
spreading its bright orange among the heaps of brown foliage; and, ever
and anon, her hand was lifted to her averted face.

'Catherine, why are you crying, love?' I asked, approaching and putting
my arm over her shoulder.  'You mustn't cry because papa has a cold; be
thankful it is nothing worse.'

She now put no further restraint on her tears; her breath was stifled by
sobs.

'Oh, it will be something worse,' she said.  'And what shall I do when
papa and you leave me, and I am by myself?  I can't forget your words,
Ellen; they are always in my ear.  How life will be changed, how dreary
the world will be, when papa and you are dead.'

'None can tell whether you won't die before us,' I replied.  'It's wrong
to anticipate evil.  We'll hope there are years and years to come before
any of us go: master is young, and I am strong, and hardly forty-five.  My
mother lived till eighty, a canty dame to the last.  And suppose Mr.
Linton were spared till he saw sixty, that would be more years than you
have counted, Miss.  And would it not be foolish to mourn a calamity
above twenty years beforehand?'

'But Aunt Isabella was younger than papa,' she remarked, gazing up with
timid hope to seek further consolation.

'Aunt Isabella had not you and me to nurse her,' I replied.  'She wasn't
as happy as Master: she hadn't as much to live for.  All you need do, is
to wait well on your father, and cheer him by letting him see you
cheerful; and avoid giving him anxiety on any subject: mind that, Cathy!
I'll not disguise but you might kill him if you were wild and reckless,
and cherished a foolish, fanciful affection for the son of a person who
would be glad to have him in his grave; and allowed him to discover that
you fretted over the separation he has judged it expedient to make.'

'I fret about nothing on earth except papa's illness,' answered my
companion.  'I care for nothing in comparison with papa.  And I'll
never--never--oh, never, while I have my senses, do an act or say a word
to vex him.  I love him better than myself, Ellen; and I know it by this:
I pray every night that I may live after him; because I would rather be
miserable than that he should be: that proves I love him better than
myself.'

'Good words,' I replied.  'But deeds must prove it also; and after he is
well, remember you don't forget resolutions formed in the hour of fear.'

As we talked, we neared a door that opened on the road; and my young
lady, lightening into sunshine again, climbed up and seated herself on
the top of the wall, reaching over to gather some hips that bloomed
scarlet on the summit branches of the wild-rose trees shadowing the
highway side: the lower fruit had disappeared, but only birds could touch
the upper, except from Cathy's present station.  In stretching to pull
them, her hat fell off; and as the door was locked, she proposed
scrambling down to recover it.  I bid her be cautious lest she got a
fall, and she nimbly disappeared.  But the return was no such easy
matter: the stones were smooth and neatly cemented, and the rose-bushes
and black-berry stragglers could yield no assistance in re-ascending.  I,
like a fool, didn't recollect that, till I heard her laughing and
exclaiming--'Ellen! you'll have to fetch the key, or else I must run
round to the porter's lodge.  I can't scale the ramparts on this side!'

'Stay where you are,' I answered; 'I have my bundle of keys in my pocket:
perhaps I may manage to open it; if not, I'll go.'

Catherine amused herself with dancing to and fro before the door, while I
tried all the large keys in succession.  I had applied the last, and
found that none would do; so, repeating my desire that she would remain
there, I was about to hurry home as fast as I could, when an approaching
sound arrested me.  It was the trot of a horse; Cathy's dance stopped
also.

'Who is that?' I whispered.

'Ellen, I wish you could open the door,' whispered back my companion,
anxiously.

'Ho, Miss Linton!' cried a deep voice (the rider's), 'I'm glad to meet
you.  Don't be in haste to enter, for I have an explanation to ask and
obtain.'

'I sha'n't speak to you, Mr. Heathcliff,' answered Catherine.  'Papa says
you are a wicked man, and you hate both him and me; and Ellen says the
same.'

'That is nothing to the purpose,' said Heathcliff.  (He it was.)  'I
don't hate my son, I suppose; and it is concerning him that I demand your
attention.  Yes; you have cause to blush.  Two or three months since,
were you not in the habit of writing to Linton? making love in play, eh?
You deserved, both of you, flogging for that!  You especially, the elder;
and less sensitive, as it turns out.  I've got your letters, and if you
give me any pertness I'll send them to your father.  I presume you grew
weary of the amusement and dropped it, didn't you?  Well, you dropped
Linton with it into a Slough of Despond.  He was in earnest: in love,
really.  As true as I live, he's dying for you; breaking his heart at
your fickleness: not figuratively, but actually.  Though Hareton has made
him a standing jest for six weeks, and I have used more serious measures,
and attempted to frighten him out of his idiotcy, he gets worse daily;
and he'll be under the sod before summer, unless you restore him!'

'How can you lie so glaringly to the poor child?' I called from the
inside.  'Pray ride on!  How can you deliberately get up such paltry
falsehoods?  Miss Cathy, I'll knock the lock off with a stone: you won't
believe that vile nonsense.  You can feel in yourself it is impossible
that a person should die for love of a stranger.'

'I was not aware there were eavesdroppers,' muttered the detected
villain. 'Worthy Mrs. Dean, I like you, but I don't like your
double-dealing,' he added aloud. 'How could _you_ lie so glaringly as to
affirm I hated the "poor child"? and invent bugbear stories to terrify
her from my door-stones? Catherine Linton (the very name warms me), my
bonny lass, I shall be from home all this week; go and see if have not
spoken truth: do, there's a darling! Just imagine your father in my
place, and Linton in yours; then think how you would value your careless
lover if he refused to stir a step to comfort you, when your father
himself entreated him; and don't, from pure stupidity, fall into the
same error. I swear, on my salvation, he's going to his grave, and none
but you can save him!'

The lock gave way and I issued out.

'I swear Linton is dying,' repeated Heathcliff, looking hard at me.  'And
grief and disappointment are hastening his death.  Nelly, if you won't
let her go, you can walk over yourself.  But I shall not return till this
time next week; and I think your master himself would scarcely object to
her visiting her cousin.'

'Come in,' said I, taking Cathy by the arm and half forcing her to
re-enter; for she lingered, viewing with troubled eyes the features of
the speaker, too stern to express his inward deceit.

He pushed his horse close, and, bending down, observed--'Miss Catherine,
I'll own to you that I have little patience with Linton; and Hareton and
Joseph have less.  I'll own that he's with a harsh set.  He pines for
kindness, as well as love; and a kind word from you would be his best
medicine.  Don't mind Mrs. Dean's cruel cautions; but be generous, and
contrive to see him.  He dreams of you day and night, and cannot be
persuaded that you don't hate him, since you neither write nor call.'

I closed the door, and rolled a stone to assist the loosened lock in
holding it; and spreading my umbrella, I drew my charge underneath: for
the rain began to drive through the moaning branches of the trees, and
warned us to avoid delay.  Our hurry prevented any comment on the
encounter with Heathcliff, as we stretched towards home; but I divined
instinctively that Catherine's heart was clouded now in double darkness.
Her features were so sad, they did not seem hers: she evidently regarded
what she had heard as every syllable true.

The master had retired to rest before we came in.  Cathy stole to his
room to inquire how he was; he had fallen asleep.  She returned, and
asked me to sit with her in the library.  We took our tea together; and
afterwards she lay down on the rug, and told me not to talk, for she was
weary.  I got a book, and pretended to read.  As soon as she supposed me
absorbed in my occupation, she recommenced her silent weeping: it
appeared, at present, her favourite diversion.  I suffered her to enjoy
it a while; then I expostulated: deriding and ridiculing all Mr.
Heathcliff's assertions about his son, as if I were certain she would
coincide.  Alas!  I hadn't skill to counteract the effect his account had
produced: it was just what he intended.

'You may be right, Ellen,' she answered; 'but I shall never feel at ease
till I know.  And I must tell Linton it is not my fault that I don't
write, and convince him that I shall not change.'

What use were anger and protestations against her silly credulity?  We
parted that night--hostile; but next day beheld me on the road to
Wuthering Heights, by the side of my wilful young mistress's pony.  I
couldn't bear to witness her sorrow: to see her pale, dejected
countenance, and heavy eyes: and I yielded, in the faint hope that Linton
himself might prove, by his reception of us, how little of the tale was
founded on fact.




CHAPTER XXIII


The rainy night had ushered in a misty morning--half frost, half
drizzle--and temporary brooks crossed our path--gurgling from the
uplands.  My feet were thoroughly wetted; I was cross and low; exactly
the humour suited for making the most of these disagreeable things.  We
entered the farm-house by the kitchen way, to ascertain whether Mr.
Heathcliff were really absent: because I put slight faith in his own
affirmation.

Joseph seemed sitting in a sort of elysium alone, beside a roaring fire;
a quart of ale on the table near him, bristling with large pieces of
toasted oat-cake; and his black, short pipe in his mouth.  Catherine ran
to the hearth to warm herself.  I asked if the master was in?  My
question remained so long unanswered, that I thought the old man had
grown deaf, and repeated it louder.

'Na--ay!' he snarled, or rather screamed through his nose.  'Na--ay! yah
muh goa back whear yah coom frough.'

'Joseph!' cried a peevish voice, simultaneously with me, from the inner
room.  'How often am I to call you?  There are only a few red ashes now.
Joseph! come this moment.'

Vigorous puffs, and a resolute stare into the grate, declared he had no
ear for this appeal.  The housekeeper and Hareton were invisible; one
gone on an errand, and the other at his work, probably.  We knew Linton's
tones, and entered.

'Oh, I hope you'll die in a garret, starved to death!' said the boy,
mistaking our approach for that of his negligent attendant.

He stopped on observing his error: his cousin flew to him.

'Is that you, Miss Linton?' he said, raising his head from the arm of the
great chair, in which he reclined.  'No--don't kiss me: it takes my
breath.  Dear me!  Papa said you would call,' continued he, after
recovering a little from Catherine's embrace; while she stood by looking
very contrite.  'Will you shut the door, if you please? you left it open;
and those--those _detestable_ creatures won't bring coals to the fire.
It's so cold!'

I stirred up the cinders, and fetched a scuttleful myself.  The invalid
complained of being covered with ashes; but he had a tiresome cough, and
looked feverish and ill, so I did not rebuke his temper.

'Well, Linton,' murmured Catherine, when his corrugated brow relaxed,
'are you glad to see me?  Can I do you any good?'

'Why didn't you come before?' he asked.  'You should have come, instead
of writing.  It tired me dreadfully writing those long letters.  I'd far
rather have talked to you.  Now, I can neither bear to talk, nor anything
else.  I wonder where Zillah is!  Will you' (looking at me) 'step into
the kitchen and see?'

I had received no thanks for my other service; and being unwilling to run
to and fro at his behest, I replied--'Nobody is out there but Joseph.'

'I want to drink,' he exclaimed fretfully, turning away.  'Zillah is
constantly gadding off to Gimmerton since papa went: it's miserable!  And
I'm obliged to come down here--they resolved never to hear me up-stairs.'

'Is your father attentive to you, Master Heathcliff?' I asked, perceiving
Catherine to be checked in her friendly advances.

'Attentive?  He makes them a little more attentive at least,' he cried.
'The wretches!  Do you know, Miss Linton, that brute Hareton laughs at
me!  I hate him! indeed, I hate them all: they are odious beings.'

Cathy began searching for some water; she lighted on a pitcher in the
dresser, filled a tumbler, and brought it.  He bid her add a spoonful of
wine from a bottle on the table; and having swallowed a small portion,
appeared more tranquil, and said she was very kind.

'And are you glad to see me?' asked she, reiterating her former question
and pleased to detect the faint dawn of a smile.

'Yes, I am.  It's something new to hear a voice like yours!' he replied.
'But I have been vexed, because you wouldn't come.  And papa swore it was
owing to me: he called me a pitiful, shuffling, worthless thing; and said
you despised me; and if he had been in my place, he would be more the
master of the Grange than your father by this time.  But you don't
despise me, do you, Miss--?'

'I wish you would say Catherine, or Cathy,' interrupted my young lady.
'Despise you?  No!  Next to papa and Ellen, I love you better than
anybody living.  I don't love Mr. Heathcliff, though; and I dare not come
when he returns: will he stay away many days?'

'Not many,' answered Linton; 'but he goes on to the moors frequently,
since the shooting season commenced; and you might spend an hour or two
with me in his absence.  Do say you will.  I think I should not be
peevish with you: you'd not provoke me, and you'd always be ready to help
me, wouldn't you?'

'Yes,' said Catherine, stroking his long soft hair: 'if I could only get
papa's consent, I'd spend half my time with you.  Pretty Linton!  I wish
you were my brother.'

'And then you would like me as well as your father?' observed he, more
cheerfully.  'But papa says you would love me better than him and all the
world, if you were my wife; so I'd rather you were that.'

'No, I should never love anybody better than papa,' she returned gravely.
'And people hate their wives, sometimes; but not their sisters and
brothers: and if you were the latter, you would live with us, and papa
would be as fond of you as he is of me.'

Linton denied that people ever hated their wives; but Cathy affirmed they
did, and, in her wisdom, instanced his own father's aversion to her aunt.
I endeavoured to stop her thoughtless tongue.  I couldn't succeed till
everything she knew was out.  Master Heathcliff, much irritated, asserted
her relation was false.

'Papa told me; and papa does not tell falsehoods,' she answered pertly.

'_My_ papa scorns yours!' cried Linton.  'He calls him a sneaking fool.'

'Yours is a wicked man,' retorted Catherine; 'and you are very naughty to
dare to repeat what he says.  He must be wicked to have made Aunt
Isabella leave him as she did.'

'She didn't leave him,' said the boy; 'you sha'n't contradict me.'

'She did,' cried my young lady.

'Well, I'll tell you something!' said Linton.  'Your mother hated your
father: now then.'

'Oh!' exclaimed Catherine, too enraged to continue.

'And she loved mine,' added he.

'You little liar!  I hate you now!' she panted, and her face grew red
with passion.

'She did! she did!' sang Linton, sinking into the recess of his chair,
and leaning back his head to enjoy the agitation of the other disputant,
who stood behind.

'Hush, Master Heathcliff!' I said; 'that's your father's tale, too, I
suppose.'

'It isn't: you hold your tongue!' he answered.  'She did, she did,
Catherine! she did, she did!'

Cathy, beside herself, gave the chair a violent push, and caused him to
fall against one arm.  He was immediately seized by a suffocating cough
that soon ended his triumph.  It lasted so long that it frightened even
me.  As to his cousin, she wept with all her might, aghast at the
mischief she had done: though she said nothing.  I held him till the fit
exhausted itself.  Then he thrust me away, and leant his head down
silently.  Catherine quelled her lamentations also, took a seat opposite,
and looked solemnly into the fire.

'How do you feel now, Master Heathcliff?' I inquired, after waiting ten
minutes.

'I wish _she_ felt as I do,' he replied: 'spiteful, cruel thing! Hareton
never touches me: he never struck me in his life. And I was better
to-day: and there--' his voice died in a whimper.

'_I_ didn't strike you!' muttered Cathy, chewing her lip to prevent
another burst of emotion.

He sighed and moaned like one under great suffering, and kept it up for a
quarter of an hour; on purpose to distress his cousin apparently, for
whenever he caught a stifled sob from her he put renewed pain and pathos
into the inflexions of his voice.

'I'm sorry I hurt you, Linton,' she said at length, racked beyond
endurance.  'But I couldn't have been hurt by that little push, and I had
no idea that you could, either: you're not much, are you, Linton?  Don't
let me go home thinking I've done you harm.  Answer! speak to me.'

'I can't speak to you,' he murmured; 'you've hurt me so that I shall lie
awake all night choking with this cough.  If you had it you'd know what
it was; but _you'll_ be comfortably asleep while I'm in agony, and nobody
near me.  I wonder how you would like to pass those fearful nights!'  And
he began to wail aloud, for very pity of himself.

'Since you are in the habit of passing dreadful nights,' I said, 'it
won't be Miss who spoils your ease: you'd be the same had she never come.
However, she shall not disturb you again; and perhaps you'll get quieter
when we leave you.'

'Must I go?' asked Catherine dolefully, bending over him.  'Do you want
me to go, Linton?'

'You can't alter what you've done,' he replied pettishly, shrinking from
her, 'unless you alter it for the worse by teasing me into a fever.'

'Well, then, I must go?' she repeated.

'Let me alone, at least,' said he; 'I can't bear your talking.'

She lingered, and resisted my persuasions to departure a tiresome while;
but as he neither looked up nor spoke, she finally made a movement to the
door, and I followed.  We were recalled by a scream.  Linton had slid
from his seat on to the hearthstone, and lay writhing in the mere
perverseness of an indulged plague of a child, determined to be as
grievous and harassing as it can.  I thoroughly gauged his disposition
from his behaviour, and saw at once it would be folly to attempt
humouring him.  Not so my companion: she ran back in terror, knelt down,
and cried, and soothed, and entreated, till he grew quiet from lack of
breath: by no means from compunction at distressing her.

'I shall lift him on to the settle,' I said, 'and he may roll about as he
pleases: we can't stop to watch him.  I hope you are satisfied, Miss
Cathy, that you are not the person to benefit him; and that his condition
of health is not occasioned by attachment to you.  Now, then, there he
is!  Come away: as soon as he knows there is nobody by to care for his
nonsense, he'll be glad to lie still.'

She placed a cushion under his head, and offered him some water; he
rejected the latter, and tossed uneasily on the former, as if it were a
stone or a block of wood.  She tried to put it more comfortably.

'I can't do with that,' he said; 'it's not high enough.'

Catherine brought another to lay above it.

'That's too high,' murmured the provoking thing.

'How must I arrange it, then?' she asked despairingly.

He twined himself up to her, as she half knelt by the settle, and
converted her shoulder into a support.

'No, that won't do,' I said.  'You'll be content with the cushion, Master
Heathcliff.  Miss has wasted too much time on you already: we cannot
remain five minutes longer.'

'Yes, yes, we can!' replied Cathy.  'He's good and patient now.  He's
beginning to think I shall have far greater misery than he will to-night,
if I believe he is the worse for my visit: and then I dare not come
again.  Tell the truth about it, Linton; for I musn't come, if I have
hurt you.'

'You must come, to cure me,' he answered.  'You ought to come, because
you have hurt me: you know you have extremely!  I was not as ill when you
entered as I am at present--was I?'

'But you've made yourself ill by crying and being in a passion.--I didn't
do it all,' said his cousin.  'However, we'll be friends now.  And you
want me: you would wish to see me sometimes, really?'

'I told you I did,' he replied impatiently.  'Sit on the settle and let
me lean on your knee.  That's as mamma used to do, whole afternoons
together.  Sit quite still and don't talk: but you may sing a song, if
you can sing; or you may say a nice long interesting ballad--one of those
you promised to teach me; or a story.  I'd rather have a ballad, though:
begin.'

Catherine repeated the longest she could remember.  The employment
pleased both mightily.  Linton would have another, and after that
another, notwithstanding my strenuous objections; and so they went on
until the clock struck twelve, and we heard Hareton in the court,
returning for his dinner.

'And to-morrow, Catherine, will you be here to-morrow?' asked young
Heathcliff, holding her frock as she rose reluctantly.

'No,' I answered, 'nor next day neither.'  She, however, gave a different
response evidently, for his forehead cleared as she stooped and whispered
in his ear.

'You won't go to-morrow, recollect, Miss!' I commenced, when we were out
of the house.  'You are not dreaming of it, are you?'

She smiled.

'Oh, I'll take good care,' I continued: 'I'll have that lock mended, and
you can escape by no way else.'

'I can get over the wall,' she said laughing.  'The Grange is not a
prison, Ellen, and you are not my gaoler.  And besides, I'm almost
seventeen: I'm a woman.  And I'm certain Linton would recover quickly if
he had me to look after him.  I'm older than he is, you know, and wiser:
less childish, am I not?  And he'll soon do as I direct him, with some
slight coaxing.  He's a pretty little darling when he's good.  I'd make
such a pet of him, if he were mine.  We should never quarrel, should we
after we were used to each other?  Don't you like him, Ellen?'

'Like him!' I exclaimed.  'The worst-tempered bit of a sickly slip that
ever struggled into its teens.  Happily, as Mr. Heathcliff conjectured,
he'll not win twenty.  I doubt whether he'll see spring, indeed.  And
small loss to his family whenever he drops off.  And lucky it is for us
that his father took him: the kinder he was treated, the more tedious and
selfish he'd be.  I'm glad you have no chance of having him for a
husband, Miss Catherine.'

My companion waxed serious at hearing this speech.  To speak of his death
so regardlessly wounded her feelings.

'He's younger than I,' she answered, after a protracted pause of
meditation, 'and he ought to live the longest: he will--he must live as
long as I do.  He's as strong now as when he first came into the north;
I'm positive of that.  It's only a cold that ails him, the same as papa
has.  You say papa will get better, and why shouldn't he?'

'Well, well,' I cried, 'after all, we needn't trouble ourselves; for
listen, Miss,--and mind, I'll keep my word,--if you attempt going to
Wuthering Heights again, with or without me, I shall inform Mr. Linton,
and, unless he allow it, the intimacy with your cousin must not be
revived.'

'It has been revived,' muttered Cathy, sulkily.

'Must not be continued, then,' I said.

'We'll see,' was her reply, and she set off at a gallop, leaving me to
toil in the rear.

We both reached home before our dinner-time; my master supposed we had
been wandering through the park, and therefore he demanded no explanation
of our absence.  As soon as I entered I hastened to change my soaked
shoes and stockings; but sitting such awhile at the Heights had done the
mischief.  On the succeeding morning I was laid up, and during three
weeks I remained incapacitated for attending to my duties: a calamity
never experienced prior to that period, and never, I am thankful to say,
since.

My little mistress behaved like an angel in coming to wait on me, and
cheer my solitude; the confinement brought me exceedingly low.  It is
wearisome, to a stirring active body: but few have slighter reasons for
complaint than I had.  The moment Catherine left Mr. Linton's room she
appeared at my bedside.  Her day was divided between us; no amusement
usurped a minute: she neglected her meals, her studies, and her play; and
she was the fondest nurse that ever watched.  She must have had a warm
heart, when she loved her father so, to give so much to me.  I said her
days were divided between us; but the master retired early, and I
generally needed nothing after six o'clock, thus the evening was her own.
Poor thing!  I never considered what she did with herself after tea.  And
though frequently, when she looked in to bid me good-night, I remarked a
fresh colour in her cheeks and a pinkness over her slender fingers,
instead of fancying the line borrowed from a cold ride across the moors,
I laid it to the charge of a hot fire in the library.




CHAPTER XXIV


At the close of three weeks I was able to quit my chamber and move about
the house.  And on the first occasion of my sitting up in the evening I
asked Catherine to read to me, because my eyes were weak.  We were in the
library, the master having gone to bed: she consented, rather
unwillingly, I fancied; and imagining my sort of books did not suit her,
I bid her please herself in the choice of what she perused.  She selected
one of her own favourites, and got forward steadily about an hour; then
came frequent questions.

'Ellen, are not you tired?  Hadn't you better lie down now?  You'll be
sick, keeping up so long, Ellen.'

'No, no, dear, I'm not tired,' I returned, continually.

Perceiving me immovable, she essayed another method of showing her
disrelish for her occupation.  It changed to yawning, and stretching,
and--

'Ellen, I'm tired.'

'Give over then and talk,' I answered.

That was worse: she fretted and sighed, and looked at her watch till
eight, and finally went to her room, completely overdone with sleep;
judging by her peevish, heavy look, and the constant rubbing she
inflicted on her eyes.  The following night she seemed more impatient
still; and on the third from recovering my company she complained of a
headache, and left me.  I thought her conduct odd; and having remained
alone a long while, I resolved on going and inquiring whether she were
better, and asking her to come and lie on the sofa, instead of up-stairs
in the dark.  No Catherine could I discover up-stairs, and none below.
The servants affirmed they had not seen her.  I listened at Mr. Edgar's
door; all was silence.  I returned to her apartment, extinguished my
candle, and seated myself in the window.

The moon shone bright; a sprinkling of snow covered the ground, and I
reflected that she might, possibly, have taken it into her head to walk
about the garden, for refreshment.  I did detect a figure creeping along
the inner fence of the park; but it was not my young mistress: on its
emerging into the light, I recognised one of the grooms.  He stood a
considerable period, viewing the carriage-road through the grounds; then
started off at a brisk pace, as if he had detected something, and
reappeared presently, leading Miss's pony; and there she was, just
dismounted, and walking by its side.  The man took his charge stealthily
across the grass towards the stable.  Cathy entered by the
casement-window of the drawing-room, and glided noiselessly up to where I
awaited her.  She put the door gently too, slipped off her snowy shoes,
untied her hat, and was proceeding, unconscious of my espionage, to lay
aside her mantle, when I suddenly rose and revealed myself.  The surprise
petrified her an instant: she uttered an inarticulate exclamation, and
stood fixed.

'My dear Miss Catherine,' I began, too vividly impressed by her recent
kindness to break into a scold, 'where have you been riding out at this
hour?  And why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale?  Where
have you been?  Speak!'

'To the bottom of the park,' she stammered.  'I didn't tell a tale.'

'And nowhere else?' I demanded.

'No,' was the muttered reply.

'Oh, Catherine!' I cried, sorrowfully.  'You know you have been doing
wrong, or you wouldn't be driven to uttering an untruth to me.  That does
grieve me.  I'd rather be three months ill, than hear you frame a
deliberate lie.'

She sprang forward, and bursting into tears, threw her arms round my
neck.

'Well, Ellen, I'm so afraid of you being angry,' she said.  'Promise not
to be angry, and you shall know the very truth: I hate to hide it.'

We sat down in the window-seat; I assured her I would not scold, whatever
her secret might be, and I guessed it, of course; so she commenced--

'I've been to Wuthering Heights, Ellen, and I've never missed going a day
since you fell ill; except thrice before, and twice after you left your
room.  I gave Michael books and pictures to prepare Minny every evening,
and to put her back in the stable: you mustn't scold him either, mind.  I
was at the Heights by half-past six, and generally stayed till half-past
eight, and then galloped home.  It was not to amuse myself that I went: I
was often wretched all the time.  Now and then I was happy: once in a
week perhaps.  At first, I expected there would be sad work persuading
you to let me keep my word to Linton: for I had engaged to call again
next day, when we quitted him; but, as you stayed up-stairs on the
morrow, I escaped that trouble.  While Michael was refastening the lock
of the park door in the afternoon, I got possession of the key, and told
him how my cousin wished me to visit him, because he was sick, and
couldn't come to the Grange; and how papa would object to my going: and
then I negotiated with him about the pony.  He is fond of reading, and he
thinks of leaving soon to get married; so he offered, if I would lend him
books out of the library, to do what I wished: but I preferred giving him
my own, and that satisfied him better.

'On my second visit Linton seemed in lively spirits; and Zillah (that is
their housekeeper) made us a clean room and a good fire, and told us
that, as Joseph was out at a prayer-meeting and Hareton Earnshaw was off
with his dogs--robbing our woods of pheasants, as I heard afterwards--we
might do what we liked.  She brought me some warm wine and gingerbread,
and appeared exceedingly good-natured, and Linton sat in the arm-chair,
and I in the little rocking chair on the hearth-stone, and we laughed and
talked so merrily, and found so much to say: we planned where we would
go, and what we would do in summer.  I needn't repeat that, because you
would call it silly.

'One time, however, we were near quarrelling.  He said the pleasantest
manner of spending a hot July day was lying from morning till evening on
a bank of heath in the middle of the moors, with the bees humming
dreamily about among the bloom, and the larks singing high up overhead,
and the blue sky and bright sun shining steadily and cloudlessly.  That
was his most perfect idea of heaven's happiness: mine was rocking in a
rustling green tree, with a west wind blowing, and bright white clouds
flitting rapidly above; and not only larks, but throstles, and
blackbirds, and linnets, and cuckoos pouring out music on every side, and
the moors seen at a distance, broken into cool dusky dells; but close by
great swells of long grass undulating in waves to the breeze; and woods
and sounding water, and the whole world awake and wild with joy.  He
wanted all to lie in an ecstasy of peace; I wanted all to sparkle and
dance in a glorious jubilee.  I said his heaven would be only half alive;
and he said mine would be drunk: I said I should fall asleep in his; and
he said he could not breathe in mine, and began to grow very snappish.  At
last, we agreed to try both, as soon as the right weather came; and then
we kissed each other and were friends.

'After sitting still an hour, I looked at the great room with its smooth
uncarpeted floor, and thought how nice it would be to play in, if we
removed the table; and I asked Linton to call Zillah in to help us, and
we'd have a game at blindman's-buff; she should try to catch us: you used
to, you know, Ellen.  He wouldn't: there was no pleasure in it, he said;
but he consented to play at ball with me.  We found two in a cupboard,
among a heap of old toys, tops, and hoops, and battledores and
shuttlecocks.  One was marked C., and the other H.; I wished to have the
C., because that stood for Catherine, and the H. might be for Heathcliff,
his name; but the bran came out of H., and Linton didn't like it.  I beat
him constantly: and he got cross again, and coughed, and returned to his
chair.  That night, though, he easily recovered his good humour: he was
charmed with two or three pretty songs--_your_ songs, Ellen; and when I
was obliged to go, he begged and entreated me to come the following
evening; and I promised.  Minny and I went flying home as light as air;
and I dreamt of Wuthering Heights and my sweet, darling cousin, till
morning.

'On the morrow I was sad; partly because you were poorly, and partly that
I wished my father knew, and approved of my excursions: but it was
beautiful moonlight after tea; and, as I rode on, the gloom cleared.  I
shall have another happy evening, I thought to myself; and what delights
me more, my pretty Linton will.  I trotted up their garden, and was
turning round to the back, when that fellow Earnshaw met me, took my
bridle, and bid me go in by the front entrance.  He patted Minny's neck,
and said she was a bonny beast, and appeared as if he wanted me to speak
to him.  I only told him to leave my horse alone, or else it would kick
him.  He answered in his vulgar accent, "It wouldn't do mitch hurt if it
did;" and surveyed its legs with a smile.  I was half inclined to make it
try; however, he moved off to open the door, and, as he raised the latch,
he looked up to the inscription above, and said, with a stupid mixture of
awkwardness and elation: "Miss Catherine!  I can read yon, now."

'"Wonderful," I exclaimed.  "Pray let us hear you--you _are_ grown
clever!"

'He spelt, and drawled over by syllables, the name--"Hareton Earnshaw."

'"And the figures?" I cried, encouragingly, perceiving that he came to a
dead halt.

'"I cannot tell them yet," he answered.

'"Oh, you dunce!" I said, laughing heartily at his failure.

'The fool stared, with a grin hovering about his lips, and a scowl
gathering over his eyes, as if uncertain whether he might not join in my
mirth: whether it were not pleasant familiarity, or what it really was,
contempt.  I settled his doubts, by suddenly retrieving my gravity and
desiring him to walk away, for I came to see Linton, not him.  He
reddened--I saw that by the moonlight--dropped his hand from the latch,
and skulked off, a picture of mortified vanity.  He imagined himself to
be as accomplished as Linton, I suppose, because he could spell his own
name; and was marvellously discomfited that I didn't think the same.'

'Stop, Miss Catherine, dear!'--I interrupted.  'I shall not scold, but I
don't like your conduct there.  If you had remembered that Hareton was
your cousin as much as Master Heathcliff, you would have felt how
improper it was to behave in that way.  At least, it was praiseworthy
ambition for him to desire to be as accomplished as Linton; and probably
he did not learn merely to show off: you had made him ashamed of his
ignorance before, I have no doubt; and he wished to remedy it and please
you.  To sneer at his imperfect attempt was very bad breeding.  Had you
been brought up in his circumstances, would you be less rude?  He was as
quick and as intelligent a child as ever you were; and I'm hurt that he
should be despised now, because that base Heathcliff has treated him so
unjustly.'

'Well, Ellen, you won't cry about it, will you?' she exclaimed, surprised
at my earnestness.  'But wait, and you shall hear if he conned his A B C
to please me; and if it were worth while being civil to the brute.  I
entered; Linton was lying on the settle, and half got up to welcome me.

'"I'm ill to-night, Catherine, love," he said; "and you must have all the
talk, and let me listen.  Come, and sit by me.  I was sure you wouldn't
break your word, and I'll make you promise again, before you go."

'I knew now that I mustn't tease him, as he was ill; and I spoke softly
and put no questions, and avoided irritating him in any way.  I had
brought some of my nicest books for him: he asked me to read a little of
one, and I was about to comply, when Earnshaw burst the door open: having
gathered venom with reflection.  He advanced direct to us, seized Linton
by the arm, and swung him off the seat.

'"Get to thy own room!" he said, in a voice almost inarticulate with
passion; and his face looked swelled and furious.  "Take her there if she
comes to see thee: thou shalln't keep me out of this.  Begone wi' ye
both!"

'He swore at us, and left Linton no time to answer, nearly throwing him
into the kitchen; and he clenched his fist as I followed, seemingly
longing to knock me down.  I was afraid for a moment, and I let one
volume fall; he kicked it after me, and shut us out.  I heard a
malignant, crackly laugh by the fire, and turning, beheld that odious
Joseph standing rubbing his bony hands, and quivering.

'"I wer sure he'd sarve ye out!  He's a grand lad!  He's getten t' raight
sperrit in him!  _He_ knaws--ay, he knaws, as weel as I do, who sud be t'
maister yonder--Ech, ech, ech!  He made ye skift properly!  Ech, ech,
ech!"

'"Where must we go?" I asked of my cousin, disregarding the old wretch's
mockery.

'Linton was white and trembling.  He was not pretty then, Ellen: oh, no!
he looked frightful; for his thin face and large eyes were wrought into
an expression of frantic, powerless fury.  He grasped the handle of the
door, and shook it: it was fastened inside.

'"If you don't let me in, I'll kill you!--If you don't let me in, I'll
kill you!" he rather shrieked than said.  "Devil! devil!--I'll kill
you--I'll kill you!"

Joseph uttered his croaking laugh again.

'"Thear, that's t' father!" he cried.  "That's father!  We've allas
summut o' either side in us.  Niver heed, Hareton, lad--dunnut be
'feard--he cannot get at thee!"

'I took hold of Linton's hands, and tried to pull him away; but he
shrieked so shockingly that I dared not proceed.  At last his cries were
choked by a dreadful fit of coughing; blood gushed from his mouth, and he
fell on the ground.  I ran into the yard, sick with terror; and called
for Zillah, as loud as I could.  She soon heard me: she was milking the
cows in a shed behind the barn, and hurrying from her work, she inquired
what there was to do?  I hadn't breath to explain; dragging her in, I
looked about for Linton.  Earnshaw had come out to examine the mischief
he had caused, and he was then conveying the poor thing up-stairs.  Zillah
and I ascended after him; but he stopped me at the top of the steps, and
said I shouldn't go in: I must go home.  I exclaimed that he had killed
Linton, and I _would_ enter.  Joseph locked the door, and declared I
should do "no sich stuff," and asked me whether I were "bahn to be as mad
as him."  I stood crying till the housekeeper reappeared.  She affirmed
he would be better in a bit, but he couldn't do with that shrieking and
din; and she took me, and nearly carried me into the house.

'Ellen, I was ready to tear my hair off my head!  I sobbed and wept so
that my eyes were almost blind; and the ruffian you have such sympathy
with stood opposite: presuming every now and then to bid me "wisht," and
denying that it was his fault; and, finally, frightened by my assertions
that I would tell papa, and that he should be put in prison and hanged,
he commenced blubbering himself, and hurried out to hide his cowardly
agitation.  Still, I was not rid of him: when at length they compelled me
to depart, and I had got some hundred yards off the premises, he suddenly
issued from the shadow of the road-side, and checked Minny and took hold
of me.

'"Miss Catherine, I'm ill grieved," he began, "but it's rayther too bad--"

'I gave him a cut with my whip, thinking perhaps he would murder me.  He
let go, thundering one of his horrid curses, and I galloped home more
than half out of my senses.

'I didn't bid you good-night that evening, and I didn't go to Wuthering
Heights the next: I wished to go exceedingly; but I was strangely
excited, and dreaded to hear that Linton was dead, sometimes; and
sometimes shuddered at the thought of encountering Hareton.  On the third
day I took courage: at least, I couldn't bear longer suspense, and stole
off once more.  I went at five o'clock, and walked; fancying I might
manage to creep into the house, and up to Linton's room, unobserved.
However, the dogs gave notice of my approach.  Zillah received me, and
saying "the lad was mending nicely," showed me into a small, tidy,
carpeted apartment, where, to my inexpressible joy, I beheld Linton laid
on a little sofa, reading one of my books.  But he would neither speak to
me nor look at me, through a whole hour, Ellen: he has such an unhappy
temper.  And what quite confounded me, when he did open his mouth, it was
to utter the falsehood that I had occasioned the uproar, and Hareton was
not to blame!  Unable to reply, except passionately, I got up and walked
from the room.  He sent after me a faint "Catherine!"  He did not reckon
on being answered so: but I wouldn't turn back; and the morrow was the
second day on which I stayed at home, nearly determined to visit him no
more.  But it was so miserable going to bed and getting up, and never
hearing anything about him, that my resolution melted into air before it
was properly formed.  It had appeared wrong to take the journey once; now
it seemed wrong to refrain.  Michael came to ask if he must saddle Minny;
I said "Yes," and considered myself doing a duty as she bore me over the
hills.  I was forced to pass the front windows to get to the court: it
was no use trying to conceal my presence.

'"Young master is in the house," said Zillah, as she saw me making for
the parlour.  I went in; Earnshaw was there also, but he quitted the room
directly.  Linton sat in the great arm-chair half asleep; walking up to
the fire, I began in a serious tone, partly meaning it to be true--

'"As you don't like me, Linton, and as you think I come on purpose to
hurt you, and pretend that I do so every time, this is our last meeting:
let us say good-bye; and tell Mr. Heathcliff that you have no wish to see
me, and that he mustn't invent any more falsehoods on the subject."

'"Sit down and take your hat off, Catherine," he answered.  "You are so
much happier than I am, you ought to be better.  Papa talks enough of my
defects, and shows enough scorn of me, to make it natural I should doubt
myself.  I doubt whether I am not altogether as worthless as he calls me,
frequently; and then I feel so cross and bitter, I hate everybody!  I am
worthless, and bad in temper, and bad in spirit, almost always; and, if
you choose, you may say good-bye: you'll get rid of an annoyance.  Only,
Catherine, do me this justice: believe that if I might be as sweet, and
as kind, and as good as you are, I would be; as willingly, and more so,
than as happy and as healthy.  And believe that your kindness has made me
love you deeper than if I deserved your love: and though I couldn't, and
cannot help showing my nature to you, I regret it and repent it; and
shall regret and repent it till I die!"

'I felt he spoke the truth; and I felt I must forgive him: and, though we
should quarrel the next moment, I must forgive him again.  We were
reconciled; but we cried, both of us, the whole time I stayed: not
entirely for sorrow; yet I _was_ sorry Linton had that distorted nature.
He'll never let his friends be at ease, and he'll never be at ease
himself!  I have always gone to his little parlour, since that night;
because his father returned the day after.

'About three times, I think, we have been merry and hopeful, as we were
the first evening; the rest of my visits were dreary and troubled: now
with his selfishness and spite, and now with his sufferings: but I've
learned to endure the former with nearly as little resentment as the
latter.  Mr. Heathcliff purposely avoids me: I have hardly seen him at
all.  Last Sunday, indeed, coming earlier than usual, I heard him abusing
poor Linton cruelly for his conduct of the night before.  I can't tell
how he knew of it, unless he listened.  Linton had certainly behaved
provokingly: however, it was the business of nobody but me, and I
interrupted Mr. Heathcliff's lecture by entering and telling him so.  He
burst into a laugh, and went away, saying he was glad I took that view of
the matter.  Since then, I've told Linton he must whisper his bitter
things.  Now, Ellen, you have heard all.  I can't be prevented from going
to Wuthering Heights, except by inflicting misery on two people; whereas,
if you'll only not tell papa, my going need disturb the tranquillity of
none.  You'll not tell, will you?  It will be very heartless, if you do.'

'I'll make up my mind on that point by to-morrow, Miss Catherine,' I
replied.  'It requires some study; and so I'll leave you to your rest,
and go think it over.'

I thought it over aloud, in my master's presence; walking straight from
her room to his, and relating the whole story: with the exception of her
conversations with her cousin, and any mention of Hareton.  Mr. Linton
was alarmed and distressed, more than he would acknowledge to me.  In the
morning, Catherine learnt my betrayal of her confidence, and she learnt
also that her secret visits were to end.  In vain she wept and writhed
against the interdict, and implored her father to have pity on Linton:
all she got to comfort her was a promise that he would write and give him
leave to come to the Grange when he pleased; but explaining that he must
no longer expect to see Catherine at Wuthering Heights.  Perhaps, had he
been aware of his nephew's disposition and state of health, he would have
seen fit to withhold even that slight consolation.




CHAPTER XXV


'These things happened last winter, sir,' said Mrs. Dean; 'hardly more
than a year ago.  Last winter, I did not think, at another twelve months'
end, I should be amusing a stranger to the family with relating them!
Yet, who knows how long you'll be a stranger?  You're too young to rest
always contented, living by yourself; and I some way fancy no one could
see Catherine Linton and not love her.  You smile; but why do you look so
lively and interested when I talk about her? and why have you asked me to
hang her picture over your fireplace? and why--?'

'Stop, my good friend!' I cried.  'It may be very possible that _I_
should love her; but would she love me?  I doubt it too much to venture
my tranquillity by running into temptation: and then my home is not here.
I'm of the busy world, and to its arms I must return.  Go on.  Was
Catherine obedient to her father's commands?'

'She was,' continued the housekeeper.  'Her affection for him was still
the chief sentiment in her heart; and he spoke without anger: he spoke in
the deep tenderness of one about to leave his treasure amid perils and
foes, where his remembered words would be the only aid that he could
bequeath to guide her.  He said to me, a few days afterwards, "I wish my
nephew would write, Ellen, or call.  Tell me, sincerely, what you think
of him: is he changed for the better, or is there a prospect of
improvement, as he grows a man?"

'"He's very delicate, sir," I replied; "and scarcely likely to reach
manhood: but this I can say, he does not resemble his father; and if Miss
Catherine had the misfortune to marry him, he would not be beyond her
control: unless she were extremely and foolishly indulgent.  However,
master, you'll have plenty of time to get acquainted with him and see
whether he would suit her: it wants four years and more to his being of
age."'

Edgar sighed; and, walking to the window, looked out towards Gimmerton
Kirk. It was a misty afternoon, but the February sun shone dimly, and we
could just distinguish the two fir-trees in the yard, and the
sparely-scattered gravestones.

'I've prayed often,' he half soliloquised, 'for the approach of what is
coming; and now I begin to shrink, and fear it.  I thought the memory of
the hour I came down that glen a bridegroom would be less sweet than the
anticipation that I was soon, in a few months, or, possibly, weeks, to be
carried up, and laid in its lonely hollow!  Ellen, I've been very happy
with my little Cathy: through winter nights and summer days she was a
living hope at my side.  But I've been as happy musing by myself among
those stones, under that old church: lying, through the long June
evenings, on the green mound of her mother's grave, and wishing--yearning
for the time when I might lie beneath it.  What can I do for Cathy?  How
must I quit her?  I'd not care one moment for Linton being Heathcliff's
son; nor for his taking her from me, if he could console her for my loss.
I'd not care that Heathcliff gained his ends, and triumphed in robbing me
of my last blessing!  But should Linton be unworthy--only a feeble tool
to his father--I cannot abandon her to him!  And, hard though it be to
crush her buoyant spirit, I must persevere in making her sad while I
live, and leaving her solitary when I die.  Darling!  I'd rather resign
her to God, and lay her in the earth before me.'

'Resign her to God as it is, sir,' I answered, 'and if we should lose
you--which may He forbid--under His providence, I'll stand her friend and
counsellor to the last.  Miss Catherine is a good girl: I don't fear that
she will go wilfully wrong; and people who do their duty are always
finally rewarded.'

Spring advanced; yet my master gathered no real strength, though he
resumed his walks in the grounds with his daughter.  To her inexperienced
notions, this itself was a sign of convalescence; and then his cheek was
often flushed, and his eyes were bright; she felt sure of his recovering.
On her seventeenth birthday, he did not visit the churchyard: it was
raining, and I observed--'You'll surely not go out to-night, sir?'

He answered,--'No, I'll defer it this year a little longer.'  He wrote
again to Linton, expressing his great desire to see him; and, had the
invalid been presentable, I've no doubt his father would have permitted
him to come.  As it was, being instructed, he returned an answer,
intimating that Mr. Heathcliff objected to his calling at the Grange; but
his uncle's kind remembrance delighted him, and he hoped to meet him
sometimes in his rambles, and personally to petition that his cousin and
he might not remain long so utterly divided.

That part of his letter was simple, and probably his own.  Heathcliff
knew he could plead eloquently for Catherine's company, then.

'I do not ask,' he said, 'that she may visit here; but am I never to see
her, because my father forbids me to go to her home, and you forbid her
to come to mine?  Do, now and then, ride with her towards the Heights;
and let us exchange a few words, in your presence!  We have done nothing
to deserve this separation; and you are not angry with me: you have no
reason to dislike me, you allow, yourself.  Dear uncle! send me a kind
note to-morrow, and leave to join you anywhere you please, except at
Thrushcross Grange.  I believe an interview would convince you that my
father's character is not mine: he affirms I am more your nephew than his
son; and though I have faults which render me unworthy of Catherine, she
has excused them, and for her sake, you should also.  You inquire after
my health--it is better; but while I remain cut off from all hope, and
doomed to solitude, or the society of those who never did and never will
like me, how can I be cheerful and well?'

Edgar, though he felt for the boy, could not consent to grant his
request; because he could not accompany Catherine.  He said, in summer,
perhaps, they might meet: meantime, he wished him to continue writing at
intervals, and engaged to give him what advice and comfort he was able by
letter; being well aware of his hard position in his family.  Linton
complied; and had he been unrestrained, would probably have spoiled all
by filling his epistles with complaints and lamentations: but his father
kept a sharp watch over him; and, of course, insisted on every line that
my master sent being shown; so, instead of penning his peculiar personal
sufferings and distresses, the themes constantly uppermost in his
thoughts, he harped on the cruel obligation of being held asunder from
his friend and love; and gently intimated that Mr. Linton must allow an
interview soon, or he should fear he was purposely deceiving him with
empty promises.

Cathy was a powerful ally at home; and between them they at length
persuaded my master to acquiesce in their having a ride or a walk
together about once a week, under my guardianship, and on the moors
nearest the Grange: for June found him still declining.  Though he had
set aside yearly a portion of his income for my young lady's fortune, he
had a natural desire that she might retain--or at least return in a short
time to--the house of her ancestors; and he considered her only prospect
of doing that was by a union with his heir; he had no idea that the
latter was failing almost as fast as himself; nor had any one, I believe:
no doctor visited the Heights, and no one saw Master Heathcliff to make
report of his condition among us.  I, for my part, began to fancy my
forebodings were false, and that he must be actually rallying, when he
mentioned riding and walking on the moors, and seemed so earnest in
pursuing his object.  I could not picture a father treating a dying child
as tyrannically and wickedly as I afterwards learned Heathcliff had
treated him, to compel this apparent eagerness: his efforts redoubling
the more imminently his avaricious and unfeeling plans were threatened
with defeat by death.




CHAPTER XXVI


Summer was already past its prime, when Edgar reluctantly yielded his
assent to their entreaties, and Catherine and I set out on our first ride
to join her cousin.  It was a close, sultry day: devoid of sunshine, but
with a sky too dappled and hazy to threaten rain: and our place of
meeting had been fixed at the guide-stone, by the cross-roads.  On
arriving there, however, a little herd-boy, despatched as a messenger,
told us that,--'Maister Linton wer just o' this side th' Heights: and
he'd be mitch obleeged to us to gang on a bit further.'

'Then Master Linton has forgot the first injunction of his uncle,' I
observed: 'he bid us keep on the Grange land, and here we are off at
once.'

'Well, we'll turn our horses' heads round when we reach him,' answered my
companion; 'our excursion shall lie towards home.'

But when we reached him, and that was scarcely a quarter of a mile from
his own door, we found he had no horse; and we were forced to dismount,
and leave ours to graze.  He lay on the heath, awaiting our approach, and
did not rise till we came within a few yards.  Then he walked so feebly,
and looked so pale, that I immediately exclaimed,--'Why, Master
Heathcliff, you are not fit for enjoying a ramble this morning.  How ill
you do look!'

Catherine surveyed him with grief and astonishment: she changed the
ejaculation of joy on her lips to one of alarm; and the congratulation on
their long-postponed meeting to an anxious inquiry, whether he were worse
than usual?

'No--better--better!' he panted, trembling, and retaining her hand as if
he needed its support, while his large blue eyes wandered timidly over
her; the hollowness round them transforming to haggard wildness the
languid expression they once possessed.

'But you have been worse,' persisted his cousin; 'worse than when I saw
you last; you are thinner, and--'

'I'm tired,' he interrupted, hurriedly.  'It is too hot for walking, let
us rest here.  And, in the morning, I often feel sick--papa says I grow
so fast.'

Badly satisfied, Cathy sat down, and he reclined beside her.

'This is something like your paradise,' said she, making an effort at
cheerfulness.  'You recollect the two days we agreed to spend in the
place and way each thought pleasantest?  This is nearly yours, only there
are clouds; but then they are so soft and mellow: it is nicer than
sunshine.  Next week, if you can, we'll ride down to the Grange Park, and
try mine.'

Linton did not appear to remember what she talked of and he had evidently
great difficulty in sustaining any kind of conversation.  His lack of
interest in the subjects she started, and his equal incapacity to
contribute to her entertainment, were so obvious that she could not
conceal her disappointment.  An indefinite alteration had come over his
whole person and manner.  The pettishness that might be caressed into
fondness, had yielded to a listless apathy; there was less of the peevish
temper of a child which frets and teases on purpose to be soothed, and
more of the self-absorbed moroseness of a confirmed invalid, repelling
consolation, and ready to regard the good-humoured mirth of others as an
insult.  Catherine perceived, as well as I did, that he held it rather a
punishment, than a gratification, to endure our company; and she made no
scruple of proposing, presently, to depart.  That proposal, unexpectedly,
roused Linton from his lethargy, and threw him into a strange state of
agitation.  He glanced fearfully towards the Heights, begging she would
remain another half-hour, at least.

'But I think,' said Cathy, 'you'd be more comfortable at home than
sitting here; and I cannot amuse you to-day, I see, by my tales, and
songs, and chatter: you have grown wiser than I, in these six months; you
have little taste for my diversions now: or else, if I could amuse you,
I'd willingly stay.'

'Stay to rest yourself,' he replied.  'And, Catherine, don't think or say
that I'm _very_ unwell: it is the heavy weather and heat that make me
dull; and I walked about, before you came, a great deal for me.  Tell
uncle I'm in tolerable health, will you?'

'I'll tell him that _you_ say so, Linton.  I couldn't affirm that you
are,' observed my young lady, wondering at his pertinacious assertion of
what was evidently an untruth.

'And be here again next Thursday,' continued he, shunning her puzzled
gaze.  'And give him my thanks for permitting you to come--my best
thanks, Catherine.  And--and, if you _did_ meet my father, and he asked
you about me, don't lead him to suppose that I've been extremely silent
and stupid: don't look sad and downcast, as you are doing--he'll be
angry.'

'I care nothing for his anger,' exclaimed Cathy, imagining she would be
its object.

'But I do,' said her cousin, shuddering.  '_Don't_ provoke him against
me, Catherine, for he is very hard.'

'Is he severe to you, Master Heathcliff?' I inquired.  'Has he grown
weary of indulgence, and passed from passive to active hatred?'

Linton looked at me, but did not answer; and, after keeping her seat by
his side another ten minutes, during which his head fell drowsily on his
breast, and he uttered nothing except suppressed moans of exhaustion or
pain, Cathy began to seek solace in looking for bilberries, and sharing
the produce of her researches with me: she did not offer them to him, for
she saw further notice would only weary and annoy.

'Is it half-an-hour now, Ellen?' she whispered in my ear, at last.  'I
can't tell why we should stay.  He's asleep, and papa will be wanting us
back.'

'Well, we must not leave him asleep,' I answered; 'wait till he wakes,
and be patient.  You were mighty eager to set off, but your longing to
see poor Linton has soon evaporated!'

'Why did _he_ wish to see me?' returned Catherine.  'In his crossest
humours, formerly, I liked him better than I do in his present curious
mood.  It's just as if it were a task he was compelled to perform--this
interview--for fear his father should scold him.  But I'm hardly going to
come to give Mr. Heathcliff pleasure; whatever reason he may have for
ordering Linton to undergo this penance.  And, though I'm glad he's
better in health, I'm sorry he's so much less pleasant, and so much less
affectionate to me.'

'You think _he is_ better in health, then?' I said.

'Yes,' she answered; 'because he always made such a great deal of his
sufferings, you know.  He is not tolerably well, as he told me to tell
papa; but he's better, very likely.'

'There you differ with me, Miss Cathy,' I remarked; 'I should conjecture
him to be far worse.'

Linton here started from his slumber in bewildered terror, and asked if
any one had called his name.

'No,' said Catherine; 'unless in dreams.  I cannot conceive how you
manage to doze out of doors, in the morning.'

'I thought I heard my father,' he gasped, glancing up to the frowning nab
above us.  'You are sure nobody spoke?'

'Quite sure,' replied his cousin.  'Only Ellen and I were disputing
concerning your health.  Are you truly stronger, Linton, than when we
separated in winter?  If you be, I'm certain one thing is not
stronger--your regard for me: speak,--are you?'

The tears gushed from Linton's eyes as he answered, 'Yes, yes, I am!'
And, still under the spell of the imaginary voice, his gaze wandered up
and down to detect its owner.

Cathy rose.  'For to-day we must part,' she said.  'And I won't conceal
that I have been sadly disappointed with our meeting; though I'll mention
it to nobody but you: not that I stand in awe of Mr. Heathcliff.'

'Hush,' murmured Linton; 'for God's sake, hush!  He's coming.'  And he
clung to Catherine's arm, striving to detain her; but at that
announcement she hastily disengaged herself, and whistled to Minny, who
obeyed her like a dog.

'I'll be here next Thursday,' she cried, springing to the saddle.
'Good-bye. Quick, Ellen!'

And so we left him, scarcely conscious of our departure, so absorbed was
he in anticipating his father's approach.

Before we reached home, Catherine's displeasure softened into a perplexed
sensation of pity and regret, largely blended with vague, uneasy doubts
about Linton's actual circumstances, physical and social: in which I
partook, though I counselled her not to say much; for a second journey
would make us better judges.  My master requested an account of our
ongoings.  His nephew's offering of thanks was duly delivered, Miss Cathy
gently touching on the rest: I also threw little light on his inquiries,
for I hardly knew what to hide and what to reveal.




CHAPTER XXVII


Seven days glided away, every one marking its course by the henceforth
rapid alteration of Edgar Linton's state.  The havoc that months had
previously wrought was now emulated by the inroads of hours.  Catherine
we would fain have deluded yet; but her own quick spirit refused to
delude her: it divined in secret, and brooded on the dreadful
probability, gradually ripening into certainty.  She had not the heart to
mention her ride, when Thursday came round; I mentioned it for her, and
obtained permission to order her out of doors: for the library, where her
father stopped a short time daily--the brief period he could bear to sit
up--and his chamber, had become her whole world.  She grudged each moment
that did not find her bending over his pillow, or seated by his side.  Her
countenance grew wan with watching and sorrow, and my master gladly
dismissed her to what he flattered himself would be a happy change of
scene and society; drawing comfort from the hope that she would not now
be left entirely alone after his death.

He had a fixed idea, I guessed by several observations he let fall, that,
as his nephew resembled him in person, he would resemble him in mind; for
Linton's letters bore few or no indications of his defective character.
And I, through pardonable weakness, refrained from correcting the error;
asking myself what good there would be in disturbing his last moments
with information that he had neither power nor opportunity to turn to
account.

We deferred our excursion till the afternoon; a golden afternoon of
August: every breath from the hills so full of life, that it seemed
whoever respired it, though dying, might revive.  Catherine's face was
just like the landscape--shadows and sunshine flitting over it in rapid
succession; but the shadows rested longer, and the sunshine was more
transient; and her poor little heart reproached itself for even that
passing forgetfulness of its cares.

We discerned Linton watching at the same spot he had selected before.  My
young mistress alighted, and told me that, as she was resolved to stay a
very little while, I had better hold the pony and remain on horseback;
but I dissented: I wouldn't risk losing sight of the charge committed to
me a minute; so we climbed the slope of heath together.  Master
Heathcliff received us with greater animation on this occasion: not the
animation of high spirits though, nor yet of joy; it looked more like
fear.

'It is late!' he said, speaking short and with difficulty.  'Is not your
father very ill?  I thought you wouldn't come.'

'_Why_ won't you be candid?' cried Catherine, swallowing her greeting.
'Why cannot you say at once you don't want me?  It is strange, Linton,
that for the second time you have brought me here on purpose, apparently
to distress us both, and for no reason besides!'

Linton shivered, and glanced at her, half supplicating, half ashamed; but
his cousin's patience was not sufficient to endure this enigmatical
behaviour.

'My father _is_ very ill,' she said; 'and why am I called from his
bedside?  Why didn't you send to absolve me from my promise, when you
wished I wouldn't keep it?  Come!  I desire an explanation: playing and
trifling are completely banished out of my mind; and I can't dance
attendance on your affectations now!'

'My affectations!' he murmured; 'what are they?  For heaven's sake,
Catherine, don't look so angry!  Despise me as much as you please; I am a
worthless, cowardly wretch: I can't be scorned enough; but I'm too mean
for your anger.  Hate my father, and spare me for contempt.'

'Nonsense!' cried Catherine in a passion.  'Foolish, silly boy!  And
there! he trembles: as if I were really going to touch him!  You needn't
bespeak contempt, Linton: anybody will have it spontaneously at your
service.  Get off!  I shall return home: it is folly dragging you from
the hearth-stone, and pretending--what do we pretend?  Let go my frock!
If I pitied you for crying and looking so very frightened, you should
spurn such pity.  Ellen, tell him how disgraceful this conduct is.  Rise,
and don't degrade yourself into an abject reptile--_don't_!'

With streaming face and an expression of agony, Linton had thrown his
nerveless frame along the ground: he seemed convulsed with exquisite
terror.

'Oh!' he sobbed, 'I cannot bear it!  Catherine, Catherine, I'm a traitor,
too, and I dare not tell you!  But leave me, and I shall be killed!
_Dear_ Catherine, my life is in your hands: and you have said you loved
me, and if you did, it wouldn't harm you.  You'll not go, then? kind,
sweet, good Catherine!  And perhaps you _will_ consent--and he'll let me
die with you!'

My young lady, on witnessing his intense anguish, stooped to raise him.
The old feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame her vexation, and she
grew thoroughly moved and alarmed.

'Consent to what?' she asked.  'To stay! tell me the meaning of this
strange talk, and I will.  You contradict your own words, and distract
me!  Be calm and frank, and confess at once all that weighs on your
heart.  You wouldn't injure me, Linton, would you?  You wouldn't let any
enemy hurt me, if you could prevent it?  I'll believe you are a coward,
for yourself, but not a cowardly betrayer of your best friend.'

'But my father threatened me,' gasped the boy, clasping his attenuated
fingers, 'and I dread him--I dread him!  I _dare_ not tell!'

'Oh, well!' said Catherine, with scornful compassion, 'keep your secret:
_I'm_ no coward.  Save yourself: I'm not afraid!'

Her magnanimity provoked his tears: he wept wildly, kissing her
supporting hands, and yet could not summon courage to speak out.  I was
cogitating what the mystery might be, and determined Catherine should
never suffer to benefit him or any one else, by my good will; when,
hearing a rustle among the ling, I looked up and saw Mr. Heathcliff
almost close upon us, descending the Heights.  He didn't cast a glance
towards my companions, though they were sufficiently near for Linton's
sobs to be audible; but hailing me in the almost hearty tone he assumed
to none besides, and the sincerity of which I couldn't avoid doubting, he
said--

'It is something to see you so near to my house, Nelly.  How are you at
the Grange?  Let us hear.  The rumour goes,' he added, in a lower tone,
'that Edgar Linton is on his death-bed: perhaps they exaggerate his
illness?'

'No; my master is dying,' I replied: 'it is true enough.  A sad thing it
will be for us all, but a blessing for him!'

'How long will he last, do you think?' he asked.

'I don't know,' I said.

'Because,' he continued, looking at the two young people, who were fixed
under his eye--Linton appeared as if he could not venture to stir or
raise his head, and Catherine could not move, on his account--'because
that lad yonder seems determined to beat me; and I'd thank his uncle to
be quick, and go before him!  Hallo! has the whelp been playing that game
long?  I _did_ give him some lessons about snivelling.  Is he pretty
lively with Miss Linton generally?'

'Lively? no--he has shown the greatest distress,' I answered.  'To see
him, I should say, that instead of rambling with his sweetheart on the
hills, he ought to be in bed, under the hands of a doctor.'

'He shall be, in a day or two,' muttered Heathcliff.  'But first--get up,
Linton!  Get up!' he shouted.  'Don't grovel on the ground there up, this
moment!'

Linton had sunk prostrate again in another paroxysm of helpless fear,
caused by his father's glance towards him, I suppose: there was nothing
else to produce such humiliation.  He made several efforts to obey, but
his little strength was annihilated for the time, and he fell back again
with a moan.  Mr. Heathcliff advanced, and lifted him to lean against a
ridge of turf.

'Now,' said he, with curbed ferocity, 'I'm getting angry and if you don't
command that paltry spirit of yours--_damn_ you! get up directly!'

'I will, father,' he panted.  'Only, let me alone, or I shall faint.  I've
done as you wished, I'm sure.  Catherine will tell you that I--that
I--have been cheerful.  Ah! keep by me, Catherine; give me your hand.'

'Take mine,' said his father; 'stand on your feet.  There now--she'll
lend you her arm: that's right, look at her.  You would imagine I was the
devil himself, Miss Linton, to excite such horror.  Be so kind as to walk
home with him, will you?  He shudders if I touch him.'

'Linton dear!' whispered Catherine, 'I can't go to Wuthering Heights:
papa has forbidden me.  He'll not harm you: why are you so afraid?'

'I can never re-enter that house,' he answered.  'I'm _not_ to re-enter
it without you!'

'Stop!' cried his father.  'We'll respect Catherine's filial scruples.
Nelly, take him in, and I'll follow your advice concerning the doctor,
without delay.'

'You'll do well,' replied I.  'But I must remain with my mistress: to
mind your son is not my business.'

'You are very stiff,' said Heathcliff, 'I know that: but you'll force me
to pinch the baby and make it scream before it moves your charity.  Come,
then, my hero.  Are you willing to return, escorted by me?'

He approached once more, and made as if he would seize the fragile being;
but, shrinking back, Linton clung to his cousin, and implored her to
accompany him, with a frantic importunity that admitted no denial.
However I disapproved, I couldn't hinder her: indeed, how could she have
refused him herself?  What was filling him with dread we had no means of
discerning; but there he was, powerless under its grip, and any addition
seemed capable of shocking him into idiotcy.  We reached the threshold;
Catherine walked in, and I stood waiting till she had conducted the
invalid to a chair, expecting her out immediately; when Mr. Heathcliff,
pushing me forward, exclaimed--'My house is not stricken with the plague,
Nelly; and I have a mind to be hospitable to-day: sit down, and allow me
to shut the door.'

He shut and locked it also.  I started.

'You shall have tea before you go home,' he added.  'I am by myself.
Hareton is gone with some cattle to the Lees, and Zillah and Joseph are
off on a journey of pleasure; and, though I'm used to being alone, I'd
rather have some interesting company, if I can get it.  Miss Linton, take
your seat by _him_.  I give you what I have: the present is hardly worth
accepting; but I have nothing else to offer.  It is Linton, I mean.  How
she does stare!  It's odd what a savage feeling I have to anything that
seems afraid of me!  Had I been born where laws are less strict and
tastes less dainty, I should treat myself to a slow vivisection of those
two, as an evening's amusement.'

He drew in his breath, struck the table, and swore to himself, 'By hell!
I hate them.'

'I am not afraid of you!' exclaimed Catherine, who could not hear the
latter part of his speech.  She stepped close up; her black eyes flashing
with passion and resolution.  'Give me that key: I will have it!' she
said.  'I wouldn't eat or drink here, if I were starving.'

Heathcliff had the key in his hand that remained on the table.  He looked
up, seized with a sort of surprise at her boldness; or, possibly,
reminded, by her voice and glance, of the person from whom she inherited
it.  She snatched at the instrument, and half succeeded in getting it out
of his loosened fingers: but her action recalled him to the present; he
recovered it speedily.

'Now, Catherine Linton,' he said, 'stand off, or I shall knock you down;
and, that will make Mrs. Dean mad.'

Regardless of this warning, she captured his closed hand and its contents
again.  'We _will_ go!' she repeated, exerting her utmost efforts to cause
the iron muscles to relax; and finding that her nails made no impression,
she applied her teeth pretty sharply.  Heathcliff glanced at me a glance
that kept me from interfering a moment.  Catherine was too intent on his
fingers to notice his face.  He opened them suddenly, and resigned the
object of dispute; but, ere she had well secured it, he seized her with
the liberated hand, and, pulling her on his knee, administered with the
other a shower of terrific slaps on both sides of the head, each
sufficient to have fulfilled his threat, had she been able to fall.

At this diabolical violence I rushed on him furiously. 'You villain!' I
began to cry, 'you villain!' A touch on the chest silenced me: I am
stout, and soon put out of breath; and, what with that and the rage, I
staggered dizzily back and felt ready to suffocate, or to burst a
blood-vessel. The scene was over in two minutes; Catherine, released,
put her two hands to her temples, and looked just as if she were not
sure whether her ears were off or on. She trembled like a reed, poor
thing, and leant against the table perfectly bewildered.

'I know how to chastise children, you see,' said the scoundrel, grimly,
as he stooped to repossess himself of the key, which had dropped to the
floor.  'Go to Linton now, as I told you; and cry at your ease!  I shall
be your father, to-morrow--all the father you'll have in a few days--and
you shall have plenty of that.  You can bear plenty; you're no weakling:
you shall have a daily taste, if I catch such a devil of a temper in your
eyes again!'

Cathy ran to me instead of Linton, and knelt down and put her burning
cheek on my lap, weeping aloud.  Her cousin had shrunk into a corner of
the settle, as quiet as a mouse, congratulating himself, I dare say, that
the correction had alighted on another than him.  Mr. Heathcliff,
perceiving us all confounded, rose, and expeditiously made the tea
himself.  The cups and saucers were laid ready.  He poured it out, and
handed me a cup.

'Wash away your spleen,' he said.  'And help your own naughty pet and
mine.  It is not poisoned, though I prepared it.  I'm going out to seek
your horses.'

Our first thought, on his departure, was to force an exit somewhere.  We
tried the kitchen door, but that was fastened outside: we looked at the
windows--they were too narrow for even Cathy's little figure.

'Master Linton,' I cried, seeing we were regularly imprisoned, 'you know
what your diabolical father is after, and you shall tell us, or I'll box
your ears, as he has done your cousin's.'

'Yes, Linton, you must tell,' said Catherine.  'It was for your sake I
came; and it will be wickedly ungrateful if you refuse.'

'Give me some tea, I'm thirsty, and then I'll tell you,' he answered.
'Mrs. Dean, go away.  I don't like you standing over me.  Now, Catherine,
you are letting your tears fall into my cup.  I won't drink that.  Give
me another.'  Catherine pushed another to him, and wiped her face.  I
felt disgusted at the little wretch's composure, since he was no longer
in terror for himself.  The anguish he had exhibited on the moor subsided
as soon as ever he entered Wuthering Heights; so I guessed he had been
menaced with an awful visitation of wrath if he failed in decoying us
there; and, that accomplished, he had no further immediate fears.

'Papa wants us to be married,' he continued, after sipping some of the
liquid.  'And he knows your papa wouldn't let us marry now; and he's
afraid of my dying if we wait; so we are to be married in the morning,
and you are to stay here all night; and, if you do as he wishes, you
shall return home next day, and take me with you.'

'Take you with her, pitiful changeling!' I exclaimed.  '_You_ marry?  Why,
the man is mad! or he thinks us fools, every one.  And do you imagine
that beautiful young lady, that healthy, hearty girl, will tie herself to
a little perishing monkey like you?  Are you cherishing the notion that
anybody, let alone Miss Catherine Linton, would have you for a husband?
You want whipping for bringing us in here at all, with your dastardly
puling tricks: and--don't look so silly, now!  I've a very good mind to
shake you severely, for your contemptible treachery, and your imbecile
conceit.'

I did give him a slight shaking; but it brought on the cough, and he took
to his ordinary resource of moaning and weeping, and Catherine rebuked
me.

'Stay all night?  No,' she said, looking slowly round.  'Ellen, I'll burn
that door down but I'll get out.'

And she would have commenced the execution of her threat directly, but
Linton was up in alarm for his dear self again.  He clasped her in his
two feeble arms sobbing:--'Won't you have me, and save me? not let me
come to the Grange?  Oh, darling Catherine! you mustn't go and leave,
after all.  You _must_ obey my father--you _must_!'

'I must obey my own,' she replied, 'and relieve him from this cruel
suspense.  The whole night!  What would he think?  He'll be distressed
already.  I'll either break or burn a way out of the house.  Be quiet!
You're in no danger; but if you hinder me--Linton, I love papa better
than you!'  The mortal terror he felt of Mr. Heathcliff's anger restored
to the boy his coward's eloquence.  Catherine was near distraught: still,
she persisted that she must go home, and tried entreaty in her turn,
persuading him to subdue his selfish agony.  While they were thus
occupied, our jailor re-entered.

'Your beasts have trotted off,' he said, 'and--now Linton! snivelling
again?  What has she been doing to you?  Come, come--have done, and get
to bed.  In a month or two, my lad, you'll be able to pay her back her
present tyrannies with a vigorous hand.  You're pining for pure love, are
you not? nothing else in the world: and she shall have you!  There, to
bed!  Zillah won't be here to-night; you must undress yourself.  Hush!
hold your noise!  Once in your own room, I'll not come near you: you
needn't fear.  By chance, you've managed tolerably.  I'll look to the
rest.'

He spoke these words, holding the door open for his son to pass, and the
latter achieved his exit exactly as a spaniel might which suspected the
person who attended on it of designing a spiteful squeeze.  The lock was
re-secured.  Heathcliff approached the fire, where my mistress and I
stood silent.  Catherine looked up, and instinctively raised her hand to
her cheek: his neighbourhood revived a painful sensation.  Anybody else
would have been incapable of regarding the childish act with sternness,
but he scowled on her and muttered--'Oh! you are not afraid of me?  Your
courage is well disguised: you seem damnably afraid!'

'I _am_ afraid now,' she replied, 'because, if I stay, papa will be
miserable: and how can I endure making him miserable--when he--when
he--Mr. Heathcliff, let _me_ go home!  I promise to marry Linton: papa
would like me to: and I love him.  Why should you wish to force me to do
what I'll willingly do of myself?'

'Let him dare to force you,' I cried.  'There's law in the land, thank
God! there is; though we be in an out-of-the-way place.  I'd inform if he
were my own son: and it's felony without benefit of clergy!'

'Silence!' said the ruffian.  'To the devil with your clamour!  I don't
want _you_ to speak.  Miss Linton, I shall enjoy myself remarkably in
thinking your father will be miserable: I shall not sleep for
satisfaction.  You could have hit on no surer way of fixing your
residence under my roof for the next twenty-four hours than informing me
that such an event would follow.  As to your promise to marry Linton,
I'll take care you shall keep it; for you shall not quit this place till
it is fulfilled.'

'Send Ellen, then, to let papa know I'm safe!' exclaimed Catherine,
weeping bitterly.  'Or marry me now.  Poor papa!  Ellen, he'll think
we're lost.  What shall we do?'

'Not he!  He'll think you are tired of waiting on him, and run off for a
little amusement,' answered Heathcliff.  'You cannot deny that you
entered my house of your own accord, in contempt of his injunctions to
the contrary.  And it is quite natural that you should desire amusement
at your age; and that you would weary of nursing a sick man, and that man
_only_ your father.  Catherine, his happiest days were over when your
days began.  He cursed you, I dare say, for coming into the world (I did,
at least); and it would just do if he cursed you as _he_ went out of it.
I'd join him.  I don't love you!  How should I?  Weep away.  As far as I
can see, it will be your chief diversion hereafter; unless Linton make
amends for other losses: and your provident parent appears to fancy he
may.  His letters of advice and consolation entertained me vastly.  In
his last he recommended my jewel to be careful of his; and kind to her
when he got her.  Careful and kind--that's paternal.  But Linton requires
his whole stock of care and kindness for himself.  Linton can play the
little tyrant well.  He'll undertake to torture any number of cats, if
their teeth be drawn and their claws pared.  You'll be able to tell his
uncle fine tales of his _kindness_, when you get home again, I assure
you.'

'You're right there!' I said; 'explain your son's character.  Show his
resemblance to yourself: and then, I hope, Miss Cathy will think twice
before she takes the cockatrice!'

'I don't much mind speaking of his amiable qualities now,' he answered;
'because she must either accept him or remain a prisoner, and you along
with her, till your master dies.  I can detain you both, quite concealed,
here.  If you doubt, encourage her to retract her word, and you'll have
an opportunity of judging!'

'I'll not retract my word,' said Catherine.  'I'll marry him within this
hour, if I may go to Thrushcross Grange afterwards.  Mr. Heathcliff,
you're a cruel man, but you're not a fiend; and you won't, from _mere_
malice, destroy irrevocably all my happiness.  If papa thought I had left
him on purpose, and if he died before I returned, could I bear to live?
I've given over crying: but I'm going to kneel here, at your knee; and
I'll not get up, and I'll not take my eyes from your face till you look
back at me!  No, don't turn away! _do look_! you'll see nothing to
provoke you.  I don't hate you.  I'm not angry that you struck me.  Have
you never loved _anybody_ in all your life, uncle? _never_?  Ah! you must
look once.  I'm so wretched, you can't help being sorry and pitying me.'

'Keep your eft's fingers off; and move, or I'll kick you!' cried
Heathcliff, brutally repulsing her.  'I'd rather be hugged by a snake.
How the devil can you dream of fawning on me?  I _detest_ you!'

He shrugged his shoulders: shook himself, indeed, as if his flesh crept
with aversion; and thrust back his chair; while I got up, and opened my
mouth, to commence a downright torrent of abuse.  But I was rendered dumb
in the middle of the first sentence, by a threat that I should be shown
into a room by myself the very next syllable I uttered.  It was growing
dark--we heard a sound of voices at the garden-gate.  Our host hurried
out instantly: _he_ had his wits about him; _we_ had not.  There was a
talk of two or three minutes, and he returned alone.

'I thought it had been your cousin Hareton,' I observed to Catherine.  'I
wish he would arrive!  Who knows but he might take our part?'

'It was three servants sent to seek you from the Grange,' said
Heathcliff, overhearing me.  'You should have opened a lattice and called
out: but I could swear that chit is glad you didn't.  She's glad to be
obliged to stay, I'm certain.'

At learning the chance we had missed, we both gave vent to our grief
without control; and he allowed us to wail on till nine o'clock.  Then he
bid us go upstairs, through the kitchen, to Zillah's chamber; and I
whispered my companion to obey: perhaps we might contrive to get through
the window there, or into a garret, and out by its skylight.  The window,
however, was narrow, like those below, and the garret trap was safe from
our attempts; for we were fastened in as before.  We neither of us lay
down: Catherine took her station by the lattice, and watched anxiously
for morning; a deep sigh being the only answer I could obtain to my
frequent entreaties that she would try to rest.  I seated myself in a
chair, and rocked to and fro, passing harsh judgment on my many
derelictions of duty; from which, it struck me then, all the misfortunes
of my employers sprang.  It was not the case, in reality, I am aware; but
it was, in my imagination, that dismal night; and I thought Heathcliff
himself less guilty than I.

At seven o'clock he came, and inquired if Miss Linton had risen.  She ran
to the door immediately, and answered, 'Yes.'  'Here, then,' he said,
opening it, and pulling her out.  I rose to follow, but he turned the
lock again.  I demanded my release.

'Be patient,' he replied; 'I'll send up your breakfast in a while.'

I thumped on the panels, and rattled the latch angrily and Catherine
asked why I was still shut up?  He answered, I must try to endure it
another hour, and they went away.  I endured it two or three hours; at
length, I heard a footstep: not Heathcliff's.

'I've brought you something to eat,' said a voice; 'oppen t' door!'

Complying eagerly, I beheld Hareton, laden with food enough to last me
all day.

'Tak' it,' he added, thrusting the tray into my hand.

'Stay one minute,' I began.

'Nay,' cried he, and retired, regardless of any prayers I could pour
forth to detain him.

And there I remained enclosed the whole day, and the whole of the next
night; and another, and another.  Five nights and four days I remained,
altogether, seeing nobody but Hareton once every morning; and he was a
model of a jailor: surly, and dumb, and deaf to every attempt at moving
his sense of justice or compassion.




CHAPTER XXVIII


On the fifth morning, or rather afternoon, a different step
approached--lighter and shorter; and, this time, the person entered the
room.  It was Zillah; donned in her scarlet shawl, with a black silk
bonnet on her head, and a willow-basket swung to her arm.

'Eh, dear!  Mrs. Dean!' she exclaimed.  'Well! there is a talk about you
at Gimmerton.  I never thought but you were sunk in the Blackhorse marsh,
and missy with you, till master told me you'd been found, and he'd lodged
you here!  What! and you must have got on an island, sure?  And how long
were you in the hole?  Did master save you, Mrs. Dean?  But you're not so
thin--you've not been so poorly, have you?'

'Your master is a true scoundrel!' I replied.  'But he shall answer for
it.  He needn't have raised that tale: it shall all be laid bare!'

'What do you mean?' asked Zillah.  'It's not his tale: they tell that in
the village--about your being lost in the marsh; and I calls to Earnshaw,
when I come in--"Eh, they's queer things, Mr. Hareton, happened since I
went off.  It's a sad pity of that likely young lass, and cant Nelly
Dean."  He stared.  I thought he had not heard aught, so I told him the
rumour.  The master listened, and he just smiled to himself, and said,
"If they have been in the marsh, they are out now, Zillah.  Nelly Dean is
lodged, at this minute, in your room.  You can tell her to flit, when you
go up; here is the key.  The bog-water got into her head, and she would
have run home quite flighty; but I fixed her till she came round to her
senses.  You can bid her go to the Grange at once, if she be able, and
carry a message from me, that her young lady will follow in time to
attend the squire's funeral."'

'Mr. Edgar is not dead?' I gasped.  'Oh! Zillah, Zillah!'

'No, no; sit you down, my good mistress,' she replied; 'you're right
sickly yet.  He's not dead; Doctor Kenneth thinks he may last another
day.  I met him on the road and asked.'

Instead of sitting down, I snatched my outdoor things, and hastened
below, for the way was free.  On entering the house, I looked about for
some one to give information of Catherine.  The place was filled with
sunshine, and the door stood wide open; but nobody seemed at hand.  As I
hesitated whether to go off at once, or return and seek my mistress, a
slight cough drew my attention to the hearth.  Linton lay on the settle,
sole tenant, sucking a stick of sugar-candy, and pursuing my movements
with apathetic eyes.  'Where is Miss Catherine?' I demanded sternly,
supposing I could frighten him into giving intelligence, by catching him
thus, alone.  He sucked on like an innocent.

'Is she gone?' I said.

'No,' he replied; 'she's upstairs: she's not to go; we won't let her.'

'You won't let her, little idiot!' I exclaimed.  'Direct me to her room
immediately, or I'll make you sing out sharply.'

'Papa would make you sing out, if you attempted to get there,' he
answered.  'He says I'm not to be soft with Catherine: she's my wife, and
it's shameful that she should wish to leave me.  He says she hates me and
wants me to die, that she may have my money; but she shan't have it: and
she shan't go home!  She never shall!--she may cry, and be sick as much
as she pleases!'

He resumed his former occupation, closing his lids, as if he meant to
drop asleep.

'Master Heathcliff,' I resumed, 'have you forgotten all Catherine's
kindness to you last winter, when you affirmed you loved her, and when
she brought you books and sung you songs, and came many a time through
wind and snow to see you?  She wept to miss one evening, because you
would be disappointed; and you felt then that she was a hundred times too
good to you: and now you believe the lies your father tells, though you
know he detests you both.  And you join him against her.  That's fine
gratitude, is it not?'

The corner of Linton's mouth fell, and he took the sugar-candy from his
lips.

'Did she come to Wuthering Heights because she hated you?' I continued.
'Think for yourself!  As to your money, she does not even know that you
will have any.  And you say she's sick; and yet you leave her alone, up
there in a strange house!  You who have felt what it is to be so
neglected!  You could pity your own sufferings; and she pitied them, too;
but you won't pity hers!  I shed tears, Master Heathcliff, you see--an
elderly woman, and a servant merely--and you, after pretending such
affection, and having reason to worship her almost, store every tear you
have for yourself, and lie there quite at ease.  Ah! you're a heartless,
selfish boy!'

'I can't stay with her,' he answered crossly.  'I'll not stay by myself.
She cries so I can't bear it.  And she won't give over, though I say I'll
call my father.  I did call him once, and he threatened to strangle her
if she was not quiet; but she began again the instant he left the room,
moaning and grieving all night long, though I screamed for vexation that
I couldn't sleep.'

'Is Mr. Heathcliff out?' I inquired, perceiving that the wretched
creature had no power to sympathize with his cousin's mental tortures.

'He's in the court,' he replied, 'talking to Doctor Kenneth; who says
uncle is dying, truly, at last.  I'm glad, for I shall be master of the
Grange after him.  Catherine always spoke of it as her house.  It isn't
hers!  It's mine: papa says everything she has is mine.  All her nice
books are mine; she offered to give me them, and her pretty birds, and
her pony Minny, if I would get the key of our room, and let her out; but
I told her she had nothing to give, they were all, all mine.  And then
she cried, and took a little picture from her neck, and said I should
have that; two pictures in a gold case, on one side her mother, and on
the other uncle, when they were young.  That was yesterday--I said they
were mine, too; and tried to get them from her.  The spiteful thing
wouldn't let me: she pushed me off, and hurt me.  I shrieked out--that
frightens her--she heard papa coming, and she broke the hinges and
divided the case, and gave me her mother's portrait; the other she
attempted to hide: but papa asked what was the matter, and I explained
it.  He took the one I had away, and ordered her to resign hers to me;
she refused, and he--he struck her down, and wrenched it off the chain,
and crushed it with his foot.'

'And were you pleased to see her struck?' I asked: having my designs in
encouraging his talk.

'I winked,' he answered: 'I wink to see my father strike a dog or a
horse, he does it so hard.  Yet I was glad at first--she deserved
punishing for pushing me: but when papa was gone, she made me come to the
window and showed me her cheek cut on the inside, against her teeth, and
her mouth filling with blood; and then she gathered up the bits of the
picture, and went and sat down with her face to the wall, and she has
never spoken to me since: and I sometimes think she can't speak for pain.
I don't like to think so; but she's a naughty thing for crying
continually; and she looks so pale and wild, I'm afraid of her.'

'And you can get the key if you choose?' I said.

'Yes, when I am up-stairs,' he answered; 'but I can't walk up-stairs
now.'

'In what apartment is it?' I asked.

'Oh,' he cried, 'I shan't tell _you_ where it is.  It is our secret.
Nobody, neither Hareton nor Zillah, is to know.  There! you've tired
me--go away, go away!'  And he turned his face on to his arm, and shut
his eyes again.

I considered it best to depart without seeing Mr. Heathcliff, and bring a
rescue for my young lady from the Grange.  On reaching it, the
astonishment of my fellow-servants to see me, and their joy also, was
intense; and when they heard that their little mistress was safe, two or
three were about to hurry up and shout the news at Mr. Edgar's door: but
I bespoke the announcement of it myself.  How changed I found him, even
in those few days!  He lay an image of sadness and resignation awaiting
his death.  Very young he looked: though his actual age was thirty-nine,
one would have called him ten years younger, at least.  He thought of
Catherine; for he murmured her name.  I touched his hand, and spoke.

'Catherine is coming, dear master!' I whispered; 'she is alive and well;
and will be here, I hope, to-night.'

I trembled at the first effects of this intelligence: he half rose up,
looked eagerly round the apartment, and then sank back in a swoon.  As
soon as he recovered, I related our compulsory visit, and detention at
the Heights.  I said Heathcliff forced me to go in: which was not quite
true.  I uttered as little as possible against Linton; nor did I describe
all his father's brutal conduct--my intentions being to add no
bitterness, if I could help it, to his already over-flowing cup.

He divined that one of his enemy's purposes was to secure the personal
property, as well as the estate, to his son: or rather himself; yet why
he did not wait till his decease was a puzzle to my master, because
ignorant how nearly he and his nephew would quit the world together.
However, he felt that his will had better be altered: instead of leaving
Catherine's fortune at her own disposal, he determined to put it in the
hands of trustees for her use during life, and for her children, if she
had any, after her.  By that means, it could not fall to Mr. Heathcliff
should Linton die.

Having received his orders, I despatched a man to fetch the attorney, and
four more, provided with serviceable weapons, to demand my young lady of
her jailor.  Both parties were delayed very late.  The single servant
returned first.  He said Mr. Green, the lawyer, was out when he arrived
at his house, and he had to wait two hours for his re-entrance; and then
Mr. Green told him he had a little business in the village that must be
done; but he would be at Thrushcross Grange before morning.  The four men
came back unaccompanied also.  They brought word that Catherine was ill:
too ill to quit her room; and Heathcliff would not suffer them to see
her.  I scolded the stupid fellows well for listening to that tale, which
I would not carry to my master; resolving to take a whole bevy up to the
Heights, at day-light, and storm it literally, unless the prisoner were
quietly surrendered to us.  Her father _shall_ see her, I vowed, and
vowed again, if that devil be killed on his own doorstones in trying to
prevent it!

Happily, I was spared the journey and the trouble.  I had gone
down-stairs at three o'clock to fetch a jug of water; and was passing
through the hall with it in my hand, when a sharp knock at the front door
made me jump.  'Oh! it is Green,' I said, recollecting myself--'only
Green,' and I went on, intending to send somebody else to open it; but
the knock was repeated: not loud, and still importunately.  I put the jug
on the banister and hastened to admit him myself.  The harvest moon shone
clear outside.  It was not the attorney.  My own sweet little mistress
sprang on my neck sobbing, 'Ellen, Ellen!  Is papa alive?'

'Yes,' I cried: 'yes, my angel, he is, God be thanked, you are safe with
us again!'

She wanted to run, breathless as she was, up-stairs to Mr. Linton's room;
but I compelled her to sit down on a chair, and made her drink, and
washed her pale face, chafing it into a faint colour with my apron.  Then
I said I must go first, and tell of her arrival; imploring her to say,
she should be happy with young Heathcliff.  She stared, but soon
comprehending why I counselled her to utter the falsehood, she assured me
she would not complain.

I couldn't abide to be present at their meeting.  I stood outside the
chamber-door a quarter of an hour, and hardly ventured near the bed,
then.  All was composed, however: Catherine's despair was as silent as
her father's joy.  She supported him calmly, in appearance; and he fixed
on her features his raised eyes that seemed dilating with ecstasy.

He died blissfully, Mr. Lockwood: he died so.  Kissing her cheek, he
murmured,--'I am going to her; and you, darling child, shall come to us!'
and never stirred or spoke again; but continued that rapt, radiant gaze,
till his pulse imperceptibly stopped and his soul departed.  None could
have noticed the exact minute of his death, it was so entirely without a
struggle.

Whether Catherine had spent her tears, or whether the grief were too
weighty to let them flow, she sat there dry-eyed till the sun rose: she
sat till noon, and would still have remained brooding over that deathbed,
but I insisted on her coming away and taking some repose.  It was well I
succeeded in removing her, for at dinner-time appeared the lawyer, having
called at Wuthering Heights to get his instructions how to behave.  He
had sold himself to Mr. Heathcliff: that was the cause of his delay in
obeying my master's summons.  Fortunately, no thought of worldly affairs
crossed the latter's mind, to disturb him, after his daughter's arrival.

Mr. Green took upon himself to order everything and everybody about the
place.  He gave all the servants but me, notice to quit.  He would have
carried his delegated authority to the point of insisting that Edgar
Linton should not be buried beside his wife, but in the chapel, with his
family.  There was the will, however, to hinder that, and my loud
protestations against any infringement of its directions.  The funeral
was hurried over; Catherine, Mrs. Linton Heathcliff now, was suffered to
stay at the Grange till her father's corpse had quitted it.

She told me that her anguish had at last spurred Linton to incur the risk
of liberating her.  She heard the men I sent disputing at the door, and
she gathered the sense of Heathcliff's answer.  It drove her desperate.
Linton who had been conveyed up to the little parlour soon after I left,
was terrified into fetching the key before his father re-ascended.  He
had the cunning to unlock and re-lock the door, without shutting it; and
when he should have gone to bed, he begged to sleep with Hareton, and his
petition was granted for once.  Catherine stole out before break of day.
She dared not try the doors lest the dogs should raise an alarm; she
visited the empty chambers and examined their windows; and, luckily,
lighting on her mother's, she got easily out of its lattice, and on to
the ground, by means of the fir-tree close by.  Her accomplice suffered
for his share in the escape, notwithstanding his timid contrivances.




CHAPTER XXIX


The evening after the funeral, my young lady and I were seated in the
library; now musing mournfully--one of us despairingly--on our loss, now
venturing conjectures as to the gloomy future.

We had just agreed the best destiny which could await Catherine would be
a permission to continue resident at the Grange; at least during Linton's
life: he being allowed to join her there, and I to remain as housekeeper.
That seemed rather too favourable an arrangement to be hoped for; and yet
I did hope, and began to cheer up under the prospect of retaining my home
and my employment, and, above all, my beloved young mistress; when a
servant--one of the discarded ones, not yet departed--rushed hastily in,
and said 'that devil Heathcliff' was coming through the court: should he
fasten the door in his face?

If we had been mad enough to order that proceeding, we had not time.  He
made no ceremony of knocking or announcing his name: he was master, and
availed himself of the master's privilege to walk straight in, without
saying a word.  The sound of our informant's voice directed him to the
library; he entered and motioning him out, shut the door.

It was the same room into which he had been ushered, as a guest, eighteen
years before: the same moon shone through the window; and the same autumn
landscape lay outside.  We had not yet lighted a candle, but all the
apartment was visible, even to the portraits on the wall: the splendid
head of Mrs. Linton, and the graceful one of her husband.  Heathcliff
advanced to the hearth.  Time had little altered his person either.  There
was the same man: his dark face rather sallower and more composed, his
frame a stone or two heavier, perhaps, and no other difference.  Catherine
had risen with an impulse to dash out, when she saw him.

'Stop!' he said, arresting her by the arm.  'No more runnings away!  Where
would you go?  I'm come to fetch you home; and I hope you'll be a dutiful
daughter and not encourage my son to further disobedience.  I was
embarrassed how to punish him when I discovered his part in the business:
he's such a cobweb, a pinch would annihilate him; but you'll see by his
look that he has received his due!  I brought him down one evening, the
day before yesterday, and just set him in a chair, and never touched him
afterwards.  I sent Hareton out, and we had the room to ourselves.  In
two hours, I called Joseph to carry him up again; and since then my
presence is as potent on his nerves as a ghost; and I fancy he sees me
often, though I am not near.  Hareton says he wakes and shrieks in the
night by the hour together, and calls you to protect him from me; and,
whether you like your precious mate, or not, you must come: he's your
concern now; I yield all my interest in him to you.'

'Why not let Catherine continue here,' I pleaded, 'and send Master Linton
to her?  As you hate them both, you'd not miss them: they can only be a
daily plague to your unnatural heart.'

'I'm seeking a tenant for the Grange,' he answered; 'and I want my
children about me, to be sure.  Besides, that lass owes me her services
for her bread.  I'm not going to nurture her in luxury and idleness after
Linton is gone.  Make haste and get ready, now; and don't oblige me to
compel you.'

'I shall,' said Catherine.  'Linton is all I have to love in the world,
and though you have done what you could to make him hateful to me, and me
to him, you cannot make us hate each other.  And I defy you to hurt him
when I am by, and I defy you to frighten me!'

'You are a boastful champion,' replied Heathcliff; 'but I don't like you
well enough to hurt him: you shall get the full benefit of the torment,
as long as it lasts.  It is not I who will make him hateful to you--it is
his own sweet spirit.  He's as bitter as gall at your desertion and its
consequences: don't expect thanks for this noble devotion.  I heard him
draw a pleasant picture to Zillah of what he would do if he were as
strong as I: the inclination is there, and his very weakness will sharpen
his wits to find a substitute for strength.'

'I know he has a bad nature,' said Catherine: 'he's your son.  But I'm
glad I've a better, to forgive it; and I know he loves me, and for that
reason I love him.  Mr. Heathcliff _you_ have _nobody_ to love you; and,
however miserable you make us, we shall still have the revenge of
thinking that your cruelty arises from your greater misery.  You _are_
miserable, are you not?  Lonely, like the devil, and envious like him?
_Nobody_ loves you--_nobody_ will cry for you when you die!  I wouldn't
be you!'

Catherine spoke with a kind of dreary triumph: she seemed to have made up
her mind to enter into the spirit of her future family, and draw pleasure
from the griefs of her enemies.

'You shall be sorry to be yourself presently,' said her father-in-law,
'if you stand there another minute.  Begone, witch, and get your things!'

She scornfully withdrew.  In her absence I began to beg for Zillah's
place at the Heights, offering to resign mine to her; but he would suffer
it on no account.  He bid me be silent; and then, for the first time,
allowed himself a glance round the room and a look at the pictures.
Having studied Mrs. Linton's, he said--'I shall have that home.  Not
because I need it, but--'  He turned abruptly to the fire, and continued,
with what, for lack of a better word, I must call a smile--'I'll tell you
what I did yesterday!  I got the sexton, who was digging Linton's grave,
to remove the earth off her coffin lid, and I opened it.  I thought,
once, I would have stayed there: when I saw her face again--it is hers
yet!--he had hard work to stir me; but he said it would change if the air
blew on it, and so I struck one side of the coffin loose, and covered it
up: not Linton's side, damn him!  I wish he'd been soldered in lead.  And
I bribed the sexton to pull it away when I'm laid there, and slide mine
out too; I'll have it made so: and then by the time Linton gets to us
he'll not know which is which!'

'You were very wicked, Mr. Heathcliff!' I exclaimed; 'were you not
ashamed to disturb the dead?'

'I disturbed nobody, Nelly,' he replied; 'and I gave some ease to myself.
I shall be a great deal more comfortable now; and you'll have a better
chance of keeping me underground, when I get there.  Disturbed her?  No!
she has disturbed me, night and day, through eighteen
years--incessantly--remorselessly--till yesternight; and yesternight I
was tranquil.  I dreamt I was sleeping the last sleep by that sleeper,
with my heart stopped and my cheek frozen against hers.'

'And if she had been dissolved into earth, or worse, what would you have
dreamt of then?' I said.

'Of dissolving with her, and being more happy still!' he answered.  'Do
you suppose I dread any change of that sort?  I expected such a
transformation on raising the lid--but I'm better pleased that it should
not commence till I share it.  Besides, unless I had received a distinct
impression of her passionless features, that strange feeling would hardly
have been removed.  It began oddly.  You know I was wild after she died;
and eternally, from dawn to dawn, praying her to return to me her spirit!
I have a strong faith in ghosts: I have a conviction that they can, and
do, exist among us!  The day she was buried, there came a fall of snow.
In the evening I went to the churchyard.  It blew bleak as winter--all
round was solitary.  I didn't fear that her fool of a husband would
wander up the glen so late; and no one else had business to bring them
there.  Being alone, and conscious two yards of loose earth was the sole
barrier between us, I said to myself--"I'll have her in my arms again!  If
she be cold, I'll think it is this north wind that chills _me_; and if
she be motionless, it is sleep."  I got a spade from the tool-house, and
began to delve with all my might--it scraped the coffin; I fell to work
with my hands; the wood commenced cracking about the screws; I was on the
point of attaining my object, when it seemed that I heard a sigh from
some one above, close at the edge of the grave, and bending down.  "If I
can only get this off," I muttered, "I wish they may shovel in the earth
over us both!" and I wrenched at it more desperately still.  There was
another sigh, close at my ear.  I appeared to feel the warm breath of it
displacing the sleet-laden wind.  I knew no living thing in flesh and
blood was by; but, as certainly as you perceive the approach to some
substantial body in the dark, though it cannot be discerned, so certainly
I felt that Cathy was there: not under me, but on the earth.  A sudden
sense of relief flowed from my heart through every limb.  I relinquished
my labour of agony, and turned consoled at once: unspeakably consoled.
Her presence was with me: it remained while I re-filled the grave, and
led me home.  You may laugh, if you will; but I was sure I should see her
there.  I was sure she was with me, and I could not help talking to her.
Having reached the Heights, I rushed eagerly to the door.  It was
fastened; and, I remember, that accursed Earnshaw and my wife opposed my
entrance.  I remember stopping to kick the breath out of him, and then
hurrying up-stairs, to my room and hers.  I looked round impatiently--I
felt her by me--I could _almost_ see her, and yet I _could not_!  I ought
to have sweat blood then, from the anguish of my yearning--from the
fervour of my supplications to have but one glimpse!  I had not one.  She
showed herself, as she often was in life, a devil to me!  And, since
then, sometimes more and sometimes less, I've been the sport of that
intolerable torture!  Infernal! keeping my nerves at such a stretch that,
if they had not resembled catgut, they would long ago have relaxed to the
feebleness of Linton's.  When I sat in the house with Hareton, it seemed
that on going out I should meet her; when I walked on the moors I should
meet her coming in.  When I went from home I hastened to return; she
_must_ be somewhere at the Heights, I was certain!  And when I slept in
her chamber--I was beaten out of that.  I couldn't lie there; for the
moment I closed my eyes, she was either outside the window, or sliding
back the panels, or entering the room, or even resting her darling head
on the same pillow as she did when a child; and I must open my lids to
see.  And so I opened and closed them a hundred times a night--to be
always disappointed!  It racked me!  I've often groaned aloud, till that
old rascal Joseph no doubt believed that my conscience was playing the
fiend inside of me.  Now, since I've seen her, I'm pacified--a little.  It
was a strange way of killing: not by inches, but by fractions of
hairbreadths, to beguile me with the spectre of a hope through eighteen
years!'

Mr. Heathcliff paused and wiped his forehead; his hair clung to it, wet
with perspiration; his eyes were fixed on the red embers of the fire, the
brows not contracted, but raised next the temples; diminishing the grim
aspect of his countenance, but imparting a peculiar look of trouble, and
a painful appearance of mental tension towards one absorbing subject.  He
only half addressed me, and I maintained silence.  I didn't like to hear
him talk!  After a short period he resumed his meditation on the picture,
took it down and leant it against the sofa to contemplate it at better
advantage; and while so occupied Catherine entered, announcing that she
was ready, when her pony should be saddled.

'Send that over to-morrow,' said Heathcliff to me; then turning to her,
he added: 'You may do without your pony: it is a fine evening, and you'll
need no ponies at Wuthering Heights; for what journeys you take, your own
feet will serve you.  Come along.'

'Good-bye, Ellen!' whispered my dear little mistress.

As she kissed me, her lips felt like ice.  'Come and see me, Ellen; don't
forget.'

'Take care you do no such thing, Mrs. Dean!' said her new father.  'When
I wish to speak to you I'll come here.  I want none of your prying at my
house!'

He signed her to precede him; and casting back a look that cut my heart,
she obeyed.  I watched them, from the window, walk down the garden.
Heathcliff fixed Catherine's arm under his: though she disputed the act
at first evidently; and with rapid strides he hurried her into the alley,
whose trees concealed them.




CHAPTER XXX


I have paid a visit to the Heights, but I have not seen her since she
left: Joseph held the door in his hand when I called to ask after her,
and wouldn't let me pass.  He said Mrs. Linton was 'thrang,' and the
master was not in.  Zillah has told me something of the way they go on,
otherwise I should hardly know who was dead and who living.  She thinks
Catherine haughty, and does not like her, I can guess by her talk.  My
young lady asked some aid of her when she first came; but Mr. Heathcliff
told her to follow her own business, and let his daughter-in-law look
after herself; and Zillah willingly acquiesced, being a narrow-minded,
selfish woman.  Catherine evinced a child's annoyance at this neglect;
repaid it with contempt, and thus enlisted my informant among her
enemies, as securely as if she had done her some great wrong.  I had a
long talk with Zillah about six weeks ago, a little before you came, one
day when we foregathered on the moor; and this is what she told me.

'The first thing Mrs. Linton did,' she said, 'on her arrival at the
Heights, was to run up-stairs, without even wishing good-evening to me
and Joseph; she shut herself into Linton's room, and remained till
morning.  Then, while the master and Earnshaw were at breakfast, she
entered the house, and asked all in a quiver if the doctor might be sent
for? her cousin was very ill.

'"We know that!" answered Heathcliff; "but his life is not worth a
farthing, and I won't spend a farthing on him."

'"But I cannot tell how to do," she said; "and if nobody will help me,
he'll die!"

'"Walk out of the room," cried the master, "and let me never hear a word
more about him!  None here care what becomes of him; if you do, act the
nurse; if you do not, lock him up and leave him."

'Then she began to bother me, and I said I'd had enough plague with the
tiresome thing; we each had our tasks, and hers was to wait on Linton:
Mr. Heathcliff bid me leave that labour to her.

'How they managed together, I can't tell.  I fancy he fretted a great
deal, and moaned hisseln night and day; and she had precious little rest:
one could guess by her white face and heavy eyes.  She sometimes came
into the kitchen all wildered like, and looked as if she would fain beg
assistance; but I was not going to disobey the master: I never dare
disobey him, Mrs. Dean; and, though I thought it wrong that Kenneth
should not be sent for, it was no concern of mine either to advise or
complain, and I always refused to meddle.  Once or twice, after we had
gone to bed, I've happened to open my door again and seen her sitting
crying on the stairs'-top; and then I've shut myself in quick, for fear
of being moved to interfere.  I did pity her then, I'm sure: still I
didn't wish to lose my place, you know.

'At last, one night she came boldly into my chamber, and frightened me
out of my wits, by saying, "Tell Mr. Heathcliff that his son is dying--I'm
sure he is, this time.  Get up, instantly, and tell him."

'Having uttered this speech, she vanished again.  I lay a quarter of an
hour listening and trembling.  Nothing stirred--the house was quiet.

'She's mistaken, I said to myself.  He's got over it.  I needn't disturb
them; and I began to doze.  But my sleep was marred a second time by a
sharp ringing of the bell--the only bell we have, put up on purpose for
Linton; and the master called to me to see what was the matter, and
inform them that he wouldn't have that noise repeated.

'I delivered Catherine's message.  He cursed to himself, and in a few
minutes came out with a lighted candle, and proceeded to their room.  I
followed.  Mrs. Heathcliff was seated by the bedside, with her hands
folded on her knees.  Her father-in-law went up, held the light to
Linton's face, looked at him, and touched him; afterwards he turned to
her.

'"Now--Catherine," he said, "how do you feel?"

'She was dumb.

'"How do you feel, Catherine?" he repeated.

'"He's safe, and I'm free," she answered: "I should feel well--but," she
continued, with a bitterness she couldn't conceal, "you have left me so
long to struggle against death alone, that I feel and see only death!  I
feel like death!"

'And she looked like it, too!  I gave her a little wine.  Hareton and
Joseph, who had been wakened by the ringing and the sound of feet, and
heard our talk from outside, now entered.  Joseph was fain, I believe, of
the lad's removal; Hareton seemed a thought bothered: though he was more
taken up with staring at Catherine than thinking of Linton.  But the
master bid him get off to bed again: we didn't want his help.  He
afterwards made Joseph remove the body to his chamber, and told me to
return to mine, and Mrs. Heathcliff remained by herself.

'In the morning, he sent me to tell her she must come down to breakfast:
she had undressed, and appeared going to sleep, and said she was ill; at
which I hardly wondered.  I informed Mr. Heathcliff, and he
replied,--"Well, let her be till after the funeral; and go up now and
then to get her what is needful; and, as soon as she seems better, tell
me."'

Cathy stayed upstairs a fortnight, according to Zillah; who visited her
twice a day, and would have been rather more friendly, but her attempts
at increasing kindness were proudly and promptly repelled.

Heathcliff went up once, to show her Linton's will.  He had bequeathed
the whole of his, and what had been her, moveable property, to his
father: the poor creature was threatened, or coaxed, into that act during
her week's absence, when his uncle died.  The lands, being a minor, he
could not meddle with.  However, Mr. Heathcliff has claimed and kept them
in his wife's right and his also: I suppose legally; at any rate,
Catherine, destitute of cash and friends, cannot disturb his possession.

'Nobody,' said Zillah, 'ever approached her door, except that once, but
I; and nobody asked anything about her.  The first occasion of her coming
down into the house was on a Sunday afternoon.  She had cried out, when I
carried up her dinner, that she couldn't bear any longer being in the
cold; and I told her the master was going to Thrushcross Grange, and
Earnshaw and I needn't hinder her from descending; so, as soon as she
heard Heathcliff's horse trot off, she made her appearance, donned in
black, and her yellow curls combed back behind her ears as plain as a
Quaker: she couldn't comb them out.

'Joseph and I generally go to chapel on Sundays:' the kirk, you know, has
no minister now, explained Mrs. Dean; and they call the Methodists' or
Baptists' place (I can't say which it is) at Gimmerton, a chapel.  'Joseph
had gone,' she continued, 'but I thought proper to bide at home.  Young
folks are always the better for an elder's over-looking; and Hareton,
with all his bashfulness, isn't a model of nice behaviour.  I let him
know that his cousin would very likely sit with us, and she had been
always used to see the Sabbath respected; so he had as good leave his
guns and bits of indoor work alone, while she stayed.  He coloured up at
the news, and cast his eyes over his hands and clothes.  The train-oil
and gunpowder were shoved out of sight in a minute.  I saw he meant to
give her his company; and I guessed, by his way, he wanted to be
presentable; so, laughing, as I durst not laugh when the master is by, I
offered to help him, if he would, and joked at his confusion.  He grew
sullen, and began to swear.

'Now, Mrs. Dean,' Zillah went on, seeing me not pleased by her manner,
'you happen think your young lady too fine for Mr. Hareton; and happen
you're right: but I own I should love well to bring her pride a peg
lower.  And what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her,
now?  She's as poor as you or I: poorer, I'll be bound: you're saying,
and I'm doing my little all that road.'

Hareton allowed Zillah to give him her aid; and she flattered him into a
good humour; so, when Catherine came, half forgetting her former insults,
he tried to make himself agreeable, by the housekeeper's account.

'Missis walked in,' she said, 'as chill as an icicle, and as high as a
princess.  I got up and offered her my seat in the arm-chair.  No, she
turned up her nose at my civility.  Earnshaw rose, too, and bid her come
to the settle, and sit close by the fire: he was sure she was starved.

'"I've been starved a month and more," she answered, resting on the word
as scornful as she could.

'And she got a chair for herself, and placed it at a distance from both
of us.  Having sat till she was warm, she began to look round, and
discovered a number of books on the dresser; she was instantly upon her
feet again, stretching to reach them: but they were too high up.  Her
cousin, after watching her endeavours a while, at last summoned courage
to help her; she held her frock, and he filled it with the first that
came to hand.

'That was a great advance for the lad.  She didn't thank him; still, he
felt gratified that she had accepted his assistance, and ventured to
stand behind as she examined them, and even to stoop and point out what
struck his fancy in certain old pictures which they contained; nor was he
daunted by the saucy style in which she jerked the page from his finger:
he contented himself with going a bit farther back and looking at her
instead of the book.  She continued reading, or seeking for something to
read.  His attention became, by degrees, quite centred in the study of
her thick silky curls: her face he couldn't see, and she couldn't see
him.  And, perhaps, not quite awake to what he did, but attracted like a
child to a candle, at last he proceeded from staring to touching; he put
out his hand and stroked one curl, as gently as if it were a bird.  He
might have stuck a knife into her neck, she started round in such a
taking.

'"Get away this moment!  How dare you touch me?  Why are you stopping
there?" she cried, in a tone of disgust.  "I can't endure you!  I'll go
upstairs again, if you come near me."

'Mr. Hareton recoiled, looking as foolish as he could do: he sat down in
the settle very quiet, and she continued turning over her volumes another
half hour; finally, Earnshaw crossed over, and whispered to me.

'"Will you ask her to read to us, Zillah?  I'm stalled of doing naught;
and I do like--I could like to hear her!  Dunnot say I wanted it, but ask
of yourseln."

'"Mr. Hareton wishes you would read to us, ma'am," I said, immediately.
"He'd take it very kind--he'd be much obliged."

'She frowned; and looking up, answered--

'"Mr. Hareton, and the whole set of you, will be good enough to
understand that I reject any pretence at kindness you have the hypocrisy
to offer!  I despise you, and will have nothing to say to any of you!
When I would have given my life for one kind word, even to see one of
your faces, you all kept off.  But I won't complain to you!  I'm driven
down here by the cold; not either to amuse you or enjoy your society."

'"What could I ha' done?" began Earnshaw.  "How was I to blame?"

'"Oh! you are an exception," answered Mrs. Heathcliff.  "I never missed
such a concern as you."

'"But I offered more than once, and asked," he said, kindling up at her
pertness, "I asked Mr. Heathcliff to let me wake for you--"

'"Be silent!  I'll go out of doors, or anywhere, rather than have your
disagreeable voice in my ear!" said my lady.

'Hareton muttered she might go to hell, for him! and unslinging his gun,
restrained himself from his Sunday occupations no longer.  He talked now,
freely enough; and she presently saw fit to retreat to her solitude: but
the frost had set in, and, in spite of her pride, she was forced to
condescend to our company, more and more.  However, I took care there
should be no further scorning at my good nature: ever since, I've been as
stiff as herself; and she has no lover or liker among us: and she does
not deserve one; for, let them say the least word to her, and she'll curl
back without respect of any one.  She'll snap at the master himself, and
as good as dares him to thrash her; and the more hurt she gets, the more
venomous she grows.'

At first, on hearing this account from Zillah, I determined to leave my
situation, take a cottage, and get Catherine to come and live with me:
but Mr. Heathcliff would as soon permit that as he would set up Hareton
in an independent house; and I can see no remedy, at present, unless she
could marry again; and that scheme it does not come within my province to
arrange.

* * * * *

Thus ended Mrs. Dean's story.  Notwithstanding the doctor's prophecy, I
am rapidly recovering strength; and though it be only the second week in
January, I propose getting out on horseback in a day or two, and riding
over to Wuthering Heights, to inform my landlord that I shall spend the
next six months in London; and, if he likes, he may look out for another
tenant to take the place after October.  I would not pass another winter
here for much.




CHAPTER XXXI


Yesterday was bright, calm, and frosty.  I went to the Heights as I
proposed: my housekeeper entreated me to bear a little note from her to
her young lady, and I did not refuse, for the worthy woman was not
conscious of anything odd in her request.  The front door stood open, but
the jealous gate was fastened, as at my last visit; I knocked and invoked
Earnshaw from among the garden-beds; he unchained it, and I entered.  The
fellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen.  I took particular notice
of him this time; but then he does his best apparently to make the least
of his advantages.

I asked if Mr. Heathcliff were at home?  He answered, No; but he would be
in at dinner-time.  It was eleven o'clock, and I announced my intention
of going in and waiting for him; at which he immediately flung down his
tools and accompanied me, in the office of watchdog, not as a substitute
for the host.

We entered together; Catherine was there, making herself useful in
preparing some vegetables for the approaching meal; she looked more
sulky and less spirited than when I had seen her first. She hardly
raised her eyes to notice me, and continued her employment with the same
disregard to common forms of politeness as before; never returning my
bow and good-morning by the slightest acknowledgment.

'She does not seem so amiable,' I thought, 'as Mrs. Dean would persuade
me to believe.  She's a beauty, it is true; but not an angel.'

Earnshaw surlily bid her remove her things to the kitchen.  'Remove them
yourself,' she said, pushing them from her as soon as she had done; and
retiring to a stool by the window, where she began to carve figures of
birds and beasts out of the turnip-parings in her lap.  I approached her,
pretending to desire a view of the garden; and, as I fancied, adroitly
dropped Mrs. Dean's note on to her knee, unnoticed by Hareton--but she
asked aloud, 'What is that?'  And chucked it off.

'A letter from your old acquaintance, the housekeeper at the Grange,' I
answered; annoyed at her exposing my kind deed, and fearful lest it
should be imagined a missive of my own.  She would gladly have gathered
it up at this information, but Hareton beat her; he seized and put it in
his waistcoat, saying Mr. Heathcliff should look at it first.  Thereat,
Catherine silently turned her face from us, and, very stealthily, drew
out her pocket-handkerchief and applied it to her eyes; and her cousin,
after struggling awhile to keep down his softer feelings, pulled out the
letter and flung it on the floor beside her, as ungraciously as he could.
Catherine caught and perused it eagerly; then she put a few questions to
me concerning the inmates, rational and irrational, of her former home;
and gazing towards the hills, murmured in soliloquy:

'I should like to be riding Minny down there!  I should like to be
climbing up there!  Oh!  I'm tired--I'm _stalled_, Hareton!'  And she
leant her pretty head back against the sill, with half a yawn and half a
sigh, and lapsed into an aspect of abstracted sadness: neither caring nor
knowing whether we remarked her.

'Mrs. Heathcliff,' I said, after sitting some time mute, 'you are not
aware that I am an acquaintance of yours? so intimate that I think it
strange you won't come and speak to me.  My housekeeper never wearies of
talking about and praising you; and she'll be greatly disappointed if I
return with no news of or from you, except that you received her letter
and said nothing!'

She appeared to wonder at this speech, and asked,--

'Does Ellen like you?'

'Yes, very well,' I replied, hesitatingly.

'You must tell her,' she continued, 'that I would answer her letter, but
I have no materials for writing: not even a book from which I might tear
a leaf.'

'No books!' I exclaimed.  'How do you contrive to live here without them?
if I may take the liberty to inquire.  Though provided with a large
library, I'm frequently very dull at the Grange; take my books away, and
I should be desperate!'

'I was always reading, when I had them,' said Catherine; 'and Mr.
Heathcliff never reads; so he took it into his head to destroy my books.
I have not had a glimpse of one for weeks.  Only once, I searched through
Joseph's store of theology, to his great irritation; and once, Hareton, I
came upon a secret stock in your room--some Latin and Greek, and some
tales and poetry: all old friends.  I brought the last here--and you
gathered them, as a magpie gathers silver spoons, for the mere love of
stealing!  They are of no use to you; or else you concealed them in the
bad spirit that, as you cannot enjoy them, nobody else shall.  Perhaps
_your_ envy counselled Mr. Heathcliff to rob me of my treasures?  But
I've most of them written on my brain and printed in my heart, and you
cannot deprive me of those!'

Earnshaw blushed crimson when his cousin made this revelation of his
private literary accumulations, and stammered an indignant denial of her
accusations.

'Mr. Hareton is desirous of increasing his amount of knowledge,' I said,
coming to his rescue.  'He is not _envious_, but _emulous_ of your
attainments.  He'll be a clever scholar in a few years.'

'And he wants me to sink into a dunce, meantime,' answered Catherine.
'Yes, I hear him trying to spell and read to himself, and pretty blunders
he makes!  I wish you would repeat Chevy Chase as you did yesterday: it
was extremely funny.  I heard you; and I heard you turning over the
dictionary to seek out the hard words, and then cursing because you
couldn't read their explanations!'

The young man evidently thought it too bad that he should be laughed at
for his ignorance, and then laughed at for trying to remove it.  I had a
similar notion; and, remembering Mrs. Dean's anecdote of his first
attempt at enlightening the darkness in which he had been reared, I
observed,--'But, Mrs. Heathcliff, we have each had a commencement, and
each stumbled and tottered on the threshold; had our teachers scorned
instead of aiding us, we should stumble and totter yet.'

'Oh!' she replied, 'I don't wish to limit his acquirements: still, he has
no right to appropriate what is mine, and make it ridiculous to me with
his vile mistakes and mispronunciations!  Those books, both prose and
verse, are consecrated to me by other associations; and I hate to have
them debased and profaned in his mouth!  Besides, of all, he has selected
my favourite pieces that I love the most to repeat, as if out of
deliberate malice.'

Hareton's chest heaved in silence a minute: he laboured under a severe
sense of mortification and wrath, which it was no easy task to suppress.
I rose, and, from a gentlemanly idea of relieving his embarrassment, took
up my station in the doorway, surveying the external prospect as I stood.
He followed my example, and left the room; but presently reappeared,
bearing half a dozen volumes in his hands, which he threw into
Catherine's lap, exclaiming,--'Take them!  I never want to hear, or read,
or think of them again!'

'I won't have them now,' she answered.  'I shall connect them with you,
and hate them.'

She opened one that had obviously been often turned over, and read a
portion in the drawling tone of a beginner; then laughed, and threw it
from her.  'And listen,' she continued, provokingly, commencing a verse
of an old ballad in the same fashion.

But his self-love would endure no further torment: I heard, and not
altogether disapprovingly, a manual check given to her saucy tongue.  The
little wretch had done her utmost to hurt her cousin's sensitive though
uncultivated feelings, and a physical argument was the only mode he had
of balancing the account, and repaying its effects on the inflictor.  He
afterwards gathered the books and hurled them on the fire.  I read in his
countenance what anguish it was to offer that sacrifice to spleen.  I
fancied that as they consumed, he recalled the pleasure they had already
imparted, and the triumph and ever-increasing pleasure he had anticipated
from them; and I fancied I guessed the incitement to his secret studies
also.  He had been content with daily labour and rough animal enjoyments,
till Catherine crossed his path.  Shame at her scorn, and hope of her
approval, were his first prompters to higher pursuits; and instead of
guarding him from one and winning him to the other, his endeavours to
raise himself had produced just the contrary result.

'Yes that's all the good that such a brute as you can get from them!'
cried Catherine, sucking her damaged lip, and watching the conflagration
with indignant eyes.

'You'd _better_ hold your tongue, now,' he answered fiercely.

And his agitation precluded further speech; he advanced hastily to the
entrance, where I made way for him to pass.  But ere he had crossed the
door-stones, Mr. Heathcliff, coming up the causeway, encountered him, and
laying hold of his shoulder asked,--'What's to do now, my lad?'

'Naught, naught,' he said, and broke away to enjoy his grief and anger in
solitude.

Heathcliff gazed after him, and sighed.

'It will be odd if I thwart myself,' he muttered, unconscious that I was
behind him.  'But when I look for his father in his face, I find _her_
every day more!  How the devil is he so like?  I can hardly bear to see
him.'

He bent his eyes to the ground, and walked moodily in.  There was a
restless, anxious expression in his countenance.  I had never remarked
there before; and he looked sparer in person.  His daughter-in-law, on
perceiving him through the window, immediately escaped to the kitchen, so
that I remained alone.

'I'm glad to see you out of doors again, Mr. Lockwood,' he said, in reply
to my greeting; 'from selfish motives partly: I don't think I could
readily supply your loss in this desolation.  I've wondered more than
once what brought you here.'

'An idle whim, I fear, sir,' was my answer; 'or else an idle whim is
going to spirit me away.  I shall set out for London next week; and I
must give you warning that I feel no disposition to retain Thrushcross
Grange beyond the twelve months I agreed to rent it.  I believe I shall
not live there any more.'

'Oh, indeed; you're tired of being banished from the world, are you?' he
said.  'But if you be coming to plead off paying for a place you won't
occupy, your journey is useless: I never relent in exacting my due from
any one.'

'I'm coming to plead off nothing about it,' I exclaimed, considerably
irritated.  'Should you wish it, I'll settle with you now,' and I drew my
note-book from my pocket.

'No, no,' he replied, coolly; 'you'll leave sufficient behind to cover
your debts, if you fail to return: I'm not in such a hurry.  Sit down and
take your dinner with us; a guest that is safe from repeating his visit
can generally be made welcome.  Catherine! bring the things in: where are
you?'

Catherine reappeared, bearing a tray of knives and forks.

'You may get your dinner with Joseph,' muttered Heathcliff, aside, 'and
remain in the kitchen till he is gone.'

She obeyed his directions very punctually: perhaps she had no temptation
to transgress.  Living among clowns and misanthropists, she probably
cannot appreciate a better class of people when she meets them.

With Mr. Heathcliff, grim and saturnine, on the one hand, and Hareton,
absolutely dumb, on the other, I made a somewhat cheerless meal, and bade
adieu early.  I would have departed by the back way, to get a last
glimpse of Catherine and annoy old Joseph; but Hareton received orders to
lead up my horse, and my host himself escorted me to the door, so I could
not fulfil my wish.

'How dreary life gets over in that house!' I reflected, while riding down
the road.  'What a realisation of something more romantic than a fairy
tale it would have been for Mrs. Linton Heathcliff, had she and I struck
up an attachment, as her good nurse desired, and migrated together into
the stirring atmosphere of the town!'




CHAPTER XXXII


1802.--This September I was invited to devastate the moors of a friend in
the north, and on my journey to his abode, I unexpectedly came within
fifteen miles of Gimmerton.  The ostler at a roadside public-house was
holding a pail of water to refresh my horses, when a cart of very green
oats, newly reaped, passed by, and he remarked,--'Yon's frough Gimmerton,
nah!  They're allas three wick' after other folk wi' ther harvest.'

'Gimmerton?' I repeated--my residence in that locality had already grown
dim and dreamy.  'Ah!  I know.  How far is it from this?'

'Happen fourteen mile o'er th' hills; and a rough road,' he answered.

A sudden impulse seized me to visit Thrushcross Grange.  It was scarcely
noon, and I conceived that I might as well pass the night under my own
roof as in an inn.  Besides, I could spare a day easily to arrange
matters with my landlord, and thus save myself the trouble of invading
the neighbourhood again.  Having rested awhile, I directed my servant to
inquire the way to the village; and, with great fatigue to our beasts, we
managed the distance in some three hours.

I left him there, and proceeded down the valley alone.  The grey church
looked greyer, and the lonely churchyard lonelier.  I distinguished a
moor-sheep cropping the short turf on the graves.  It was sweet, warm
weather--too warm for travelling; but the heat did not hinder me from
enjoying the delightful scenery above and below: had I seen it nearer
August, I'm sure it would have tempted me to waste a month among its
solitudes.  In winter nothing more dreary, in summer nothing more divine,
than those glens shut in by hills, and those bluff, bold swells of heath.

I reached the Grange before sunset, and knocked for admittance; but the
family had retreated into the back premises, I judged, by one thin, blue
wreath, curling from the kitchen chimney, and they did not hear.  I rode
into the court.  Under the porch, a girl of nine or ten sat knitting, and
an old woman reclined on the housesteps, smoking a meditative pipe.

'Is Mrs. Dean within?' I demanded of the dame.

'Mistress Dean?  Nay!' she answered, 'she doesn't bide here: shoo's up at
th' Heights.'

'Are you the housekeeper, then?' I continued.

'Eea, aw keep th' hause,' she replied.

'Well, I'm Mr. Lockwood, the master.  Are there any rooms to lodge me in,
I wonder?  I wish to stay all night.'

'T' maister!' she cried in astonishment.  'Whet, whoiver knew yah wur
coming?  Yah sud ha' send word.  They's nowt norther dry nor mensful
abaht t' place: nowt there isn't!'

She threw down her pipe and bustled in, the girl followed, and I entered
too; soon perceiving that her report was true, and, moreover, that I had
almost upset her wits by my unwelcome apparition, I bade her be composed.
I would go out for a walk; and, meantime she must try to prepare a corner
of a sitting-room for me to sup in, and a bedroom to sleep in.  No
sweeping and dusting, only good fire and dry sheets were necessary.  She
seemed willing to do her best; though she thrust the hearth-brush into
the grates in mistake for the poker, and malappropriated several other
articles of her craft: but I retired, confiding in her energy for a
resting-place against my return.  Wuthering Heights was the goal of my
proposed excursion.  An afterthought brought me back, when I had quitted
the court.

'All well at the Heights?' I inquired of the woman.

'Eea, f'r owt ee knaw!' she answered, skurrying away with a pan of hot
cinders.

I would have asked why Mrs. Dean had deserted the Grange, but it was
impossible to delay her at such a crisis, so I turned away and made my
exit, rambling leisurely along, with the glow of a sinking sun behind,
and the mild glory of a rising moon in front--one fading, and the other
brightening--as I quitted the park, and climbed the stony by-road
branching off to Mr. Heathcliff's dwelling.  Before I arrived in sight of
it, all that remained of day was a beamless amber light along the west:
but I could see every pebble on the path, and every blade of grass, by
that splendid moon.  I had neither to climb the gate nor to knock--it
yielded to my hand.  That is an improvement, I thought.  And I noticed
another, by the aid of my nostrils; a fragrance of stocks and wallflowers
wafted on the air from amongst the homely fruit-trees.

Both doors and lattices were open; and yet, as is usually the case in a
coal-district, a fine red fire illumined the chimney: the comfort which
the eye derives from it renders the extra heat endurable.  But the house
of Wuthering Heights is so large that the inmates have plenty of space
for withdrawing out of its influence; and accordingly what inmates there
were had stationed themselves not far from one of the windows.  I could
both see them and hear them talk before I entered, and looked and
listened in consequence; being moved thereto by a mingled sense of
curiosity and envy, that grew as I lingered.

'Con-_trary_!' said a voice as sweet as a silver bell.  'That for the
third time, you dunce!  I'm not going to tell you again. Recollect, or
I'll pull your hair!'

'Contrary, then,' answered another, in deep but softened tones. 'And now,
kiss me, for minding so well.'

'No, read it over first correctly, without a single mistake.'

The male speaker began to read: he was a young man, respectably dressed
and seated at a table, having a book before him.  His handsome features
glowed with pleasure, and his eyes kept impatiently wandering from the
page to a small white hand over his shoulder, which recalled him by a
smart slap on the cheek, whenever its owner detected such signs of
inattention.  Its owner stood behind; her light, shining ringlets
blending, at intervals, with his brown looks, as she bent to superintend
his studies; and her face--it was lucky he could not see her face, or he
would never have been so steady.  I could; and I bit my lip in spite, at
having thrown away the chance I might have had of doing something besides
staring at its smiting beauty.

The task was done, not free from further blunders; but the pupil claimed
a reward, and received at least five kisses; which, however, he
generously returned.  Then they came to the door, and from their
conversation I judged they were about to issue out and have a walk on the
moors.  I supposed I should be condemned in Hareton Earnshaw's heart, if
not by his mouth, to the lowest pit in the infernal regions if I showed
my unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then; and feeling very mean
and malignant, I skulked round to seek refuge in the kitchen.  There was
unobstructed admittance on that side also; and at the door sat my old
friend Nelly Dean, sewing and singing a song; which was often interrupted
from within by harsh words of scorn and intolerance, uttered in far from
musical accents.

'I'd rayther, by th' haulf, hev' 'em swearing i' my lugs fro'h morn to
neeght, nor hearken ye hahsiver!' said the tenant of the kitchen, in
answer to an unheard speech of Nelly's.  'It's a blazing shame, that I
cannot oppen t' blessed Book, but yah set up them glories to sattan, and
all t' flaysome wickednesses that iver were born into th' warld!  Oh!
ye're a raight nowt; and shoo's another; and that poor lad 'll be lost
atween ye.  Poor lad!' he added, with a groan; 'he's witched: I'm sartin
on't.  Oh, Lord, judge 'em, for there's norther law nor justice among wer
rullers!'

'No! or we should be sitting in flaming fagots, I suppose,' retorted the
singer.  'But wisht, old man, and read your Bible like a Christian, and
never mind me.  This is "Fairy Annie's Wedding"--a bonny tune--it goes to
a dance.'

Mrs. Dean was about to recommence, when I advanced; and recognising me
directly, she jumped to her feet, crying--'Why, bless you, Mr. Lockwood!
How could you think of returning in this way?  All's shut up at
Thrushcross Grange.  You should have given us notice!'

'I've arranged to be accommodated there, for as long as I shall stay,' I
answered.  'I depart again to-morrow.  And how are you transplanted here,
Mrs. Dean? tell me that.'

'Zillah left, and Mr. Heathcliff wished me to come, soon after you went
to London, and stay till you returned.  But, step in, pray! Have you
walked from Gimmerton this evening?'

'From the Grange,' I replied; 'and while they make me lodging room there,
I want to finish my business with your master; because I don't think of
having another opportunity in a hurry.'

'What business, sir?' said Nelly, conducting me into the house. 'He's
gone out at present, and won't return soon.'

'About the rent,' I answered.

'Oh! then it is with Mrs. Heathcliff you must settle,' she observed; 'or
rather with me.  She has not learnt to manage her affairs yet, and I act
for her: there's nobody else.'

I looked surprised.

'Ah! you have not heard of Heathcliff's death, I see,' she continued.

'Heathcliff dead!' I exclaimed, astonished.  'How long ago?'

'Three months since: but sit down, and let me take your hat, and I'll
tell you all about it.  Stop, you have had nothing to eat, have you?'

'I want nothing: I have ordered supper at home.  You sit down too. I
never dreamt of his dying!  Let me hear how it came to pass.  You say you
don't expect them back for some time--the young people?'

'No--I have to scold them every evening for their late rambles: but they
don't care for me.  At least, have a drink of our old ale; it will do you
good: you seem weary.'

She hastened to fetch it before I could refuse, and I heard Joseph asking
whether 'it warn't a crying scandal that she should have followers at her
time of life?  And then, to get them jocks out o' t' maister's cellar!  He
fair shaamed to 'bide still and see it.'

She did not stay to retaliate, but re-entered in a minute, bearing a
reaming silver pint, whose contents I lauded with becoming earnestness.
And afterwards she furnished me with the sequel of Heathcliff's history.
He had a 'queer' end, as she expressed it.

I was summoned to Wuthering Heights, within a fortnight of your leaving
us, she said; and I obeyed joyfully, for Catherine's sake. My first
interview with her grieved and shocked me: she had altered so much since
our separation.  Mr. Heathcliff did not explain his reasons for taking a
new mind about my coming here; he only told me he wanted me, and he was
tired of seeing Catherine: I must make the little parlour my
sitting-room, and keep her with me. It was enough if he were obliged to
see her once or twice a day. She seemed pleased at this arrangement; and,
by degrees, I smuggled over a great number of books, and other articles,
that had formed her amusement at the Grange; and flattered myself we
should get on in tolerable comfort.  The delusion did not last long.
Catherine, contented at first, in a brief space grew irritable and
restless. For one thing, she was forbidden to move out of the garden, and
it fretted her sadly to be confined to its narrow bounds as spring drew
on; for another, in following the house, I was forced to quit her
frequently, and she complained of loneliness: she preferred quarrelling
with Joseph in the kitchen to sitting at peace in her solitude.  I did
not mind their skirmishes: but Hareton was often obliged to seek the
kitchen also, when the master wanted to have the house to himself! and
though in the beginning she either left it at his approach, or quietly
joined in my occupations, and shunned remarking or addressing him--and
though he was always as sullen and silent as possible--after a while, she
changed her behaviour, and became incapable of letting him alone: talking
at him; commenting on his stupidity and idleness; expressing her wonder
how he could endure the life he lived--how he could sit a whole evening
staring into the fire, and dozing.

'He's just like a dog, is he not, Ellen?' she once observed, 'or a
cart-horse? He does his work, eats his food, and sleeps eternally! What
a blank, dreary mind he must have! Do you ever dream, Hareton? And, if
you do, what is it about? But you can't speak to me!'

Then she looked at him; but he would neither open his mouth nor look
again.

'He's, perhaps, dreaming now,' she continued.  'He twitched his shoulder
as Juno twitches hers.  Ask him, Ellen.'

'Mr. Hareton will ask the master to send you up-stairs, if you don't
behave!' I said.  He had not only twitched his shoulder but clenched his
fist, as if tempted to use it.

'I know why Hareton never speaks, when I am in the kitchen,' she
exclaimed, on another occasion.  'He is afraid I shall laugh at him.
Ellen, what do you think?  He began to teach himself to read once; and,
because I laughed, he burned his books, and dropped it: was he not a
fool?'

'Were not you naughty?' I said; 'answer me that.'

'Perhaps I was,' she went on; 'but I did not expect him to be so silly.
Hareton, if I gave you a book, would you take it now?  I'll try!'

She placed one she had been perusing on his hand; he flung it off, and
muttered, if she did not give over, he would break her neck.

'Well, I shall put it here,' she said, 'in the table-drawer; and I'm
going to bed.'

Then she whispered me to watch whether he touched it, and departed.  But
he would not come near it; and so I informed her in the morning, to her
great disappointment.  I saw she was sorry for his persevering sulkiness
and indolence: her conscience reproved her for frightening him off
improving himself: she had done it effectually.  But her ingenuity was at
work to remedy the injury: while I ironed, or pursued other such
stationary employments as I could not well do in the parlour, she would
bring some pleasant volume and read it aloud to me.  When Hareton was
there, she generally paused in an interesting part, and left the book
lying about: that she did repeatedly; but he was as obstinate as a mule,
and, instead of snatching at her bait, in wet weather he took to smoking
with Joseph; and they sat like automatons, one on each side of the fire,
the elder happily too deaf to understand her wicked nonsense, as he would
have called it, the younger doing his best to seem to disregard it.  On
fine evenings the latter followed his shooting expeditions, and Catherine
yawned and sighed, and teased me to talk to her, and ran off into the
court or garden the moment I began; and, as a last resource, cried, and
said she was tired of living: her life was useless.

Mr. Heathcliff, who grew more and more disinclined to society, had almost
banished Earnshaw from his apartment.  Owing to an accident at the
commencement of March, he became for some days a fixture in the kitchen.
His gun burst while out on the hills by himself; a splinter cut his arm,
and he lost a good deal of blood before he could reach home.  The
consequence was that, perforce, he was condemned to the fireside and
tranquillity, till he made it up again.  It suited Catherine to have him
there: at any rate, it made her hate her room up-stairs more than ever:
and she would compel me to find out business below, that she might
accompany me.

On Easter Monday, Joseph went to Gimmerton fair with some cattle; and, in
the afternoon, I was busy getting up linen in the kitchen.  Earnshaw sat,
morose as usual, at the chimney corner, and my little mistress was
beguiling an idle hour with drawing pictures on the window-panes, varying
her amusement by smothered bursts of songs, and whispered ejaculations,
and quick glances of annoyance and impatience in the direction of her
cousin, who steadfastly smoked, and looked into the grate.  At a notice
that I could do with her no longer intercepting my light, she removed to
the hearthstone.  I bestowed little attention on her proceedings, but,
presently, I heard her begin--'I've found out, Hareton, that I want--that
I'm glad--that I should like you to be my cousin now, if you had not
grown so cross to me, and so rough.'

Hareton returned no answer.

'Hareton, Hareton, Hareton! do you hear?' she continued.

'Get off wi' ye!' he growled, with uncompromising gruffness.

'Let me take that pipe,' she said, cautiously advancing her hand and
abstracting it from his mouth.

Before he could attempt to recover it, it was broken, and behind the
fire.  He swore at her and seized another.

'Stop,' she cried, 'you must listen to me first; and I can't speak while
those clouds are floating in my face.'

'Will you go to the devil!' he exclaimed, ferociously, 'and let me be!'

'No,' she persisted, 'I won't: I can't tell what to do to make you talk
to me; and you are determined not to understand.  When I call you stupid,
I don't mean anything: I don't mean that I despise you.  Come, you shall
take notice of me, Hareton: you are my cousin, and you shall own me.'

'I shall have naught to do wi' you and your mucky pride, and your damned
mocking tricks!' he answered.  'I'll go to hell, body and soul, before I
look sideways after you again.  Side out o' t' gate, now, this minute!'

Catherine frowned, and retreated to the window-seat chewing her lip, and
endeavouring, by humming an eccentric tune, to conceal a growing tendency
to sob.

'You should be friends with your cousin, Mr. Hareton,' I interrupted,
'since she repents of her sauciness.  It would do you a great deal of
good: it would make you another man to have her for a companion.'

'A companion!' he cried; 'when she hates me, and does not think me fit to
wipe her shoon!  Nay, if it made me a king, I'd not be scorned for
seeking her good-will any more.'

'It is not I who hate you, it is you who hate me!' wept Cathy, no longer
disguising her trouble.  'You hate me as much as Mr. Heathcliff does, and
more.'

'You're a damned liar,' began Earnshaw: 'why have I made him angry, by
taking your part, then, a hundred times? and that when you sneered at and
despised me, and--Go on plaguing me, and I'll step in yonder, and say you
worried me out of the kitchen!'

'I didn't know you took my part,' she answered, drying her eyes; 'and I
was miserable and bitter at everybody; but now I thank you, and beg you
to forgive me: what can I do besides?'

She returned to the hearth, and frankly extended her hand.  He blackened
and scowled like a thunder-cloud, and kept his fists resolutely clenched,
and his gaze fixed on the ground.  Catherine, by instinct, must have
divined it was obdurate perversity, and not dislike, that prompted this
dogged conduct; for, after remaining an instant undecided, she stooped
and impressed on his cheek a gentle kiss.  The little rogue thought I had
not seen her, and, drawing back, she took her former station by the
window, quite demurely.  I shook my head reprovingly, and then she
blushed and whispered--'Well! what should I have done, Ellen?  He
wouldn't shake hands, and he wouldn't look: I must show him some way that
I like him--that I want to be friends.'

Whether the kiss convinced Hareton, I cannot tell: he was very careful,
for some minutes, that his face should not be seen, and when he did raise
it, he was sadly puzzled where to turn his eyes.

Catherine employed herself in wrapping a handsome book neatly in white
paper, and having tied it with a bit of ribbon, and addressed it to 'Mr.
Hareton Earnshaw,' she desired me to be her ambassadress, and convey the
present to its destined recipient.

'And tell him, if he'll take it, I'll come and teach him to read it
right,' she said; 'and, if he refuse it, I'll go upstairs, and never
tease him again.'

I carried it, and repeated the message; anxiously watched by my employer.
Hareton would not open his fingers, so I laid it on his knee.  He did not
strike it off, either.  I returned to my work.  Catherine leaned her head
and arms on the table, till she heard the slight rustle of the covering
being removed; then she stole away, and quietly seated herself beside her
cousin.  He trembled, and his face glowed: all his rudeness and all his
surly harshness had deserted him: he could not summon courage, at first,
to utter a syllable in reply to her questioning look, and her murmured
petition.

'Say you forgive me, Hareton, do.  You can make me so happy by speaking
that little word.'

He muttered something inaudible.

'And you'll be my friend?' added Catherine, interrogatively.

'Nay, you'll be ashamed of me every day of your life,' he answered; 'and
the more ashamed, the more you know me; and I cannot bide it.'

'So you won't be my friend?' she said, smiling as sweet as honey, and
creeping close up.

I overheard no further distinguishable talk, but, on looking round again,
I perceived two such radiant countenances bent over the page of the
accepted book, that I did not doubt the treaty had been ratified on both
sides; and the enemies were, thenceforth, sworn allies.

The work they studied was full of costly pictures; and those and their
position had charm enough to keep them unmoved till Joseph came home.  He,
poor man, was perfectly aghast at the spectacle of Catherine seated on
the same bench with Hareton Earnshaw, leaning her hand on his shoulder;
and confounded at his favourite's endurance of her proximity: it affected
him too deeply to allow an observation on the subject that night.  His
emotion was only revealed by the immense sighs he drew, as he solemnly
spread his large Bible on the table, and overlaid it with dirty
bank-notes from his pocket-book, the produce of the day's transactions.
At length he summoned Hareton from his seat.

'Tak' these in to t' maister, lad,' he said, 'and bide there.  I's gang
up to my own rahm.  This hoile's neither mensful nor seemly for us: we
mun side out and seearch another.'

'Come, Catherine,' I said, 'we must "side out" too: I've done my ironing.
Are you ready to go?'

'It is not eight o'clock!' she answered, rising unwillingly.

'Hareton, I'll leave this book upon the chimney-piece, and I'll bring
some more to-morrow.'

'Ony books that yah leave, I shall tak' into th' hahse,' said Joseph,
'and it'll be mitch if yah find 'em agean; soa, yah may plase yerseln!'

Cathy threatened that his library should pay for hers; and, smiling as
she passed Hareton, went singing up-stairs: lighter of heart, I venture
to say, than ever she had been under that roof before; except, perhaps,
during her earliest visits to Linton.

The intimacy thus commenced grew rapidly; though it encountered temporary
interruptions.  Earnshaw was not to be civilized with a wish, and my
young lady was no philosopher, and no paragon of patience; but both their
minds tending to the same point--one loving and desiring to esteem, and
the other loving and desiring to be esteemed--they contrived in the end
to reach it.

You see, Mr. Lockwood, it was easy enough to win Mrs. Heathcliff's heart.
But now, I'm glad you did not try.  The crown of all my wishes will be
the union of those two.  I shall envy no one on their wedding day: there
won't be a happier woman than myself in England!




CHAPTER XXXIII


On the morrow of that Monday, Earnshaw being still unable to follow his
ordinary employments, and therefore remaining about the house, I speedily
found it would be impracticable to retain my charge beside me, as
heretofore.  She got downstairs before me, and out into the garden, where
she had seen her cousin performing some easy work; and when I went to bid
them come to breakfast, I saw she had persuaded him to clear a large
space of ground from currant and gooseberry bushes, and they were busy
planning together an importation of plants from the Grange.

I was terrified at the devastation which had been accomplished in a brief
half-hour; the black-currant trees were the apple of Joseph's eye, and
she had just fixed her choice of a flower-bed in the midst of them.

'There!  That will be all shown to the master,' I exclaimed, 'the minute
it is discovered.  And what excuse have you to offer for taking such
liberties with the garden?  We shall have a fine explosion on the head of
it: see if we don't!  Mr. Hareton, I wonder you should have no more wit
than to go and make that mess at her bidding!'

'I'd forgotten they were Joseph's,' answered Earnshaw, rather puzzled;
'but I'll tell him I did it.'

We always ate our meals with Mr. Heathcliff.  I held the mistress's post
in making tea and carving; so I was indispensable at table.  Catherine
usually sat by me, but to-day she stole nearer to Hareton; and I
presently saw she would have no more discretion in her friendship than
she had in her hostility.

'Now, mind you don't talk with and notice your cousin too much,' were my
whispered instructions as we entered the room.  'It will certainly annoy
Mr. Heathcliff, and he'll be mad at you both.'

'I'm not going to,' she answered.

The minute after, she had sidled to him, and was sticking primroses in
his plate of porridge.

He dared not speak to her there: he dared hardly look; and yet she went
on teasing, till he was twice on the point of being provoked to laugh.  I
frowned, and then she glanced towards the master: whose mind was occupied
on other subjects than his company, as his countenance evinced; and she
grew serious for an instant, scrutinizing him with deep gravity.
Afterwards she turned, and recommenced her nonsense; at last, Hareton
uttered a smothered laugh.  Mr. Heathcliff started; his eye rapidly
surveyed our faces, Catherine met it with her accustomed look of
nervousness and yet defiance, which he abhorred.

'It is well you are out of my reach,' he exclaimed.  'What fiend
possesses you to stare back at me, continually, with those infernal eyes?
Down with them! and don't remind me of your existence again.  I thought I
had cured you of laughing.'

'It was me,' muttered Hareton.

'What do you say?' demanded the master.

Hareton looked at his plate, and did not repeat the confession.  Mr.
Heathcliff looked at him a bit, and then silently resumed his breakfast
and his interrupted musing.  We had nearly finished, and the two young
people prudently shifted wider asunder, so I anticipated no further
disturbance during that sitting: when Joseph appeared at the door,
revealing by his quivering lip and furious eyes that the outrage
committed on his precious shrubs was detected.  He must have seen Cathy
and her cousin about the spot before he examined it, for while his jaws
worked like those of a cow chewing its cud, and rendered his speech
difficult to understand, he began:--

'I mun hev' my wage, and I mun goa!  I _hed_ aimed to dee wheare I'd
sarved fur sixty year; and I thowt I'd lug my books up into t' garret,
and all my bits o' stuff, and they sud hev' t' kitchen to theirseln; for
t' sake o' quietness.  It wur hard to gie up my awn hearthstun, but I
thowt I _could_ do that!  But nah, shoo's taan my garden fro' me, and by
th' heart, maister, I cannot stand it!  Yah may bend to th' yoak an ye
will--I noan used to 't, and an old man doesn't sooin get used to new
barthens.  I'd rayther arn my bite an' my sup wi' a hammer in th' road!'

'Now, now, idiot!' interrupted Heathcliff, 'cut it short!  What's your
grievance?  I'll interfere in no quarrels between you and Nelly.  She may
thrust you into the coal-hole for anything I care.'

'It's noan Nelly!' answered Joseph.  'I sudn't shift for Nelly--nasty ill
nowt as shoo is.  Thank God! _shoo_ cannot stale t' sowl o' nob'dy!  Shoo
wer niver soa handsome, but what a body mud look at her 'bout winking.
It's yon flaysome, graceless quean, that's witched our lad, wi' her bold
een and her forrard ways--till--Nay! it fair brusts my heart!  He's
forgotten all I've done for him, and made on him, and goan and riven up a
whole row o' t' grandest currant-trees i' t' garden!' and here he
lamented outright; unmanned by a sense of his bitter injuries, and
Earnshaw's ingratitude and dangerous condition.

'Is the fool drunk?' asked Mr. Heathcliff.  'Hareton, is it you he's
finding fault with?'

'I've pulled up two or three bushes,' replied the young man; 'but I'm
going to set 'em again.'

'And why have you pulled them up?' said the master.

Catherine wisely put in her tongue.

'We wanted to plant some flowers there,' she cried.  'I'm the only person
to blame, for I wished him to do it.'

'And who the devil gave _you_ leave to touch a stick about the place?'
demanded her father-in-law, much surprised.  'And who ordered _you_ to
obey her?' he added, turning to Hareton.

The latter was speechless; his cousin replied--'You shouldn't grudge a
few yards of earth for me to ornament, when you have taken all my land!'

'Your land, insolent slut!  You never had any,' said Heathcliff.

'And my money,' she continued; returning his angry glare, and meantime
biting a piece of crust, the remnant of her breakfast.

'Silence!' he exclaimed.  'Get done, and begone!'

'And Hareton's land, and his money,' pursued the reckless thing.  'Hareton
and I are friends now; and I shall tell him all about you!'

The master seemed confounded a moment: he grew pale, and rose up, eyeing
her all the while, with an expression of mortal hate.

'If you strike me, Hareton will strike you,' she said; 'so you may as
well sit down.'

'If Hareton does not turn you out of the room, I'll strike him to hell,'
thundered Heathcliff.  'Damnable witch! dare you pretend to rouse him
against me?  Off with her!  Do you hear?  Fling her into the kitchen!
I'll kill her, Ellen Dean, if you let her come into my sight again!'

Hareton tried, under his breath, to persuade her to go.

'Drag her away!' he cried, savagely.  'Are you staying to talk?'  And he
approached to execute his own command.

'He'll not obey you, wicked man, any more,' said Catherine; 'and he'll
soon detest you as much as I do.'

'Wisht! wisht!' muttered the young man, reproachfully; 'I will not hear
you speak so to him.  Have done.'

'But you won't let him strike me?' she cried.

'Come, then,' he whispered earnestly.

It was too late: Heathcliff had caught hold of her.

'Now, _you_ go!' he said to Earnshaw.  'Accursed witch! this time she has
provoked me when I could not bear it; and I'll make her repent it for
ever!'

He had his hand in her hair; Hareton attempted to release her locks,
entreating him not to hurt her that once.  Heathcliff's black eyes
flashed; he seemed ready to tear Catherine in pieces, and I was just
worked up to risk coming to the rescue, when of a sudden his fingers
relaxed; he shifted his grasp from her head to her arm, and gazed
intently in her face.  Then he drew his hand over his eyes, stood a
moment to collect himself apparently, and turning anew to Catherine,
said, with assumed calmness--'You must learn to avoid putting me in a
passion, or I shall really murder you some time!  Go with Mrs. Dean, and
keep with her; and confine your insolence to her ears.  As to Hareton
Earnshaw, if I see him listen to you, I'll send him seeking his bread
where he can get it!  Your love will make him an outcast and a beggar.
Nelly, take her; and leave me, all of you!  Leave me!'

I led my young lady out: she was too glad of her escape to resist; the
other followed, and Mr. Heathcliff had the room to himself till dinner.  I
had counselled Catherine to dine up-stairs; but, as soon as he perceived
her vacant seat, he sent me to call her.  He spoke to none of us, ate
very little, and went out directly afterwards, intimating that he should
not return before evening.

The two new friends established themselves in the house during his
absence; where I heard Hareton sternly check his cousin, on her offering
a revelation of her father-in-law's conduct to his father.  He said he
wouldn't suffer a word to be uttered in his disparagement: if he were the
devil, it didn't signify; he would stand by him; and he'd rather she
would abuse himself, as she used to, than begin on Mr. Heathcliff.
Catherine was waxing cross at this; but he found means to make her hold
her tongue, by asking how she would like _him_ to speak ill of her
father?  Then she comprehended that Earnshaw took the master's reputation
home to himself; and was attached by ties stronger than reason could
break--chains, forged by habit, which it would be cruel to attempt to
loosen.  She showed a good heart, thenceforth, in avoiding both
complaints and expressions of antipathy concerning Heathcliff; and
confessed to me her sorrow that she had endeavoured to raise a bad spirit
between him and Hareton: indeed, I don't believe she has ever breathed a
syllable, in the latter's hearing, against her oppressor since.

When this slight disagreement was over, they were friends again, and as
busy as possible in their several occupations of pupil and teacher.  I
came in to sit with them, after I had done my work; and I felt so soothed
and comforted to watch them, that I did not notice how time got on.  You
know, they both appeared in a measure my children: I had long been proud
of one; and now, I was sure, the other would be a source of equal
satisfaction.  His honest, warm, and intelligent nature shook off rapidly
the clouds of ignorance and degradation in which it had been bred; and
Catherine's sincere commendations acted as a spur to his industry.  His
brightening mind brightened his features, and added spirit and nobility
to their aspect: I could hardly fancy it the same individual I had beheld
on the day I discovered my little lady at Wuthering Heights, after her
expedition to the Crags.  While I admired and they laboured, dusk drew
on, and with it returned the master.  He came upon us quite unexpectedly,
entering by the front way, and had a full view of the whole three, ere we
could raise our heads to glance at him.  Well, I reflected, there was
never a pleasanter, or more harmless sight; and it will be a burning
shame to scold them.  The red fire-light glowed on their two bonny heads,
and revealed their faces animated with the eager interest of children;
for, though he was twenty-three and she eighteen, each had so much of
novelty to feel and learn, that neither experienced nor evinced the
sentiments of sober disenchanted maturity.

They lifted their eyes together, to encounter Mr. Heathcliff: perhaps you
have never remarked that their eyes are precisely similar, and they are
those of Catherine Earnshaw.  The present Catherine has no other likeness
to her, except a breadth of forehead, and a certain arch of the nostril
that makes her appear rather haughty, whether she will or not.  With
Hareton the resemblance is carried farther: it is singular at all times,
_then_ it was particularly striking; because his senses were alert, and
his mental faculties wakened to unwonted activity.  I suppose this
resemblance disarmed Mr. Heathcliff: he walked to the hearth in evident
agitation; but it quickly subsided as he looked at the young man: or, I
should say, altered its character; for it was there yet.  He took the
book from his hand, and glanced at the open page, then returned it
without any observation; merely signing Catherine away: her companion
lingered very little behind her, and I was about to depart also, but he
bid me sit still.

'It is a poor conclusion, is it not?' he observed, having brooded awhile
on the scene he had just witnessed: 'an absurd termination to my violent
exertions?  I get levers and mattocks to demolish the two houses, and
train myself to be capable of working like Hercules, and when everything
is ready and in my power, I find the will to lift a slate off either roof
has vanished!  My old enemies have not beaten me; now would be the
precise time to revenge myself on their representatives: I could do it;
and none could hinder me.  But where is the use?  I don't care for
striking: I can't take the trouble to raise my hand!  That sounds as if I
had been labouring the whole time only to exhibit a fine trait of
magnanimity.  It is far from being the case: I have lost the faculty of
enjoying their destruction, and I am too idle to destroy for nothing.

'Nelly, there is a strange change approaching; I'm in its shadow at
present.  I take so little interest in my daily life that I hardly
remember to eat and drink.  Those two who have left the room are the only
objects which retain a distinct material appearance to me; and that
appearance causes me pain, amounting to agony.  About _her_ I won't
speak; and I don't desire to think; but I earnestly wish she were
invisible: her presence invokes only maddening sensations.  _He_ moves me
differently: and yet if I could do it without seeming insane, I'd never
see him again!  You'll perhaps think me rather inclined to become so,' he
added, making an effort to smile, 'if I try to describe the thousand
forms of past associations and ideas he awakens or embodies.  But you'll
not talk of what I tell you; and my mind is so eternally secluded in
itself, it is tempting at last to turn it out to another.

'Five minutes ago Hareton seemed a personification of my youth, not a
human being; I felt to him in such a variety of ways, that it would have
been impossible to have accosted him rationally.  In the first place, his
startling likeness to Catherine connected him fearfully with her.  That,
however, which you may suppose the most potent to arrest my imagination,
is actually the least: for what is not connected with her to me? and what
does not recall her?  I cannot look down to this floor, but her features
are shaped in the flags!  In every cloud, in every tree--filling the air
at night, and caught by glimpses in every object by day--I am surrounded
with her image!  The most ordinary faces of men and women--my own
features--mock me with a resemblance.  The entire world is a dreadful
collection of memoranda that she did exist, and that I have lost her!
Well, Hareton's aspect was the ghost of my immortal love; of my wild
endeavours to hold my right; my degradation, my pride, my happiness, and
my anguish--

'But it is frenzy to repeat these thoughts to you: only it will let you
know why, with a reluctance to be always alone, his society is no
benefit; rather an aggravation of the constant torment I suffer: and it
partly contributes to render me regardless how he and his cousin go on
together.  I can give them no attention any more.'

'But what do you mean by a _change_, Mr. Heathcliff?' I said, alarmed at
his manner: though he was neither in danger of losing his senses, nor
dying, according to my judgment: he was quite strong and healthy; and, as
to his reason, from childhood he had a delight in dwelling on dark
things, and entertaining odd fancies.  He might have had a monomania on
the subject of his departed idol; but on every other point his wits were
as sound as mine.

'I shall not know that till it comes,' he said; 'I'm only half conscious
of it now.'

'You have no feeling of illness, have you?' I asked.

'No, Nelly, I have not,' he answered.

'Then you are not afraid of death?' I pursued.

'Afraid?  No!' he replied.  'I have neither a fear, nor a presentiment,
nor a hope of death.  Why should I?  With my hard constitution and
temperate mode of living, and unperilous occupations, I ought to, and
probably _shall_, remain above ground till there is scarcely a black hair
on my head.  And yet I cannot continue in this condition!  I have to
remind myself to breathe--almost to remind my heart to beat!  And it is
like bending back a stiff spring: it is by compulsion that I do the
slightest act not prompted by one thought; and by compulsion that I
notice anything alive or dead, which is not associated with one universal
idea.  I have a single wish, and my whole being and faculties are
yearning to attain it.  They have yearned towards it so long, and so
unwaveringly, that I'm convinced it will be reached--and soon--because it
has devoured my existence: I am swallowed up in the anticipation of its
fulfilment.  My confessions have not relieved me; but they may account
for some otherwise unaccountable phases of humour which I show.  O God!
It is a long fight; I wish it were over!'

He began to pace the room, muttering terrible things to himself, till I
was inclined to believe, as he said Joseph did, that conscience had
turned his heart to an earthly hell.  I wondered greatly how it would
end.  Though he seldom before had revealed this state of mind, even by
looks, it was his habitual mood, I had no doubt: he asserted it himself;
but not a soul, from his general bearing, would have conjectured the
fact.  You did not when you saw him, Mr. Lockwood: and at the period of
which I speak, he was just the same as then; only fonder of continued
solitude, and perhaps still more laconic in company.




CHAPTER XXXIV


For some days after that evening Mr. Heathcliff shunned meeting us at
meals; yet he would not consent formally to exclude Hareton and Cathy.  He
had an aversion to yielding so completely to his feelings, choosing
rather to absent himself; and eating once in twenty-four hours seemed
sufficient sustenance for him.

One night, after the family were in bed, I heard him go downstairs, and
out at the front door.  I did not hear him re-enter, and in the morning I
found he was still away.  We were in April then: the weather was sweet
and warm, the grass as green as showers and sun could make it, and the
two dwarf apple-trees near the southern wall in full bloom.  After
breakfast, Catherine insisted on my bringing a chair and sitting with my
work under the fir-trees at the end of the house; and she beguiled
Hareton, who had perfectly recovered from his accident, to dig and
arrange her little garden, which was shifted to that corner by the
influence of Joseph's complaints.  I was comfortably revelling in the
spring fragrance around, and the beautiful soft blue overhead, when my
young lady, who had run down near the gate to procure some primrose roots
for a border, returned only half laden, and informed us that Mr.
Heathcliff was coming in.  'And he spoke to me,' she added, with a
perplexed countenance.

'What did he say?' asked Hareton.

'He told me to begone as fast as I could,' she answered.  'But he looked
so different from his usual look that I stopped a moment to stare at
him.'

'How?' he inquired.

'Why, almost bright and cheerful.  No, _almost_ nothing--_very much_
excited, and wild, and glad!' she replied.

'Night-walking amuses him, then,' I remarked, affecting a careless
manner: in reality as surprised as she was, and anxious to ascertain the
truth of her statement; for to see the master looking glad would not be
an every-day spectacle.  I framed an excuse to go in.  Heathcliff stood
at the open door; he was pale, and he trembled: yet, certainly, he had a
strange joyful glitter in his eyes, that altered the aspect of his whole
face.

'Will you have some breakfast?' I said.  'You must be hungry, rambling
about all night!'  I wanted to discover where he had been, but I did not
like to ask directly.

'No, I'm not hungry,' he answered, averting his head, and speaking rather
contemptuously, as if he guessed I was trying to divine the occasion of
his good humour.

I felt perplexed: I didn't know whether it were not a proper opportunity
to offer a bit of admonition.

'I don't think it right to wander out of doors,' I observed, 'instead of
being in bed: it is not wise, at any rate this moist season.  I daresay
you'll catch a bad cold or a fever: you have something the matter with
you now!'

'Nothing but what I can bear,' he replied; 'and with the greatest
pleasure, provided you'll leave me alone: get in, and don't annoy me.'

I obeyed: and, in passing, I noticed he breathed as fast as a cat.

'Yes!' I reflected to myself, 'we shall have a fit of illness.  I cannot
conceive what he has been doing.'

That noon he sat down to dinner with us, and received a heaped-up plate
from my hands, as if he intended to make amends for previous fasting.

'I've neither cold nor fever, Nelly,' he remarked, in allusion to my
morning's speech; 'and I'm ready to do justice to the food you give me.'

He took his knife and fork, and was going to commence eating, when the
inclination appeared to become suddenly extinct.  He laid them on the
table, looked eagerly towards the window, then rose and went out.  We saw
him walking to and fro in the garden while we concluded our meal, and
Earnshaw said he'd go and ask why he would not dine: he thought we had
grieved him some way.

'Well, is he coming?' cried Catherine, when her cousin returned.

'Nay,' he answered; 'but he's not angry: he seemed rarely pleased indeed;
only I made him impatient by speaking to him twice; and then he bid me be
off to you: he wondered how I could want the company of anybody else.'

I set his plate to keep warm on the fender; and after an hour or two he
re-entered, when the room was clear, in no degree calmer: the same
unnatural--it was unnatural--appearance of joy under his black brows; the
same bloodless hue, and his teeth visible, now and then, in a kind of
smile; his frame shivering, not as one shivers with chill or weakness,
but as a tight-stretched cord vibrates--a strong thrilling, rather than
trembling.

I will ask what is the matter, I thought; or who should?  And I
exclaimed--'Have you heard any good news, Mr. Heathcliff?  You look
uncommonly animated.'

'Where should good news come from to me?' he said.  'I'm animated with
hunger; and, seemingly, I must not eat.'

'Your dinner is here,' I returned; 'why won't you get it?'

'I don't want it now,' he muttered, hastily: 'I'll wait till supper.  And,
Nelly, once for all, let me beg you to warn Hareton and the other away
from me.  I wish to be troubled by nobody: I wish to have this place to
myself.'

'Is there some new reason for this banishment?' I inquired.  'Tell me why
you are so queer, Mr. Heathcliff?  Where were you last night?  I'm not
putting the question through idle curiosity, but--'

'You are putting the question through very idle curiosity,' he
interrupted, with a laugh.  'Yet I'll answer it.  Last night I was on the
threshold of hell.  To-day, I am within sight of my heaven.  I have my
eyes on it: hardly three feet to sever me!  And now you'd better go!
You'll neither see nor hear anything to frighten you, if you refrain from
prying.'

Having swept the hearth and wiped the table, I departed; more perplexed
than ever.

He did not quit the house again that afternoon, and no one intruded on
his solitude; till, at eight o'clock, I deemed it proper, though
unsummoned, to carry a candle and his supper to him.  He was leaning
against the ledge of an open lattice, but not looking out: his face was
turned to the interior gloom.  The fire had smouldered to ashes; the room
was filled with the damp, mild air of the cloudy evening; and so still,
that not only the murmur of the beck down Gimmerton was distinguishable,
but its ripples and its gurgling over the pebbles, or through the large
stones which it could not cover.  I uttered an ejaculation of discontent
at seeing the dismal grate, and commenced shutting the casements, one
after another, till I came to his.

'Must I close this?' I asked, in order to rouse him; for he would not
stir.

The light flashed on his features as I spoke.  Oh, Mr. Lockwood, I cannot
express what a terrible start I got by the momentary view!  Those deep
black eyes!  That smile, and ghastly paleness!  It appeared to me, not
Mr. Heathcliff, but a goblin; and, in my terror, I let the candle bend
towards the wall, and it left me in darkness.

'Yes, close it,' he replied, in his familiar voice.  'There, that is pure
awkwardness!  Why did you hold the candle horizontally?  Be quick, and
bring another.'

I hurried out in a foolish state of dread, and said to Joseph--'The
master wishes you to take him a light and rekindle the fire.'  For I
dared not go in myself again just then.

Joseph rattled some fire into the shovel, and went: but he brought it
back immediately, with the supper-tray in his other hand, explaining that
Mr. Heathcliff was going to bed, and he wanted nothing to eat till
morning.  We heard him mount the stairs directly; he did not proceed to
his ordinary chamber, but turned into that with the panelled bed: its
window, as I mentioned before, is wide enough for anybody to get through;
and it struck me that he plotted another midnight excursion, of which he
had rather we had no suspicion.

'Is he a ghoul or a vampire?' I mused.  I had read of such hideous
incarnate demons.  And then I set myself to reflect how I had tended him
in infancy, and watched him grow to youth, and followed him almost
through his whole course; and what absurd nonsense it was to yield to
that sense of horror.  'But where did he come from, the little dark
thing, harboured by a good man to his bane?' muttered Superstition, as I
dozed into unconsciousness.  And I began, half dreaming, to weary myself
with imagining some fit parentage for him; and, repeating my waking
meditations, I tracked his existence over again, with grim variations; at
last, picturing his death and funeral: of which, all I can remember is,
being exceedingly vexed at having the task of dictating an inscription
for his monument, and consulting the sexton about it; and, as he had no
surname, and we could not tell his age, we were obliged to content
ourselves with the single word, 'Heathcliff.'  That came true: we were.
If you enter the kirkyard, you'll read, on his headstone, only that, and
the date of his death.

Dawn restored me to common sense.  I rose, and went into the garden, as
soon as I could see, to ascertain if there were any footmarks under his
window.  There were none.  'He has stayed at home,' I thought, 'and he'll
be all right to-day.'  I prepared breakfast for the household, as was my
usual custom, but told Hareton and Catherine to get theirs ere the master
came down, for he lay late.  They preferred taking it out of doors, under
the trees, and I set a little table to accommodate them.

On my re-entrance, I found Mr. Heathcliff below.  He and Joseph were
conversing about some farming business; he gave clear, minute directions
concerning the matter discussed, but he spoke rapidly, and turned his
head continually aside, and had the same excited expression, even more
exaggerated.  When Joseph quitted the room he took his seat in the place
he generally chose, and I put a basin of coffee before him.  He drew it
nearer, and then rested his arms on the table, and looked at the opposite
wall, as I supposed, surveying one particular portion, up and down, with
glittering, restless eyes, and with such eager interest that he stopped
breathing during half a minute together.

'Come now,' I exclaimed, pushing some bread against his hand, 'eat and
drink that, while it is hot: it has been waiting near an hour.'

He didn't notice me, and yet he smiled.  I'd rather have seen him gnash
his teeth than smile so.

'Mr. Heathcliff! master!' I cried, 'don't, for God's sake, stare as if
you saw an unearthly vision.'

'Don't, for God's sake, shout so loud,' he replied.  'Turn round, and
tell me, are we by ourselves?'

'Of course,' was my answer; 'of course we are.'

Still, I involuntarily obeyed him, as if I was not quite sure.  With a
sweep of his hand he cleared a vacant space in front among the breakfast
things, and leant forward to gaze more at his ease.

Now, I perceived he was not looking at the wall; for when I regarded him
alone, it seemed exactly that he gazed at something within two yards'
distance.  And whatever it was, it communicated, apparently, both
pleasure and pain in exquisite extremes: at least the anguished, yet
raptured, expression of his countenance suggested that idea.  The fancied
object was not fixed, either: his eyes pursued it with unwearied
diligence, and, even in speaking to me, were never weaned away.  I vainly
reminded him of his protracted abstinence from food: if he stirred to
touch anything in compliance with my entreaties, if he stretched his hand
out to get a piece of bread, his fingers clenched before they reached it,
and remained on the table, forgetful of their aim.

I sat, a model of patience, trying to attract his absorbed attention from
its engrossing speculation; till he grew irritable, and got up, asking
why I would not allow him to have his own time in taking his meals? and
saying that on the next occasion I needn't wait: I might set the things
down and go.  Having uttered these words he left the house, slowly
sauntered down the garden path, and disappeared through the gate.

The hours crept anxiously by: another evening came.  I did not retire to
rest till late, and when I did, I could not sleep.  He returned after
midnight, and, instead of going to bed, shut himself into the room
beneath.  I listened, and tossed about, and, finally, dressed and
descended.  It was too irksome to lie there, harassing my brain with a
hundred idle misgivings.

I distinguished Mr. Heathcliff's step, restlessly measuring the floor,
and he frequently broke the silence by a deep inspiration, resembling a
groan.  He muttered detached words also; the only one I could catch was
the name of Catherine, coupled with some wild term of endearment or
suffering; and spoken as one would speak to a person present; low and
earnest, and wrung from the depth of his soul.  I had not courage to walk
straight into the apartment; but I desired to divert him from his
reverie, and therefore fell foul of the kitchen fire, stirred it, and
began to scrape the cinders.  It drew him forth sooner than I expected.
He opened the door immediately, and said--'Nelly, come here--is it
morning?  Come in with your light.'

'It is striking four,' I answered.  'You want a candle to take up-stairs:
you might have lit one at this fire.'

'No, I don't wish to go up-stairs,' he said.  'Come in, and kindle _me_ a
fire, and do anything there is to do about the room.'

'I must blow the coals red first, before I can carry any,' I replied,
getting a chair and the bellows.

He roamed to and fro, meantime, in a state approaching distraction; his
heavy sighs succeeding each other so thick as to leave no space for
common breathing between.

'When day breaks I'll send for Green,' he said; 'I wish to make some
legal inquiries of him while I can bestow a thought on those matters, and
while I can act calmly.  I have not written my will yet; and how to leave
my property I cannot determine.  I wish I could annihilate it from the
face of the earth.'

'I would not talk so, Mr. Heathcliff,' I interposed. 'Let your will be a
while: you'll be spared to repent of your many injustices yet! I never
expected that your nerves would be disordered: they are, at present,
marvellously so, however; and almost entirely through your own fault.
The way you've passed these three last days might knock up a Titan. Do
take some food, and some repose. You need only look at yourself in a
glass to see how you require both. Your cheeks are hollow, and your eyes
blood-shot, like a person starving with hunger and going blind with loss
of sleep.'

'It is not my fault that I cannot eat or rest,' he replied.  'I assure
you it is through no settled designs.  I'll do both, as soon as I
possibly can.  But you might as well bid a man struggling in the water
rest within arms' length of the shore!  I must reach it first, and then
I'll rest.  Well, never mind Mr. Green: as to repenting of my injustices,
I've done no injustice, and I repent of nothing.  I'm too happy; and yet
I'm not happy enough.  My soul's bliss kills my body, but does not
satisfy itself.'

'Happy, master?' I cried.  'Strange happiness!  If you would hear me
without being angry, I might offer some advice that would make you
happier.'

'What is that?' he asked.  'Give it.'

'You are aware, Mr. Heathcliff,' I said, 'that from the time you were
thirteen years old you have lived a selfish, unchristian life; and
probably hardly had a Bible in your hands during all that period.  You
must have forgotten the contents of the book, and you may not have space
to search it now.  Could it be hurtful to send for some one--some
minister of any denomination, it does not matter which--to explain it,
and show you how very far you have erred from its precepts; and how unfit
you will be for its heaven, unless a change takes place before you die?'

'I'm rather obliged than angry, Nelly,' he said, 'for you remind me of
the manner in which I desire to be buried.  It is to be carried to the
churchyard in the evening.  You and Hareton may, if you please, accompany
me: and mind, particularly, to notice that the sexton obeys my directions
concerning the two coffins!  No minister need come; nor need anything be
said over me.--I tell you I have nearly attained _my_ heaven; and that of
others is altogether unvalued and uncoveted by me.'

'And supposing you persevered in your obstinate fast, and died by that
means, and they refused to bury you in the precincts of the kirk?' I
said, shocked at his godless indifference.  'How would you like it?'

'They won't do that,' he replied: 'if they did, you must have me removed
secretly; and if you neglect it you shall prove, practically, that the
dead are not annihilated!'

As soon as he heard the other members of the family stirring he retired
to his den, and I breathed freer.  But in the afternoon, while Joseph and
Hareton were at their work, he came into the kitchen again, and, with a
wild look, bid me come and sit in the house: he wanted somebody with him.
I declined; telling him plainly that his strange talk and manner
frightened me, and I had neither the nerve nor the will to be his
companion alone.

'I believe you think me a fiend,' he said, with his dismal laugh:
'something too horrible to live under a decent roof.'  Then turning to
Catherine, who was there, and who drew behind me at his approach, he
added, half sneeringly,--'Will _you_ come, chuck?  I'll not hurt you.  No!
to you I've made myself worse than the devil.  Well, there is _one_ who
won't shrink from my company!  By God! she's relentless.  Oh, damn it!
It's unutterably too much for flesh and blood to bear--even mine.'

He solicited the society of no one more.  At dusk he went into his
chamber.  Through the whole night, and far into the morning, we heard him
groaning and murmuring to himself.  Hareton was anxious to enter; but I
bid him fetch Mr. Kenneth, and he should go in and see him.  When he
came, and I requested admittance and tried to open the door, I found it
locked; and Heathcliff bid us be damned.  He was better, and would be
left alone; so the doctor went away.

The following evening was very wet: indeed, it poured down till day-dawn;
and, as I took my morning walk round the house, I observed the master's
window swinging open, and the rain driving straight in.  He cannot be in
bed, I thought: those showers would drench him through.  He must either
be up or out.  But I'll make no more ado, I'll go boldly and look.'

Having succeeded in obtaining entrance with another key, I ran to unclose
the panels, for the chamber was vacant; quickly pushing them aside, I
peeped in.  Mr. Heathcliff was there--laid on his back.  His eyes met
mine so keen and fierce, I started; and then he seemed to smile.  I could
not think him dead: but his face and throat were washed with rain; the
bed-clothes dripped, and he was perfectly still.  The lattice, flapping
to and fro, had grazed one hand that rested on the sill; no blood
trickled from the broken skin, and when I put my fingers to it, I could
doubt no more: he was dead and stark!

I hasped the window; I combed his black long hair from his forehead; I
tried to close his eyes: to extinguish, if possible, that frightful,
life-like gaze of exultation before any one else beheld it. They would
not shut: they seemed to sneer at my attempts; and his parted lips and
sharp white teeth sneered too! Taken with another fit of cowardice, I
cried out for Joseph. Joseph shuffled up and made a noise, but
resolutely refused to meddle with him.

'Th' divil's harried off his soul,' he cried, 'and he may hev' his
carcass into t' bargin, for aught I care!  Ech! what a wicked 'un he
looks, girning at death!' and the old sinner grinned in mockery.  I
thought he intended to cut a caper round the bed; but suddenly composing
himself, he fell on his knees, and raised his hands, and returned thanks
that the lawful master and the ancient stock were restored to their
rights.

I felt stunned by the awful event; and my memory unavoidably recurred to
former times with a sort of oppressive sadness.  But poor Hareton, the
most wronged, was the only one who really suffered much.  He sat by the
corpse all night, weeping in bitter earnest.  He pressed its hand, and
kissed the sarcastic, savage face that every one else shrank from
contemplating; and bemoaned him with that strong grief which springs
naturally from a generous heart, though it be tough as tempered steel.

Mr. Kenneth was perplexed to pronounce of what disorder the master died.
I concealed the fact of his having swallowed nothing for four days,
fearing it might lead to trouble, and then, I am persuaded, he did not
abstain on purpose: it was the consequence of his strange illness, not
the cause.

We buried him, to the scandal of the whole neighbourhood, as he wished.
Earnshaw and I, the sexton, and six men to carry the coffin, comprehended
the whole attendance.  The six men departed when they had let it down
into the grave: we stayed to see it covered.  Hareton, with a streaming
face, dug green sods, and laid them over the brown mould himself: at
present it is as smooth and verdant as its companion mounds--and I hope
its tenant sleeps as soundly.  But the country folks, if you ask them,
would swear on the Bible that he _walks_: there are those who speak to
having met him near the church, and on the moor, and even within this
house.  Idle tales, you'll say, and so say I.  Yet that old man by the
kitchen fire affirms he has seen two on 'em looking out of his chamber
window on every rainy night since his death:--and an odd thing happened
to me about a month ago.  I was going to the Grange one evening--a dark
evening, threatening thunder--and, just at the turn of the Heights, I
encountered a little boy with a sheep and two lambs before him; he was
crying terribly; and I supposed the lambs were skittish, and would not be
guided.

'What is the matter, my little man?' I asked.

'There's Heathcliff and a woman yonder, under t' nab,' he blubbered, 'un'
I darnut pass 'em.'

I saw nothing; but neither the sheep nor he would go on so I bid him take
the road lower down.  He probably raised the phantoms from thinking, as
he traversed the moors alone, on the nonsense he had heard his parents
and companions repeat.  Yet, still, I don't like being out in the dark
now; and I don't like being left by myself in this grim house: I cannot
help it; I shall be glad when they leave it, and shift to the Grange.

'They are going to the Grange, then?' I said.

'Yes,' answered Mrs. Dean, 'as soon as they are married, and that will be
on New Year's Day.'

'And who will live here then?'

'Why, Joseph will take care of the house, and, perhaps, a lad to keep him
company.  They will live in the kitchen, and the rest will be shut up.'

'For the use of such ghosts as choose to inhabit it?' I observed.

'No, Mr. Lockwood,' said Nelly, shaking her head.  'I believe the dead
are at peace: but it is not right to speak of them with levity.'

At that moment the garden gate swung to; the ramblers were returning.

'_They_ are afraid of nothing,' I grumbled, watching their approach
through the window.  'Together, they would brave Satan and all his
legions.'

As they stepped on to the door-stones, and halted to take a last look at
the moon--or, more correctly, at each other by her light--I felt
irresistibly impelled to escape them again; and, pressing a remembrance
into the hand of Mrs. Dean, and disregarding her expostulations at my
rudeness, I vanished through the kitchen as they opened the house-door;
and so should have confirmed Joseph in his opinion of his
fellow-servant's gay indiscretions, had he not fortunately recognised me
for a respectable character by the sweet ring of a sovereign at his feet.

My walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of the kirk.
When beneath its walls, I perceived decay had made progress, even in
seven months: many a window showed black gaps deprived of glass; and
slates jutted off here and there, beyond the right line of the roof, to
be gradually worked off in coming autumn storms.

I sought, and soon discovered, the three headstones on the slope next the
moor: the middle one grey, and half buried in the heath; Edgar Linton's
only harmonized by the turf and moss creeping up its foot; Heathcliff's
still bare.

I lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths
fluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind
breathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever imagine
unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.
Sister Carrie

Chapter I
THE MAGNET ATTRACTING: A WIFE AMID FORCES

When Caroline Meeber boarded the afternoon train for Chicago, her total
outfit consisted of a small trunk, a cheap imitation alligator-skin
satchel, a small lunch in a paper box, and a yellow leather snap purse,
containing her ticket, a scrap of paper with her sister's address in
Van Buren Street, and four dollar in money. It was in August, 1889. She
was eighteen years or age, bright, timid, and full of the illusions of
ignorance and youth. Whatever touch of regret at parting characterized
her given up. A gush of tears at her mother's farewell kiss, mill where
her father worked by the day, a pathetic sigh as the familiar green
environs of the village passed in  review and the threads which bound
her so lightly to  girlhood and home were irretrievably broken.

To be sure there was always the next station, where one might descend
and return. There was the great city, bound more closely by these very
trains which came up daily. Columbia City was not so very far away,
even once she was in Chicago. What pray, is a few hours a few hundred
miles? She looked at the little slip bearing her sister's address and
wondered. She gazed at the green landscape, now passing in swift review
until her swifter thoughts replaced its impression with vague
conjectures of what Chicago might be.

When a girls leaves her home at eighteen, she does one of two things.
Either she falls into saving hands and becomes better, or she rapidly
assumes the cosmopolitan  standard of virtue and becomes worse. Of an
intermediate  balance, under the circumstances, there is no
possibility. The city has its cunning wiles, no less than the
infinitely smaller and more human tempter. There are large forces which
allure with all the soul fullness of expression possible in the most
cultured human. The gleam of a thousand lights is often as effective as
the persuasive light in a wooing and fascinating eye. Half the undoing
of the unsophisticated and natural mind is accomplished by forces
wholly superhuman. A blare of to the astonished scenes in equivocal
terms. Without a counselor at hand to whisper cautious interpretation
what falsehoods may not these things breathe into the unguarded ear!
Unrecognized for what they are, their  beauty, like music, too often
relaxes, then wakens, then perverts the simpler human perceptions.

Caroline, or Sister Carrie, as she had been half affectionately termed
by the family, was possessed of a mind rudimentary in its power of
observation and analysis. Self-interest with her was high, but not
strong. It was nevertheless, her guiding characteristic. Warm with the
fancies of youth, pretty with the insipid prettiness of the formative
period, possessed of a figure promising eventual shapeliness and an eye
alight with certain native intelligence she was a fair example of the
middle American class two generations removed from the emigrant. Books
were beyond her interest knowledge a sealed book. In the intuitive
graces she was still crude. She could scarcely toss her head
gracefully. Her hands were almost ineffectual. The feet, though small
were set flatly.  And yet she was interested in her charms, quick to
understand the keener pleasures of life, ambitious to gain in material
things. A half-equipped little knight she was, venturing to reconnoiter
the mysterious city and dreaming wild dreams of some vague, far-off
supremacy, which should make it prey and subject the proper penitent,
groveling at a women's slipper.

"That," said a voice in her ear," is one of the prettiest little
resorts in Wisconsin."

"Is it?" she answered nervously. The train was just pulling out of
Waukesha. For some time she had been conscious of a man behind. She
felt him observing her mass of hair. He had been fidgeting, and with
natural intuition she felt a certain interest growing in that quarter.
Her maidenly reserve, and a certain sense of what  was conventional
under the circumstances, called her to forestall and deny this
familiarity, but  the daring and magnetism of the individual, born of
past experience and triumphs, prevailed.  She answered.  	He leaned
forward to put his elbows upon the back of her seat and proceeded to
make himself volubly agreeable.

"Yes, that is a great resort for Chicago people. The hotels are swell.
You are not familiar with this part of the country, are you?"

"Oh, yes I am," answered Carrie. "That is, I live at Columbia City. I
have never been through here, though."

" And so this is your first visit to Chicago," he observed. All the
time she was conscious of certain features out of the side of her eye.
Flush, colorful cheeks, a light moustache, a gray fedora hat. She now
turned and looked upon him in full, the instincts of self-protection
and coquetry mingling confusedly in her brain.

" I didn't say that" she said

"Oh," he answered, in a very pleasing way and with and with an assumed
air of mistake, " I though you did."

Here was a type of the traveling canvasser for a manufacturing house a
class which at  that time was first being dubbed by the slang of the
day "drummers." He came within the meaning of a still newer term, which
had sprung into general use among Americans in 1880, and which
concisely expressed the though of one whose dress or manners are
calculated to elicit the admiration of susceptible young women a
"masher." His suit was of a striped and crossed pattern of brown wool,
new at that time, but since become familiar as a business suit. The low
crotch of the vest revealed a stiff bosom of white and pink stripes.
From his coat sleeves protruded a pair of linen cuffs of the same
pattern, fastened with large, gold plate buttons, set with the common
yellow agates known as "cat's-eyes." His finger bore several rings one,
the ever-ending heavy seal and from his vest dangled a neat gold watch
chain, from which was suspended the secret insignia of the Order of
Elks. The whole suit was rather tight-fitting, and was finished off
with heavy-soled tan shoes, highly polished, and the gray fedora hat.
He was, for the order of intellect represented, attractive, and
whatever he had to recommend him, you may be sure was not lost upon
Carrie, in this, her first glance.

 Lest this order of individual should permanently pass, let me put down
some of the most striking characteristics of his most successful manner
and method. Good clothes, of course, were the first essential, the
things without which he was nothing. A strong physical nature, actuated
by a keen desire for the feminine, was the next. A mind free of any
consideration of the problems or forces of the world and actuated not
by greed, but an insatiable love of variable pleasure. His method was
always simple. Its principal element was daring backed, of course, by
an intense desire and admiration for the sex. Let him meet with a young
women once and he would approach her with an air of kindly familiarity,
not unmixed with pleading, which would result in most cases in a
tolerant acceptance. If she showed any tendency to coquetry he would be
apt to straighten her tie, or if she "took up" with him at all, to call
her by her first name. If he visited a department  store it was to
lounge familiarly over the counter and ask some leading questions. In
more exclusive circles, on the train or in waiting stations, he went
slower. If some seemingly vulnerable object appeared he was all
attention to pass the compliments of the day to lead the way to the
parlor car, carrying her grip, or, failing that, to take a seat next
her with the hope of being able to court her to her destination.
Pillows, books, a footstool, the shade lowered;  all these figured in
the things which he could do. If, when she reached her destination he
did  not alight and attend her baggage for her, it was because, in his
own estimation, he had signally failed.

A women should some day write the complete philosophy of clothes. No
matter how young, it is one of the things she wholly comprehends. There
is an indescribably faint line in the matter of man's apparel, which
somehow divides for her those who are worth glancing at and those who
are not. Once an individual has passed this faint line on the way
downward he will get no glance from her. There is another line at which
the dress of a man will cause her to study her own. This line the
individual at her elbow now marked for Carrie. She became conscious of
an inequality. Her own plain blue dress, with its black cotton tape
trimmings, now seemed to her shabby. She felt the worn state of her
shoes.

"Let's see," he went on, "I know quite a number of people in your town.
Morgenroth the clothier and Gibson the dry goods man."

"Oh, do you?" she interrupted; aroused by memories of longings their
show windows had cost her.

At last he had a clew to her interest, and followed it deftly. In a few
minutes he had come about into her seat. He talked of sales of
clothing, his travels, Chicago, and the amusements of that city.

"If you are going there, you will enjoy it immensely. Have you
relatives?"

"I am going to visit my sister," she explained.

"You want to see Lincoln Park," he said, "and Michigan Boulevard. They
are putting up  great buildings there. It's a second New York great. So
much to see theatres, crowds, fine houses oh, you'll like that."

There was a little ache in her fancy of all he described. Her
insignificance in the presence of so much magnificence faintly affected
her. She realized that hers was not to be a round of pleasure, and yet
there was something promising in all the material prospect he set
forth. There was something satisfactory in the attention of this
individual with his good clothes. She could not help smiling as he told
her of some popular actress of whom she reminded him. She was silly and
yet attention of this sort had its weight.

"You will be in Chicago some little time, won't you?" he observed at
one turn of the now easy conversation. "I don't know," said Carrie
vaguely a flesh vision of the possibility of her not securing
employment rising in her mind.

"Several weeks, anyhow," he said, looking steadily into her eyes.

There was much more passing now than the mere words indicated. He
recognized the indescribable thing that made up for fascination and
beauty in her. She realized that she was of interest to him from the
one standpoint, which a women both delights in and fears. Her manner
was simple, though for the very reason that she had not yet learned the
many little affectations with which women conceal their true feelings.
Some things she did appeared bold. A clever companion had she ever had
one would have warned her never to look a man in the eyes so steadily.

"Why do you ask?" she said.

"Well, I'm going to be there several weeks. I'm going to study stock at
our place and get new samples. I might show you around."

" I don't know whether you can or not. I mean I don't know whether I
can. I shall be living with my sister, and

"Well, if she minds, we'll fix that." He took out his pencil and a
little pocket notebook as if it were all settled.

"What is your address there?" She fumbled her purse which contained the
address slip.

He reached down in his hip pocket and took out a fat purse. It was
filled with slip of paper, some mileage books, a roll of greenbacks. It
impressed her deeply. Such a purse had never been carried by any one
attentive to her. Indeed, and experienced traveler, a brisk man of the
world, had never come within such close range before. The purse, the
shiny tan shoes, the smart new suit, and the air with which he did
things, built up for her a dim world of fortune, of  which he was the
center. It disposed her pleasantly toward all he might do.

He took out a neat business card, on which was engraved Bartlett,
Caryoe & Company, and down in the left-hand corner, Chas. H. Druer.

"That's me," he said, putting the card in her hand and touching his
name. "It's  pronounced Drew-eh. Our family was French, on my father's
side."

She looked at it while he put up his purse. Then he got out a letter
from a bunch in his coat pocket. "This is the house I travel for," he
went on, pointing to a picture on it, "corner  of State and Lake."
There was pride in his voice. He felt that it was something to be
connected with such a place, and he made her feel that way.

"What is your address?" he began again, fixing his pencil to write.

She looked at his hand.

"Carrie Meeber," she said slowly. "Three hundred and fifty-four West
Van Street, care S.C Hanson."

He wrote it carefully down and got out the purse again. "You'll be at
home if I come around Monday night?" he said.

"I think so" she answered.

How true it is that words are but the vague shadows of the volumes we
mean. Little audible links, they are, chaining together great inaudible
feelings and purposes. Here were these two, bandying little phrases,
drawing purses, looking at cards, and both unconscious of how
inarticulate all their real feelings were. Neither was wise enough to
be sure of the working of  the mind of the other. He could not tell how
his luring succeeded. She could not realize that she was drifting,
until he secured her address. Now she felt that she had yielded
something he, that he had gained a victory. Already they felt that they
were somehow associated. Already he took control on directing the
conversation. His words were easy. Her manner was relaxed.

They were nearing Chicago. Signs were everywhere numerous. Trains
flashed by them. Across wide stretches of flat, open prairie they could
see lines of telegraph poles stalking across the fields toward the
great city. Far away were indications of suburban towns, some big
smoke-stacks towering high in the air.

Frequently there were two-story frame houses standing out in the open
fields, without fences or trees, lone outposts of the approaching army
of homes.

To the child, the genius with imagination, of the wholly untraveled,
the approach to a  great city for the first time is a wondering thing.
Particularly if it be evening that mystic period between the glare and
gloom of the world when life is changing from one sphere or condition
to another. Ah, the promise of the night. What does it not hold for the
weary! What old illusion of hope is not here forever repeated! Says the
soul of the toiler to itself, "I shall soon be free. I shall be in the
ways and the hosts of the merry. The streets, the lamps, the lighted
chamber set for dining, are for me. The theatre, the halls, the
parties, the ways of rest and the paths of song these are mine in the
night." Though all humanity be still enclosed in the shops,  the thrill
runs abroad. It is in the air. The dullest feel something which they
may not always express or describe. It is the lifting of the burden of
toil.

Sister Carrie gazed out of the window. Her companion, affected by her
wonder, so contagious are all things, felt a new some interest in the
city and pointed out its marvels.

"This is Northwest Chicago," said Drouet. "This is the Chicago River,"
and he pointed to a little muddy creek, crowded with the huge masted
wanderers from far off waters nosing the black posted banks. With a
puff, a clang, and a clatter of rails it was gone. "Chicago is getting
to be a great town," he went on. "It's a wonder. You'll find lots to
see here."

She did not hear this very well. Her heart was troubled by a kind of
terror. The fact that she was alone, away from home, rushing into a
great sea of life and endeavor began to tell.  She could not help but
feel a little choked for breath a little sick as her heart beat so
fast.   She half closed her eyes and tried to think it was nothing,
that Columbia City was only a little way off.

"Chicago! Chicago!" called the brakeman, shamming open the door. They
were rushing into a more crowded yard, alive with the clatter and clang
of life. She began to gather up her poor little grip and closed her
hand firmly upon her purse. Drouet arose, kicked his legs to straighten
his trousers, and seized his clean yellow grip. "I suppose your people
will be here to meet you?" he said. "Let me carry your grip."

"Oh, no," she said. "I'd rather you wouldn't. I'd rather you wouldn't
be with me when I meet my sister." "All right," he said n all kindness.
"I'll be near though, in case she isn't here, and take you out there
safely."

You're so kind," said Carrie, feeling the goodness of such attention in
her strange situation.

"Chicago!" called the brakeman, drawing the word out long. They were
under a great shadowy train shed where the lamps were already beginning
to shine out, with passenger cars all about and train moving at s
snail's pace. The people in the car were all up and crowding about the
door.

" Well, here we are," said Drouet, leading the way to the door. "Good-
bye, till I see you  Monday."

"Good-bye," she answered, taking his proffered hand. Remember, I'll be
looking till you  find your sister smiled into his eyes.

They filed out, and he affected to take no notice of her. A lean-faced,
rather commonplace woman recognized Carrie on the platform and hurried
forward.

"Why, Sister Carrie!" she began, and there was a perfunctory embrace of
welcome.

Carrie realized the change of affect ional atmosphere at once. Amid all
the maze, uproar,  and novelty she felt cold reality taking her by the
hand. No world of light and merriment. No round of amusement. Her
sister carried with her most of the grimness of shift and toil.

"Why, how are all the folks at home?" she began; "how is father, and
mother?"

Carrie answered, but was looking away. Down the aisle, toward the gate
leading into the  waiting-room and the street, stood Drouet. He was
looking back. When he saw that she saw him and was safe with her sister
he turned to go, sending back the shadow of a smile. Only Carrie saw
it.  She felt something lost to her when he moved away. When he
disappeared she felt his absence thoroughly. With her sister she was
much alone, a lone figure in a tossing, thoughtless sea.


Chapter II
WHAT POVERTY THREATENED: OF GRANITE AND BRASS

 Minnie's flat, as the one-floor resident apartment were then being
called, was in a part of West Van Buren Street inhabited by families of
labourers and clerks, men who had come, and were still coming, with the
rush of population pouring in at the rate of 50,000 a year. It was on
the third floor, the front windows looking down into the street, where,
at night the lights of grocery stores were shinning and children were
playing. To Carrie, the sound of the little bells upon the horses-cars,
as it was novel.

She gazed into the lighted street when Minnie brought her into the
front room, and wondered at the sounds, the movement, the murmur of the
vast city which stretched for miles and miles in every direction.

Mrs. Hanson, after the first greetings were over, gave  Carrie the baby
and proceed to get supper. Her husband asked a few questions and sat
down to read the evening paper. He was  silent man, American born, of a
Swede father, and now employed as a cleaner of refrigerator cars at the
stock-yards. To him the presence or absence of his wife's sister was a
matter of indifference. Her personal appearance did not affect him one
way or the other. His one observation to the point was concerning the
chances of work in Chicago.

"It's a big place" he said. "You can get in some where in a  few days.
Everybody does"
It had been tacitly understood beforehand that she was to get work and
pay her board. He was of a clean, saying disposition, and had already
paid a number of monthly installments on two lots far out the West
Side. His  ambition was some day to build a house on them.

 In the interval which marked the preparation of the meal Carrie found
time to study the flat. She had some slight gift of observation and
that sense, so rich in every women intuition.

She felt the drag of a lean and narrow life. The walls of the rooms
were discordantly papered. The floors were covered with matting and the
hall laid with a thin rag carpet. One could see that the furniture was
of that poor, hurriedly patched together quality sold by the
installment houses.

 She sat with Minnie, in the kitchen, holding the baby until it began
to cry. Then she walked and sang to it, until Hanson, disturbed in his
reading, came and took it A pleasant side to his nature came out here.
He was patient. One could see that he was very much wrapped up in his
offspring.

"Now, now," he said, walking. "There, there," and there was a certain
Swedish accent noticeable in his voice

"You'll want to see the city first, won't you?" said Minnie, when they
were eating. "Well, we'll go out Sunday and see Lincoln Park."

 Carrie noticed that Hanson had said nothing to this He seemed to be
thinking of something else.

"Well," she said, " I think I'll look around to-morrow I've got Friday
and Saturday, and it won't be any trouble Which way is the business
part?"

Minnie began to explain, but her husband took this part of the
conversation to himself.

"It's that way," he said, pointing east. "That's east Then he went off
into the longest speech he had yet indulged  in, concerning the lay of
Chicago. You'd better look in those  big manufacturing houses along
Franklin Street and just the  other side of the river," he concluded.
"Lots of girls work there. You could get home easy, too. It isn't very
far."

Carrie nodded and asked her sister about the neighborhood. The latter
talked in a subdued tone, telling the little she knew about it, while
Hanson concerned himself with the baby. Finally he jumped up and handed
the child to his wife.

"I've got to get up early in the morning, so I'll go to bed," and off
he went, disappearing into the dark little bedroom off the hall, for
the night.

"He works way down at the stock-yards," explained Minnie, "so he's got
to get up at half-past five."

"What time do you get up to get breakfast?" asked Carrie.

"At about twenty minutes of five." Together they finished the labor of
the day, Carrie  washing the dishes while Minnie undressed the baby and
put it to bed. Minnie's manner was one of trained industry, and Carrie
could see that it was a steady round of toil with her.

She began to see that her relations with Drouet would have to be
abandoned. He could not come here. She read from the manner of Hanson,
in the subdued air of Minnie, and, indeed, the whole atmosphere of the
flat, a settled opposition to anything save a conservative round of
toil. If Hanson sat every evening in the front room and read his paper,
if he went to bed at nine, and Minnie a little later, what would they
except of her? She saw that she would first need to get work and
establish herself company of any sort. Her little flirtation with
Drouet seemed now an extraordinary thing.

No," she said to herself, "he can't come here." She asked Minnie for
ink and paper, which were upon the mantel in the dining-room, and when
the latter had gone to bed at ten, got out Drouet's card and wrote him.

" I cannot have you call on me here. You will have to wait until you
hear from me again. My sister's place is so small."

She troubled herself over what else to put in the letter She wanted to
make some reference to their relations upon the train, but was too
timid. She concluded by thanking him for his kindness in a cruded way,
then puzzled over the formality of signing her name, and finally
decided upon the severe, winding up with a "Very truly," which she
subsequently changed to "Sincerely." She  sealed and addressed the
letter, and going in the front room, the alcove of which contained her
bed, drew the one small rocking-chair up to the open window, and sat
looking out upon the night and streets in silent wonder. Finally,
wearied by her own reflections, she began to  grow dull in her chair,
and feeling the need of sleep, arranged  her clothing for the night and
went to bed.

When she awoke at eight the next morning, Hanson had gone. Her sister
was busy in the dining-room, which was also the sitting-room, sewing.
She worked, after  dressing, to arrange a little breakfast for herself,
and then  advised with Minnie as to which way to look. The latter had
changed considerably since Carrie had seen her. She  was now a thin,
though rugged, women of twenty-seven, with ideas of life colored by her
husband's and fast hardening into narrower conceptions of pleasure and
duty than  had ever been hers in a thoroughly circumscribed youth. `She
had invited Carrie, not because she longed for her presence, but
because the latter was dissatisfied at home, and could probably get
work and pay her board here. She was plead to see her in a way but
reflected her husband's point of view in the matter of work. Anything
was good enough so long as it paid say, five dollars a week to begin
with. A shop girl was the destiny prefigured for the newcomer. She
would get in one of the great shops and do well enough until  something
happened. Neither of them knew exactly what. They did not figure on
promotion. They did not exactly count on marriage. Things would go on,
though, in a  dim kind of way until the better thing would eventuate,
and Carrie would rewarded for coming and toiling in the city. It was
under such auspicious circumstances that she started out this morning
to look for work.

Before following her in her round of seeking, let us look at the sphere
in which her future was to lie. In 1889 Chicago had the peculiar
qualifications of growth which  of young girls plausible. Its many and
growing commercial  opportunities gave it widespread fame, which  made
of it a giant magnet, drawing to itself, from all quarters, the hopeful
and the hapless those who had their fortune yet to make and those
fortunes and affairs had reached a disastrous climax elsewhere. It was
a city  of over 500,000, with the ambition, the daring, the activity of
a metropolis of a million. Its streets and houses were miles. Its
population was not so much thriving upon pared prepared for the arrival
of others. The sound of the ham everywhere heard. Great industries were
moving in. The huge railroad corporations which had long before
recognized the prospects of the place had seized upon vast tracts of
land for transfer and shipping purposes. Street-car lines had been
extended far out into the open  country in anticipation of rapid
growth. The city had laid miles and miles of streets and sewers through
regions where, perhaps, one solitary house stood out alone a  pioneer
of the populous ways to be. There were regions open to the sweeping
winds and rain, which were yet  lighted throughout the night with long,
blinking lines of  gas-lamps, fluttering in the wind. Narrow board
walks  extended out, passing here a house, and there a store  at far
intervals, portion was the vast wholesales and shopping district, to
which the uninformed seeker for work usually drifted. It was a
characteristics of Chicago then and one not generally shared by other
cities, that individual firms of any pretension occupied individual
buildings.

The presence of ample ground made this possible. It gave an imposing
appearance to most of the wholesales plain view of the street. The
large plates of window glass now so common, were them rapidly coming
into use, and  gave to the ground floor offices a distinguished and
prosperous look. The casual wanderer could see as he passed a polished
array of office fixtures, much frosted glass clerks hard at work, and
genteel business men in "nobby" suits and clean linen lounging about or
sitting in groups. Polished brass or nickel signs at the square stone
entrances announced the firm and the nature of the business in rather
neat and reserved terms. The entire metropolitan center possessed a
high and mighty air calculated to  overawe and abash the common
applicant, and to make the gulf between poverty and success seem both
wide and deep.

 Into this important commercial region the timid Carrie went. She
walked east along Van Buren Street through  a region of lessening
importance, until it deteriorated into  a mass of shanties and coal-
yards, and finally verged upon  the river. She walked bravely forward,
led by an honest desire to find employment and delayed at every step by
the interest of the unfolding scene, and a sense of helplessness amid
so much evidence of power and force which  she did not understand.
These vast buildings, what were what purposes were they there? She
could have understood the meaning of a little stone-cutter's yard at
Columbia  city, carving little pieces of marble for individual use, but
when the yards of some huge stone corporation came into view, filled
with spur tracks and flat cars, transpierced by docks from the river
and traversed overhead by immense  trundling cranes of wood and steel,
it lost all significance in her little world.

It was so with the vast railroad yards, with the crowded array of
vessels she saw at the river, and the huge factories over the way,
lining the water's edge. Through the open  windows she could see the
figures of men and women in  working aprons, moving busily about. The
great streets were wall-lined mysterious to her; the vast offices,
strange  mazes which concerned far-off individuals of importance. She
could only think of people connected with them as  counting money,
dressing magnificently, and riding in  carriages. What they dealt in,
how they labored, to what end it all came, she had only the vaguest
conception.

It was all wonderful, all vast, all far removed, and she sank in spirit
inwardly and fluttered feebly at the  heart as she though of entering
any one of these mighty  concerns and asking for something to do
something  that she could do anything.


Chapter III
WE QUESTION OF FORTUNE: FOUR-FIFTY A WEEK

 Once across the river and into the wholesale district she glanced
about her for some likely door at which to apply. As she contemplated
the wide windows and imposing signs, she became conscious of being
gazed upon and understood for what she was a wage seeker. She had never
done this thing before, and lacked courage. To avoid a certain
indefinable shame she felt at being caught spying about for a position,
she quickened her steps and assumed an air of indifference supposedly
common to one upon an errand. In this way she passed many manufacturing
and wholesale houses without once glancing in. At last, after several
blocks of walking, she felt that this would not do, and began to look
about again  though without relaxing her pace. A little way on she saw
a great door which, for some reason, attracted her attention. It was
ornamented by a small brass sign, and seemed to be the entrance to a
vast hive of six or seven floors. " Perhaps," she though, "they may
went some  one," and crossed over to enter. When she came within  a
score of feet of the desired goal, she saw through the window a young
man in a gray checked suit. That he  had anything to do with the
concern, she could not tell but because he happened to be looking in
her direction her weakening heart misgave her and she hurried by, too
overcome with shame to enter. Over the way stood a  great six-story
structure, labeled Storm and King, which she viewed with rising hope.
It was a wholesale dry goods concern and employed women. She could see
them  moving about now and then upon the upper floors. This  place she
decided to enter, no matter what. She crossed over and walked directly
toward the entrance. As she did so, two men came out and paused in the
door. A telegraph messenger in blue dashed past her and up the few
steps that led to the entrance and disappeared. Several pedestrians out
of the hurrying throng which filled the sidewalks passed about her as
she paused, hesitating. She  looked helplessly around, and then, seeing
herself observed, retreated. It was too difficult a task. She could
not go past them.

So serve a defeat told upon her nerves. Her feet carried her
mechanically forward, every foot of her progress being a satisfactory
portion of a flight which she gladly made. Block after passed by. Upon
street-lamps at the various corners she read names such as Madison,
Monroe, La Salle, Clark, Dearborn, State, and still she went, her feet
beginning to tire upon the broad stone flagging. She was pleased in
part that the streets were  bright and clean. The morning sun, shining
down with steadily increasing warmth, made the shady side of the
streets pleasantly cool. She looked at the blue sky overhead with more
realization of its charm than had ever  come to her before.

Her cowardice began to trouble her in a way. She  turned back,
resolving to hunt up Storm and King and enter. On the way she
encountered a great wholesale shoe company, through the broad plate
windows of which she saw an enclosed executive department, hidden by
frosted glass. Without this enclosure, but just within  the street
entrance, sat a haired-haired gentleman at a small table, with a large
open ledger before him. She walked by this institution several times
hesitating, but finding  herself unobserved, faltered past the screen
door and stood humbly waiting.

"Well, young lady," observed the old gentleman, looking at her somewhat
kindly, "what is it you wish?"

"I am, that is, do you I mean, do you need any help?" she stammered.

"Not just at present," he answered smiling.  "Not just at present. Come
in some time next week. Occasionally we need some one."

She received the answer in silence and backed awkwardly out. The
pleasant nature of her reception rather astonished her. She had
expected that it would be more difficult, that something cold and harsh
would be said she knew not what. That she had not been put to shame and
made to feel her unfortunate position, seemed remarkable.

Somewhat encouraged, she ventured into another large structure. It was
a clothing company, and more people were in evidence well dressed men
of forty and more, surrounded by brass railings.

An office boy approached her.

"Who is it you wish to see?" he asked.

"I want to see the manager," she said.

He ran away and spoke to one of a group of three men who were
conferring together. One of these came towards her.

"Well?" he said coldly. The greeting drove all courage from her at
once.

"Do you need any help?" she stammered.

"No," he replied abruptly, and turned upon his heel.

She went foolishly out, the office boy deferentially swinging the door
for her, and gladly sank into the obscuring  crowd. It was a serve
setback to her recently pleased mental state.

Now she walked quite aimlessly for a time, turning here and there,
seeing one great company after another, but  finding no courage to
prosecute her single inquiry. High noon came, and with it hunger. She
haunted out unassuming restaurant and entered, but was disturbed to
find the prices were exorbitant for the size of her purse. A bowl of
soup was all that she could afford, and with this quickly eaten, she
went out again. It restored her strength somewhat and made her
moderately bold to pursue the search.

In walking a few blocks to fix upon some probable  place, she again
encountered the firm of Storm and King, and this time managed to get
in. Some gentlemen were conferring close at hand, but took no notice of
her. She was left standing, gazing nervously upon the floor. When  the
limit of her distress had been nearly reached, she was beckoned to by a
man at one of the many desks within the  near-by railing.

"Who is it you wish to see?" he inquired.

"Why, any one, if you please," she answered. " I am looking for
something to do."

"Oh, you want to see Mr. McManus," he returned. "Sit down," and he
pointed to a chair against the neighboring wall. He went on leisurely
writing, until after a  time a short, stout gentlemen came in from the
street.

"Mr. McManus," called the man at the desk, "this young women wants to
see you"

The short gentlemen turned about towards Carrie, and she rose and came
forward.

"What can I do for you, miss?" he inquired, surveying her curiously.

"I want to know if I can get a position," she inquired.

"As what?" he asked.

"Not as anything in particular," she faltered.

"Have you ever had any experience in the wholesale dry goods business?"
he questioned.

"No, sir," she replied.

"Are you a stenographer or typewriter?"

"No, sir."

"Well, we haven't anything here," he said. "We employ only experienced
help."

She began to step backward toward the door, when  something about her
plaintive face attracted him.

"Have you ever worked at anything before?" he inquired.

"No, sir," she said.

"Well, now, it's hardly possible that you would get anything to do in a
wholesale house of this kind. Have you tried the department stores?"

She acknowledged that she had not.

"Well, if I were you," he said, looking at her rather genially, "I
would try the department stores. They often  need young women as
clerks."

"Thank you," she said, her whole nature relieved by  this spark of
friendly interest.

"Thank you," she said, her whole nature relieved by this spark of
friendly interest.

"Yes," he said, as she moved toward the door, "you  try the department
stores," and off he went.

At the time the department store was in its earliest form of successful
operation, and there were not many  The first three in the United
States, established about  1884, were in Chicago. Carrie was familiar
with the  names of several through the advertisements in the  "Daily
News," and now proceeded to seek them. The  words of Mr. McManus had
somehow managed to restore  her courage, which had fallen low, and she
dared to hope that this new line would offer her something. Sometime
she spent in wandering up and down, thinking to encounter the buildings
by chance, so readily is the mind, bent upon prosecuting a hard but
needful errand, eased by that self-deception which the semblance of
search  without the reality gives. At last she inquired of a police
officer, and was directed to proceed "two blocks up," where she would
find "The Fair."

The nature of these vast retail combinations, should they ever
permanently disappear, will form an interesting  chapter in the
commercial history of our nation. Such  a flowering out of a modest
trade principle the world had never witnessed up to that time. They
were along the  line of the most effective retail organization, with
hundreds of stores coordinated into one and laid out upon  the most
imposing and economic basis. They were handsome, bustling, successful
affairs, with a host of clerks and a swarm of patrons. Carrie passed
along the busy  aisles, much affected by the remarkable displays of
trinkets, dress goods, stationery, and jewelry. Each separate counter
was a show place of dazzling interest and attraction.

She could not help feeling the chain of each trinket and valuable upon
her personally, and yet she did not  stop. There was nothing there
which she could not have  used-nothing which she did not long to own.
The dainty slippers and stockings, the delicately frilled skirts and
petticoats, the laces, ribbons, hair-combs, purses, all touched her
with individual desire, and she felt keenly the fact that not any of
these things were in the range of  her purchase. She was a work-seeker,
an outcast without  employment, one whom the average employee could
tell at a glance was poor and in need of a situation.

It must not be thought that any one could have mistaken her for a
nervous, sensitive, high-strung nature, east unduly upon a cold,
calculating, and un-poetic world. Such certainly she was not. But women
are peculiarly sensitive to their adornment.

Not only did Carrie feel the drag of desire for all which was new and
pleasing in apparel for women, but she noticed too, with a touch at the
heart, the fine ladies who elbowed and ignored her, brushing past in
utter disregard of her presence, themselves eagerly enlisted in the
materials which the store contained. Carrie was not familiar with the
appearance of her more fortunate sister of the  city. Neither had she
before known the nature and appearance of the shop girls with whom she
now compared poorly. They were pretty in the main, some even handsome,
with an air of independence and indifference which added, in the case
of the more favored, a certain piquancy. Their clothes were neat, in
many instances fine, and wherever she encountered the eye of one it was
her individual shortcomings of dress and that shadow of manner which
she though must hang about her and  lighted in her heart. She realized
in a dim way how meant for women, and she longed for dress and beauty
with a whole heart.

On the second floor were the managerial offices, to which, after some
inquiry, she was now directed. There she found other girls ahead of
her, applicants like herself. but with more of that self-satisfied and
independent air which experience of the city lends; girls who
scrutinized her in a painful manner. After a wait of perhaps three
quarters of an hour, she was called in turn.

"Now," said a sharp, quick-mannered Jew, who was sitting at a roll-top
desk near the windows, "have you even worked in any other store?"

"No, sir," said Carrie.

"Oh, you haven't," he said, eyeing her keenly.

"No, sir," she replied.

"Well, we prefer young women just now with some  experience. I guess we
can't use you."

Carrie stood waiting a moment, hardly certain whether the interview had
terminated.

"Don't wait!" he exclaimed. "Remember we are  very busy here."

Carrie began to move quickly to the door.

"Hold on," he said, calling her back. "Give me your name and address.
We want girls occasionally."

When she had gotten safely into the street, she could scarcely restrain
the tears. It was not so much the particular rebuff which she had just
experienced, but the whole  abashing trend of the day. She was tried
and nervous. She abandoned the though of appealing to the other
department stores and now wandered on, feeling a certain  safety and
relief in mingling with the crowd.

In her indifferent wandering she turned into Jackson Street, nor far
from the river, and was keeping her way  along the south side of that
imposing thoroughfare, when a piece of wrapping paper, written on with
marking ink and tacked up on the door, attracted her attention. It
read, "Girls wanted wrappers & stitchers. She hesitated a moment, then
entered.

The firm of Speigelheim & Co, makers of boys' caps, occupied one floor
of the building, fifty feet in width and some eighty feet in depth. It
was a place rather dingily lighted, the darkest portions having
incandescent lights, filled with machines and work benches. At the
latter labored quite a company of girls and some men. The  former were
drabby-looking creatures, stained in face with oil and dust, clad in
thin, shapeless, cotton dresses and shod with more or less worn shoes.
Many of them had  their sleeves rolled up, revealing bare arms, and in
some cases, owing to the heat, their dresses were open at the  neck.
They were a fair type of nearly the lowest order of shop-girls-
careless, slouchy, and more or less paid of from confinement. They were
not timid, however; were rich in curiosity, and strong in daring and
slang.

Carrie looked about her, very much disturbed and quite sure that she
did not want to work here. Aside from making her uncomfortable by
sidelong glances, no one  paid her the least attention. She waited
until the whole department was aware of her presence. Then some word
was sent around, and a foreman, in an apron and shirt sleeves, the
latter rolled up to his shoulders, approached.

"Do you want to see me?" he asked.

"Do you need any help?" said Carrie, already learning directness of
address.

"Do you know how to stitch caps?" he returned.

"No, sir," she replied.

"Have you ever had any experience at this kind of work?" he inquired.

She answered that she had not.

"Well," said the foreman, scratching his ear meditatively, "we do need
a stitcher. We like experienced help, though. We've hardly got time to
break people in." He  paused and looked away out of the window. "We
might,  though, put you at finishing," he concluded reflectively.

"How much do you pay a week?" ventured Carrie, emboldened by a certain
softness in the man's manner and his simplicity of address.

"Three and a half," he answered.

"Oh," she was about to exclaim, but checked herself and allowed her
thoughts to die without expression.

"We're not exactly in need of anybody," he went on  vaguely, looking
her over as one would a package. "You  can come on Monday morning,
though," he added, " and I'll put you to work."

"Thank you," said Carrie weakly.

"If you come, bring an apron," he added.

He walked away and left her standing by the elevator, never so much as
inquiring her name.

While the appearance of the shop and the announcement of the price paid
per week operated very much as a blow to  Carrie's fancy, the fact that
work of any kind was  offered after so rude a round of experience was
gratifying. She could not begin to believe that she would take the
place, modest as her aspirations were. She had been used to better than
that. Her mere experience and the free out-of-door life of the country
caused her nature to revolt at such confinement. Dirt had never been
her share. Her sister's flat was clean. This place was grimy and low,
the girls were careless and hardened. They must be bad-minded and
hearted, she imagined. Still, a place had been offered her. Surely
Chicago was not so bad if she  could find one place in one day. She
might find another and better later.

Her subsequent experiences were not of a reassuring nature, however.
From all the more pleasing or imposing  places she was turned away
abruptly with the most  chilling formality. In other where she applied
only the  experienced were required. She met with painful rebuffs, the
most trying of which had been in a manufacturing  cloak house, where
she had gone to the fourth floor to inquire.

"No, no," said foreman, a rough, heavily built individual, who looked
after a miserably lighted workshop,  "we don't want any one. Don't come
here."

With the wane of the afternoon went her hopes, her courage, and her
strength. She had been astonishingly persistent. So earnest an effort
was well deserving of a  better reward. On every hand, to her fatigued
senses, the great business portion grew larger, harder, more stolid in
its indifference. It seemed as if it was all closed to her, that the
struggle was too fierce for her to hope to  do anything at all. Men and
women hurried by in long, shifting lines. She felt the flow of the tide
of effort and interest felt her own helplessness without quite
realizing the wisp on the tide that she was. She cast about vainly for
some possible place to apply but found no door which she had the
courage to enter. It would be the same thing all over. The old
humiliation of her plea, rewarded by curt denial. Sick at heart and in
body, she turned to the west, the direction of Minie's flat, which she
had now fixed in mind, and begat that wearisome, baffled retreat makes.
In passing through Fifth Avenue, south towards Van Buren Street, where
she intended to take a car, she  passed the door of a large wholesale
shoe house, through the plate-grass window of which she could see a
middle aged gentleman sitting at a small desk. One of those  forlorn
impulses which often grow out of a fixed sense of defeat, the last
sprouting of a baffled and uprooted growth through the door and up to
the gentleman, who looked at  her weary face with partially awakened
interest.

"What is it?" he said.

"Can you give me something to do?" said Carrie.

"Now, I really don't know," he said kindly. "What kind of work is it
you want-you're not a typewriter, are you?"

"Oh, no," answered Carrie.

"Well, we only employ book-keepers and typewriters here. You might go
around to the side and inquire upstairs. They did want some help
upstairs a few days ago. Ask for Mr. Brown."

She hastened around to the side entrance and was taken up by the
elevator to the fourth floor.

"Call Mr. Brown, Willie," said the elevator man to a boy near by.

Willie went off and presently returned with the information that Mr.
Brown said she should sit down and that  he would be around in a little
while.

It was a portion of the stock room which gave no idea of the general
character of the place, and Carrie could form no opinion of the nature
of the work.

"So you want something to do," said Mr. Brown, after he inquired
concerning the nature of her errand. " Have you ever been employed in a
shoe factory before?"

"No, sir," said Carrie.

"What is your name?" he inquired, and being informed, "Well, I don't
know as I have anything for you. Would you work for four and a half a
week?"

Carrie was too worn by defeat not to feel that it was considerable. She
had not expected that he would offer her less than six. She acquiesced,
however, and he took her name and address.

"Well," he said, finally, "you report here at eight o'clock Monday
morning. I think I can find something for you to do."

He left her revived by the possibilities, sure that she had found
something at last. Instantly the blood crept  warmly over her body. Her
nervous tension relaxed. She walked out into the busy street and
discovered a new atmosphere. Behold, the throng was moving with a
lightsome step. She noticed that men and women were smiling. Scraps of
conversation and notes of laughter floated to her. The air was light.
People were already pouring out of the buildings, their labor ended for
the day. She noticed that they were pleased, and thoughts of her
sister's home and the meal that would be awaiting her quickened her
steps. She hurried on, tired perhaps, but no longer weary of foot. What
would not Minnie say! Ah, the long winter in Chicago-the lights, the
crowd, the amusement! This was a great, pleasing metropolis after all.
Her new firm was a goodly institution Its windows were of huge plate
glass. She could probably do well there. Thoughts of Drouet returned-of
the things he had told her. She now felt that life was better that it
was livelier, sprightlier. She boarded a car in the  best of spirits,
feeling her blood still flowering pleasantly. She would live in
Chicago, her mind kept saying to itself. She would have a better time
than she had ever had before she would be happy.


Chapter IV
THE SPENDINGS OF FANCY: FACTS ANSWER WITH SNEERS

For the next two days Carrie indulged in the most high flown
speculations.

Her fancy plunged recklessly into privileges and  amusements which
would have been much more becoming had she been cradled a child of
fortune. With ready will and quick mental selection she scattered her
meager four-fifty per week with a swift and graceful hand. Indeed, as
she sat in her rocking-chair these several evenings before going to bed
and looked out upon the pleasantly lighted street, this money cleared
for its prospective possessor the way to every joy and every bauble
which the  heart of woman may desire. " I will have a fine time," she
though.

Her sister Minnie knew nothing of these rather wild cerebrations,
though they exhausted the markets of delight. She was too busy
scrubbing the kitchen woodwork and calculating the purchasing power of
eighty cents for Sunday's dinner. When Carrie had returned home,
flushed with her first success and ready, for all her weariness, to
discuss the now interesting events which led up to her achievement, the
former had merely smiled approvingly and inquired whether she would
have to  spend any of it for car fare. This consideration had not
entered in before, and it did not now for long affect the  glow of
Carrie's enthusiasm. Disposed as she then was to calculate upon that
vague basis which allows the subtraction of one sum from another
without any perceptible diminution, she was happy.

When Hanson came home at seven o'clock, he was inclined to be a little
crusty-his usual demeanor before supper. This never showed so much in
anything he said as in a certain solemnity of countenance and the
silent manner in which he slopped about. He had a pair of yellow carpet
slippers which he enjoyed wearing, and these he would immediately
substitute for his soiled pair of shoes. This, and washing his face
with the aid of common washing soap until it glowed a shiny red,
constituted his only preparation for his evening meal. He would  then
get his evening paper and read in silence.

For a young man, this was rather a morbid turn of character, and so
affected Carrie. Indeed, it affected the entire atmosphere of the flat,
as such things are inclined to do, and gave to his wife's mind its
subdued and tactful turn, anxious to avoid taciturn replies. Under the
influence of Carrie's announcement he brightened up some what.

" You didn't lose any time, did you?" he remarked, smiling a little.

"No," returned Carrie with a touch of pride.

He asked her one or two more questions and then turned to play with the
baby, leaving the subject until it was brought up again by Minnie at
the table.

Carrie, however, was not to be reduced to the common level of
observation which prevailed in the flat.

" It seems to be such a large company," she said, at one place. " Great
big plate-glass windows and lots of clerks. The man I saw said they
hired ever so many people."

"It's not very hard to get work now," put in Hanson, "if you look
right."

Minnie under the warning influence of Carrie's good spirits and her
husband's somewhat conversational mood, began to tell Carrie of some of
the well-known things to  see-things the enjoyment of which cost
nothing.

" You'd like to see Michigan Avenue. There are such fine houses. It is
such a fine street."

" Where is ' H.R. Jacob's'?" interrupted Carrie, mentioning one of the
theatres devoted to melodrama which went by that name at the time.

"Oh, it's not very far from here," answered Minnie. " It's in Halstead
Street, right up here."

" How I'd like to go there. I crossed Halstead Street to-day, didn't
I?"

At this there was a slight halt in the natural reply. Thoughts are a
strangely permeating factor. At her suggestion of going to the theatre,
the unspoken shade of disapproval to the doing of those things which
involved the expenditure of money-shades of feeling which arose in the
mind of Hanson and then on Minnie-slightly affected the atmosphere of
the table. Minnie answered "yes," but Carrie could feel that going to
the theatre was poorly advocated here. The subject was put off for a
little while  until Hanson, through with his meal, took his paper and
went into the front room.

When they were alone, the two sisters began a somewhat freer
conversation, Carrie interrupting it to hum a little, as they worked at
the dishes.

" I should  like to walk up and see Halstead Street, if it isn't too
far," said Carrie, after a time. " Why don't we go to the theatre to-
night?"

" Oh, I don't think Sven would want to go to-night," returned Minnie. "
He has to get up so early."

" He wouldn't mind-he'd enjoy it," said Carrie.

" No, he doesn't go very often," returned Minnie.

" Well, I'd like to go," rejoined Carrie. " Let's you and me go."

Minnie pondered a while, not upon whether she could or would go for
that point was already negatively settled with her-but upon some means
of diverting the  thoughts of her sister to some other topic.

" We'll go some other time," she said at last, finding no ready means
of escape.

Carrie sensed the root of the opposition at once.

" I have some money," she said. " You go with me.'

Minnie shook her head.

" He could go along," said Carrie.

" No, returned Minnie softly, and rattling the dishes to drown the
conversation. " He wouldn't."

It had been several years since Minnie had seen Carrie, and in that
time the latter's character had developed a few shades. Naturally timid
in all things that related to her own advancement, and especially so
when without power or resource, her craving for pleasure was so strong
that it  was the one stay of her nature. She would speak for that when
silent on all else.

" Ask him," she pleaded softly.

Minnie was thinking of the resource which Carrie's board would add. It
would pay the rent and would make  the subject of expenditure a little
less difficult to talk about with her husband. But if Carrie was going
to think of running around in the beginning there would be a  hitch
somewhere. Unless Carrie submitted to a solemn round of industry and
saw the need of hard work without longing for play, how was her coming
to the city to profit them? These thoughts were not those of a cold,
hard nature at all. They were the serious reflections of a mind which
invariably adjusted itself, without much complaining, to such
surroundings as its industry could make for it.

At last she yield enough to ask Hanson. It was a half-hearted procedure
without a shade of desire on her part.

" Carrie wants us to go to the theatre," she said, looking in upon her
husband. Hanson looked up from his paper, and they exchanged a mild
look, which said as plainly as  anything: " This isn't what we
expected."

" I don't care to go," he returned. " What does she want to see?"

" H.R Jacob's," said Minnie.

He looked down at his paper and shook his head negatively.

When Carrie saw how they looked upon her proposition, she gained a
still clearer feeling of their way of life. It weighted on her, but
took no definite form of opposition.

" I think I'll go down and stand at the foot of the stairs," she said,
after a time.

Minnie made no objection to this, and Carrie put on her hat and went
below.

" Where has Carrie gone?" asked Hanson, coming  back into the dinning-
room when he heard the door close.

" She said she was going down to the foot of the stairs," answered
Minnie. " I guess she just wants to look out  a while."

" She oughtn't to be thinking about spending her money on theatres
already, do you think?" he said.

" She just feels a little curious, I guess," ventured Minnie. "
Everything is so new."

" I don't know," said Hanson, and went over to the  baby, his forehead
slightly wrinkled.

He was thinking of a full career of vanity and wastefulness which a
young girl might indulge in, and wondering how Carrie could contemplate
such a course when she  had so little, as yet, with which to do.

On Saturday Carrie went out by herself-first toward the river, which
interested her, and then back along Jackson Street, which was then
lined by the pretty houses and fine lawns which subsequently caused it
to be made into a boulevard. She was struck with the evidences of
wealth, although there was, perhaps, not a person on the street worth
more than a hundred thousand dollars. She was glad to be out of the
flat, because already she felt that it was a narrow, humdrum place, and
that interest and joy lay elsewhere. Her thoughts now were of a more
liberal character, and she punctuated them with speculations as to the
whereabouts of Drouet. She was not sure but that  he might call anyhow
Monday night, and, while she felt a little disturbed at the
possibility, there was, nevertheless, just the shade of a wish that he
would.

On Monday she arose early and prepared to go to work.      She dressed
herself in a worn shirt-waist of dotted blue percale, a skirt of light-
brown serge rather faded, and a  small straw hat which she had worn all
summer at Columbia City. Her shoes were old, and her necktie was in
that crumpled, flattened state which time and much wearing impart. She
made a very average looking shop-girl with the exception of her
features. These were slightly more even than common, and gave her a
sweet, reserved, and pleasing appearance.

It is no easy thing to get up early in the morning when one is used to
sleeping until seven and eight, as Carrie had been at home. She gained
some inkling of the character of Hanson's life when, half asleep, she
looked out into  the dinning-room at six o'clock and saw him silently
finishing his breakfast. By the time she was dressed he was gone, and
she, Minnie, and the baby ate together, the latter being just old
enough sit in a high chair and disturb the dishes with a spoon. Her
spirits were greatly subdued now when the fact of entering upon strange
and untried duties confronted her. Only the ashes of all her fine
fancies were remaining-ashes still concealing, never the less, a few
red embers of hope. So subdued was she  by her weakening nervous, that
she ate quite in silence. going over imaginary conceptions of the
character of the shoe company, the nature of the work, her employer's
attitude. She was vaguely feeling that she would come in contract with
the great owners, that her work come in contract with the great owners,
that her work would be where grave, stylishly dressed men occasionally
look on.

" Well, good luck," said Minnie, when she was ready to go. They had
agreed it was best to walk, that morning at least, to see if she could
do it every day-sixty cents a week for car fare being quite an item
under the circumstances.

" I'll tell you how it goes to-night," said Carrie.

Once in the sunlit street, with labourers tramping by in either
direction, the horse-cars passing crowded to the  rails with the small
clerks and floor help in the great  wholesales houses, and men and
women generally coming  out of doors and passing about the
neighourhood, Carrie  felt slightly reassured. In the sunshine of the
morning, beneath the wide, blue heavens, with a fresh wind astir, what
fears, except the most desperate, can find a harbourage? In the night,
or the gloomy chambers of the day, fears and misgivings wax strong, but
out in the sunlight there is, for a time, cessation even of the terror
of death.

Carrie went straight forward until she crossed the river, and then
turned into Fifth Avenue. The thoroughfare, in this part, was like a
walled canon of brown stone and clean. Trucks were rumbling in
increasing numbers; men and  woman, girls and boys were moving onward
in all directions. She met girls of her own age, who looked at her as
if with contempt for her diffidence. She wondered at the magnitude of
this life and at the importance of knowing much in order to do anything
in it at all. Dread at her own inefficiency crept upon her. She would
not  know how, she would not be quick enough. Had not all  the other
places refused her because she did not know something or other? She
would be scolded, abused, ignominiously discharged.

It was with weak knees and a slight catch in her breathing that she
came up to the great shoe company at Adams and Fifth Avenue and entered
the elevator. When she  steeped out on the fourth floor there was no
one at hand, only great aisles of boxes piled to the ceiling. She
stood, very much frightened, awaiting some one.

Presently Mr. Brown came up. He did not seem to recognise her.

" What is it you want?" he inquired.

Carrie's heart sank.

" You said I should come this morning to see about work-"

" Carrie Meeber."

" Yes," said he. " You come with me."

He led the way through dark, box-lined aisles which had the smell of
new shoes, until they came to an iron door which opened into the
factory proper. There was a  large, low-ceiled room, with clacking,
rattling machines at which men in white shirt sleeves and blue gingham
aprons were working. She followed him diffidently through the
clattering automatons, keeping her eyes straight before her, and
flushing slightly. They crossed to a far corner and took an elevator to
the sixth floor. Out of the array of machines and benches, Mr. Brown
signaled a foreman.

" This is the girls," he said, and turning to Carrie, " You  go with
him." He then returned, and Carrie followed her new superior to a
little desk in a corner, which he used as a kind of official center.

" You've  never worked at anything like this before, have you?" he
questioned, rather sternly.

" No, sir," she answered.

He seemed rather annoyed at having to bother with such help, but put
down her name and then led her across to where a line of girls occupied
stools in front of clacking machines. On the shoulder of one of the
girls who was  punching eye-holes in one piece of the upper, by the aid
of the machine, he put his hand.

" You," he said, " show this girl how to do what you're doing. When you
get through, come to me."

The girl so addressed rose promptly and gave Carrie her place.

" It isn't hard  to do," she said, bending over. " You just take this
so, fasten it with this clamp, and start the  machine."

She suited action to work, fastened the piece of leather, which was
eventually to form the right half of the upper of a man's shoe, by
little adjustable clamps, and pushed a small steel rod at the side of
the machine. The latter jumped to the task of punching, with sharp,
snapping clicks, cutting circular bits of leather out of the side of
the  upper, leaving the holes which were to hold the laces. After
observing a few times, the girl let her work at it alone. Seeing that
it was fairly well done, she went away.

The pieces of leather came from the girl at the machine to her right,
and were passed on to the girl at her left. Carrie saw at once that an
average speed was necessary or the work would pile up on her and all
those below would be delayed. She had no time to look about, and bent
anxiously to her task. The girls at her left and right realized her
predicament and feelings, and, in a way, tried to aid her, as much as
they dared, by working slower.

At this task she labored incessantly for some time, finding relief from
her own nervous fears and imaginings in the humdrum, mechanical
movement of the machine. She felt, as the minutes passed, that the room
was not very light. It had a thick odor of fresh leather, but that did
not worry her. She felt the eyes of the other help upon her, and
troubled lest she was not working fast enough.

Once, when she was fumbling at the little clamp, having made a slight
error in setting in the leather, a great hand appeared before her eyes
and fastened the clamp for her. It was the foreman. Her heart thumped
so that she could  scarcely see to go on.

" Start your machine," he said, " start your machine.       Don't keep
the line waiting."

This recovered her sufficiently and she went excitedly on, hardly
breathing until the shadow moved away from behind her. Then she heaved
a great breath.

As the morning wore on the room became hotter. She felt the need of a
breath of fresh air and a drink of water but did not venture to stir.
The stool she sat on was without a back or foot-rest, and she began to
feel uncomfortable. She found, after a time, that her back was
beginning to ache. She twisted and turned from one position to another
slightly different, but it did not ease her for long. She was beginning
to weary.

" Stand up, why don't you?" said the girl at her right without any form
of introduction. " They won't care."

Carrie looked at her gratefully. " I guess I will," she said.

She stood up from her stool and worked that way for a while, but it was
a more difficult position. Her neck and  shoulder ached in bending
over.

The spirit of the place impressed itself on her in a rough way. She did
not venture to look around, but above the clack of the machine she
could hear an occasional remark. She could also note a thing or two out
of the side of her eye.

" Did you see Harry last night?" said the girl at her left, addressing
her neighbor

" No."

" You ought to have seen the tie he had on. Gee, but he was a mark."

" S-s-t," said the other girl, bending over her work.

The first, silenced, instantly assumed a solemn face. The foreman
passed slowly along, eyeing each worker distinctly. The moment he was
gone, the conversation was  resumed again.

" Say," began the girl at her left, " what do you think he said?"

" I don't know."

" He said he saw us with Eddie Harris at Martin's last night."

" No!" They both giggled.

A youth with tan-colored hair, that needed clipping very badly, came
shuffling along between the machines, bearing a basket of leather
findings under his left arm, and pressed against his stomach. When near
Carrie, he stretched out his right hand and gripped one girl under the
arm.

" Aw, let me go," she exclaimed angrily. " Duffer."

He only grinned broadly in return.

" Rubber!" he called back as she looked after him.

There was nothing of the gallant in him.

Carrie at last could scarcely sit still. Her legs began to tire and she
wanted to get up and stretch. Would noon never come? It seemed as if
she had worked an entire day. She was not hungry at all, but weak, and
her eyes were tired, straining at the one point where the eye-punch
came down. The girl at the right noticed her squirmings and felt sorry
for her. She was concentrating herself too thoroughly-what she did
really required less mental and physical strain. There was nothing to
be done, however. The halves of the uppers came piling steadily down.
Her hands began to ache at the wrists and then in the fingers and
towards the last she seemed one mass of dull, complaining muscles,
fixed in an eternal position and performing a single mechanical
movement which become more and more distasteful, until at last it was
absolutely nauseating. When she was wondering whether the strain would
ever cease, a dull-sounding bell clanged somewhere down an elevator
shaft, and the end came. In a instant there was a buzz of action and
conversation. All the girls instantly left their stools and hurried
away in an adjoining room, men passed through, coming from some
department which opened on the right. The whirling wheels  began to
sing in a steadily modifying key, until at last they died away in a low
buzz. There was an audible stillness, in which the common voice sounded
strange.

Carrie got up and sought her lunch box. She was stiff, a little dizzy,
and very thirsty. On the way to the small space portioned off by wood,
where all the wraps and  lunches were kept, she encountered the
foreman, who  started at her hard.

" Well," he said, " did you get along all right?"

" I think so," she replied, very respectfully.

" Um," he replied, for want of something better, and walked on.

Under better material conditions, this kind of work would not have been
so bad, but the new socialism which involves pleasant working
conditions for employees had not then taken hold upon manufacturing
companies.

The place smelled of the of the oil of the machines and the new
leather-a combination which, added to the stale odors of the building,
was not pleasant even on cold weather. The floor, though regularly
swept every evening, presented a littered surface. Not the slightest
provision had been made for the comfort of the employees, the idea
being that something was gained by giving them as little and making the
work as hard and unremunerative as possible. What we know of foot-
rests, swivel-back chairs, dinning-rooms for the girls, clean aprons
and curling irons supplied free, and decent cloak room, were unthought
of. The washrooms were disagreeable, crude, if not foul places, and the
whole atmosphere was sordid.

Carrie looked about her, after she had drunk a tinful of water from a
bucket in one corner, for a place to sit and eat. The other girls had
ranged themselves about the  windows or the work-benches of those of
the men who had gone out. She saw no place which did not hold a couple
or a group of girls, and being too timid to think of intruding herself,
she sought out her machine and, seated upon her stool, opened her lunch
on her lap. There she sat listening to the chatter and comment about
her. It was for the most part, silly and graced by the current slang,
Several of the men in the room exchanged compliments with the girls at
long range.

" Say, Kitty," called to a girl who was doing a waltz step in a few
feet of space near one of the windows, " are you going to the ball with
me?"

" Look out, Kitty," called another, " you'll jar your back hair."

" Go on, Rubber," was her only comment.

As Carrie listened to this and much more of similar familiar badinage
among the men and girls, she instinctively withdrew into herself. She
was not used to this type, and felt that there was something hard and
low about it all. She feared that the young boys about would address
such remarks to her-boys who, beside Drouet, seemed uncouth and
ridiculous. She made the average  feminine distinction between clothes,
putting worth, goodness, and distinction in a dress suit, and leaving
all the unlovely qualities and those beneath notice in overalls and
jumper.

She was glad when the short half hour was over and the wheels began to
whirr again. Though wearied, she would be inconspicuous. This illusion
ended when another young man passed along the aisle and poked her
indifferently in the ribs with his thumb. She turned  about,
indignation leaping to her eyes, but he had gone on and only once
turned to grin. She found it difficult to conquer an inclination to
cry.

The girl next her noticed her state of mind. " Don't  you mind," she
said. " He's too fresh."

Carrie said nothing, but bent over her work. She felt as though she
could hardly endure such a life. Her idea of work had been so entirely
different. All during the long afternoon she thought of the city
outside and its imposing show, crowds, and fine buildings. Columbia
City and the better side of her home life came back. By three o'clock
she was sure it must be six, and by four it seemed as if they had
forgotten to note the hour and were letting all work overtime. The
foreman became a true ogre, prowling constantly about, keeping her tied
down to her miserable task. What she heard of the conversation about
her only made her feel sure that she did not want to make friends with
any of these. When six o'clock  came she hurried eagerly away, her arms
aching and her limbs stiff from sitting in one position.

As she passed put along the hall after getting her hat, a young machine
hand, attracted by her looks, made bold to jest with her.

" Say, Maggie," he called, " if you wait, I'll walk with you."

It was thrown so straight in her direction that she knew who was meant,
but never turned took.

In the crowded elevator, another dusty, toil-stained  youth tried to
make an impression on her by leering in her face.

One young man, waiting on the walk outside for the  appearance of
another, grinned at her as she passed.

" Ain't going my way, are you?" he called jocosely.

Carrie turned her face to the west with a subdued heart.

As she turned the corner, she saw through the great shiny window the
small desk at which she had applied. There were the crowds, hurrying
with the same buzz and energy yielding enthusiasm. She felt a slight
relief, but it was only at her escape. She felt ashamed in the face of
better dressed girls who went by. She felt as though she should be
better served, and her heart revolted.


Chapter V
A GLITTERING NIGHT FLOWER: THE USE OF A NAME

 Drouet did not call that evening. After receiving the  letter, he had
laid aside all thought of Carrie for the time being and was floating
around having what he considered a gay time. On this particular evening
he dined at " Rector's," a restaurant of some local fame, which
occupied a basement at Clark and Monroe Streets. Thereafter he visited
the resort of Fitzgerald and Moy's in Adams Street, opposite the
imposing Federal Building. There he leaned over the splendid bar and
swallowed a glass of plain whiskey and purchased a couple of cigars,
one of which he lighted. This to him represented in part high life-a
fair sample of what the whole must be.

Drouet was not a drinker in excess. He was not a  moneyed man. He only
craved the best, as his mind conceived it, and such doings seemed to
him a part of the best. Rector's, with its polished marble walls and
floor, its profusion of lights, its show of china and silverware, and,
above all, its reputation as a resort for actors and professional men,
seemed to him the proper place for a successful man to go. He loved
fine clothes, good eating, and particularly the company and
acquaintanceship of successful men. When dining, it was source of keen
satisfaction to him to know that Joseph Jefferson was wont to come to
this same place, r that Henry E. Dixie, a well known performer of the
day, was then only a few tables off. At Rector's he could always obtain
this satisfaction for there one could encounter politicians, brokers,
actors, some rich young "rounders" of the town, all eating and drinking
amid a buzz of popular commonplace conversation.

" That's So-and so over there," was a common remark of these gentlemen
among themselves, particularly among those who had not yet reached, but
hoped to do so, the  dazzling height which money to dine here lavishly
represented.

" You don't say so," would be the reply.

" Why, yes, didn't you know that? Why, he's manager

of the Grand Opera House."

When these things would fall upon Drouet's ears, he would straighten
himself a little more stiffly and eat with solid comfort. If he had any
vanity, this augmented it, and if he had any ambition, this stirred it.
He would be able to flash a roll of greenbacks too some day. As it was,
he could eat where they did.

His preference for Fitzgerald and Moy's Adams Street place was another
yard off the same cloth. This was really a gorgeous saloon from a
Chicago standpoint. Like  Rector's, it was also ornamented with a blaze
of incandescent lights, held in handsome chandeliers. The floors were
of brightly colored tiles, the walls a composition of rich, dark,
polished wood, which gave the place a very sumptuous appearance. The
long bar was a blaze of lights, polished wood-work, colures and cut
glassware, and many fancy bottles. It was a truly swell saloon, with
rich screens, fancy wines, and a line of bar goods unsurpassed in the
country.

At Rector's Drouet had met Mr. G. W. Hurstwood, manager of Fitgerald
and Moy's. He had been  pointed out as a very successful and well-known
man about town. Hurstwood looked the part, for, besides being slightly
under forty, he had a good, stout constitution, an active manner, and
solid, substantial air, which was composed in part of his fine clothes,
his clean linen, his jewels, and, above all, his own sense of his
importance. Drouet immediately conceived a notion of him as being some
one worth knowing, and was glad not only to meet him, but to visit the
Adams Street bar thereafter whenever he wanted a drink or a cigar.

Hurstwood was an interesting character after his kind. He was shrewd
and clever in many little things, and capable of creating a good
impression. His managerial position was fairly important-a kind of
stewardship which was imposing, but lacks financial control. He had
risen by perseverance and industry, through long years of service, from
the position of barkeeper in a commonplace saloon to his present
altitude. He had a little office in the  place, set off in polished
cherry and grill-work, where he kept, in a roll-top desk, the rather
simple accounts of the  place-supplies ordered and needed. The chief
executive and financial functions devolved upon the owner Messrs.
Fitzgerald and Moy-and upon a cashier who looked after the money taken
in.

For the most part he lounged about, dressed in excellent tailored suits
of imported goods, a solitaire ring, a fine blue diamond in his tie, a
striking vest of some new pattern, and a watch-chain of solid gold,
which held a charm of rich design, and a watch of the latest make and
engraving. He knew by name, and could greet personally with a " Well,
old fellow," hundreds of actors, merchants, politicians, and the
general run of successful characters about town, and it was part of his
success to do so. He had a  finely graduated scale of informality and
friendship, which improved from the " How do you do?" addressed to the
fifteen-dollar-a-week clerks and office attaches, who, by long
frequenting of the place, became aware of his position, to the " Why
old man, how are you?" which he addressed to those noted or rich
individuals who knew him and were inclined to be friendly. There was a
class however, too rich, too famous, or too successful with whom he
could not attempt any familiarity of address, and with these he was
professionally tactful, assuming a grave and dignified attitude, paying
them the deference which would win their good feeling without in the
least compromising his own bearing and opinions. There were, in the
last place, a few good followers, neither rich nor poor, famous, nor
yet remarkably successful, with whom he was  friendly on the score of
good-fellowship. These were the  kind of men with whom he would
converse longest and most seriously. He loved to go out and have a good
time once in a while to go to the races, the theatres, the sporting
entertainments at some of the clubs. He kept a horse  and neat trap,
had his wife and two children, who were well established in neat house
on the North Side near Lincoln Park, and was altogether a very
acceptable individual of our great American upper class-the first grade
below the luxuriously rich.

Hurstwood liked Douet. The latter's genial nature and dressy appearance
pleased him. He knew that  Drouet was only a traveling salesman-and not
one of many years at that-but the firm of Barlett, Caryoe & Company was
large and prosperous house, and Drouet stood well. Hurstwood knew
Caryoe quite well, having drunk a glass now and then with him, in
company with several others, when tie conversation was general. Drouet
had what was a help in his business, a moderate sense of humor, and
could tell a good story when the occasion required. He could talk races
with Hurstwood, tell interesting incidents concerning himself and his
experiences with women, and report the state of trade in the  cities
which he visited, and so managed to make himself almost invariably
agreeable. To-night he was particularly so, since his report to the
company had been favorably commented upon, his new samples had been
satisfactorily selected, and his trip marked out for the next six
weeks.

" Why, hello, Charlie, old man," said Hurstwood, as Drouet came in that
evening about eight o'clock. " How  goes it?" The room was crowded.

Drouet shook hands, beaming good nature, and they strolled towards the
bar.

" Oh, all right."

" I haven't seen you in six weeks. When did you get in?"

" Friday," said Drouet. " Had a fine trip."

" Glad of it," said Hurstwood, his black eyes lit with a warmth which
half displaced the cold make-believe that  usually dwelt in them. "
What are you going to take?" he added, as the barkeeper, in snowy
jacket and tie, leaned toward them from behind the bar.

" Oh, all right."

" I haven't seen you in six weeks. When did you get in?"

" Friday," said Drouet. " Had a fine trip."

" Glad of it," said Hurstwood, his black eyes lit with a  warmth which
half displaced the cold make-believe that usually dwelt in them. "
Where are you going to take?" he added, as the barkeeper, in snowy
jacket and tie, leaned toward them from behind the bar.

" Old Pepper," said Drouet.

" A little of the same for me," put in Hurstwood.

" How long are you in town this time? inquired Hurstwood.

" Only until Wednesday. I'm going up to St. Paul."

" George Evans was in here Saturday and said he saw you in Milwaukee
last week."

" Yes, I saw George," returned Drouet. " Great old boy, isn't he? We
had quite a time there together."

The barkeeper was setting out the glasses and bottle  before them, and
they now poured out the drought as they talked, Drouet filling his to
within a third of full, as was considering proper, and Hurstwood taking
the barest suggestion of whiskey and modifying it with seltzer.

" What's become of Caryoe?" remarked Hurstwood " I haven't seen him
around here in two weeks."

" Laid up, they say," exclaimed Drouet. " Say, he's a gouty old boy!"

" Made a lot of money in his time, though, hasn't he?"

" Yes, and swift-pacer," laughed Drouet.

" I guess he can't hurt the business very much, though, with the other
members all there."

" No, he can't injure that any, I guess."

Hurstwood was standing, his coat open, his thumbs in his pockets, the
light on his jewels and rings relieving  them with agreeable
distinctness. He was the picture of fastidious comfort.

To one not inclined to drink, and gifted with a more serious turn of
mind, such a bubbling, chattering, glittering chamber must ever seem an
anomaly, a strange commentary on nature and life. Here come the moths,
in endless procession, to bask in the light of the flame. Such
conversation as one may hear would not warrant a commendation of the
scene upon intellectual grounds. It seems plain that schemers would
choose more sequestered quarters to arrange their plans, that
politicians would not gather here in company to discuss anything save
formalities, where the sharp-eared may hear, and it would scarcely be
justified on the score of thirst, for the majority of those who
frequent these more gorgeous places have no craving for liquor.
Nevertheless, the fact that here men gather, there chatter, here love
to pass and rub elbows, must be explained upon some grounds. It must be
that  a strange bundle of passions and vague desires give rise to such
a curious social institution or it would not be.

Drouet, for one, was lured as much by his longing for pleasure as by
his desire to shine among his betters. The many friends he met here
dropped in because they craved, without, perhaps, consciously analyzing
it, the company, the glow, the atmosphere which they found. One might
take it, after all, as an auger of the better social order, for the
things which they satisfied here, though sensory, were not evil. No
evil could come out of the contemplation of an expensively decorated
chamber. The worst effect of such a thing would be, perhaps, to stir up
in the material minded an ambition to arrange their lives upon a
similarly splendid basis. In the last analysis, that would scarcely be
called the fault of the decorations, but rather of the innate trend of
the mind. That such a scene might stir the less expensively dressed to
emulate the more expensively dress could scarcely be laid at the door
of anything save the false ambition of the minds of those so affected.
Remove the element so thoroughly and solely complained of-liquor-and
there would not be one to gainsay the qualities of beauty and
enthusiasm which would remain. The pleased eye with which our modern
restaurants of fashion are looked upon is proof of this assertion.

Yet, here is the fact of the lighted chamber, the dressy greedy
company, the small, self-interested palaver, the disorganized, aimless,
wandering mental action which it represents-the love of light and show
and finery which, to one outside, under the serene light of the eternal
stars, and sweeping night winds, what a lamp-flower it must  bloom; a
strange, glittering night-flower, yielding-yielding, insect-drawing,
insect-infested rose of pleasure.

" See that a fellow coming in there?" said Hurstwood, glancing at a
gentlemen just entering, arrayed in a high hat and Prince Albert coat,
his fat cheeks puffed and red as with good eating.

" No, where?" said Drouet.

" There," said Hurstwood, indicating the direction by a cast of his
eye, " the man with the silk hat."

" Oh, yes," said Drouet, now affecting not to see. " Who is he?"

" That's Jules Wallace, the spiritualist."

Drouet followed him with his eyes, much interested.

" Doesn't look much like a man who sees spirits, does he?" said Drouet.

" Oh, I don't know," returned Hurstwood. " He's got the money, all
right," and a little twinkle passed over his  eyes.

" I don't go much on those things, do you?" asked Drouet.

" Well, you never can tell," said Hurstwood. " There may be something
to it. I wouldn't bother about it myself, though. By the way," he
added, " are you going anywhere to-night?"

" The Hole in the Ground," said Drouet, mentioning the popular farce of
the time.

" Well, you'd better be going. It's half after eight already," and he
drew out his watch.

The crowd was already thinning out considerably, some bound for the
theatres, some to their clubs, and  some to that most fascinating of
all the pleasures for the type of man there represented, at least the
ladies.

" Yes, I will," said Drouet.

" Come around after the show. I have something I want to show you,"
said Hurstwood.

" Sure," said Drouet, elated.

" You haven't anything on hand for the night, have you?" added
Hurstwood.

" Not a thing."

" Well, come round, then."

" I struck a little peach coming in on the train Friday," remarked
Drouet, by way of parting. " By George, that's so, I must go and call
on her before I go away."

" Oh, never mind her" Hurstwood remarked.

" Say, she was a little dandy, I tell you," went on Drouet
confidentially, and trying to impress his friend.

" Twelve o'clock," said Hurstwood.

" That's right," said Drouet, going out.

Thus was Carrie's name bandied about in the most frivolous and gay of
places, and that also when the little toiler was bemoaning her narrow
lot, which was almost inseparable from the early stages of this, her
unfolding fate.


Chapter VI
THE MACHINE AND THE MAIDEN: A KNIGHT OF TO-DAY

 At the flat that evening Carrie felt a new phase of its atmosphere.
The fact that it was unchanged, while her feelings were different,
increased her knowledge of its character. Minnie, after the good
spirits Carrie manifested at first, expected a fair report. Hanson
supposed that Carrie would be satisfied.

" Well," he said, as he came in from the hall in his working clothes,
and looked at Carrie through the dining-room door, " how did you make
out?"

" Oh," said Carrie, " it's pretty hard. I don't like it."

There was an air about her which showed plainer than any words that she
was both weary and disappointed.

" What sort of work is it?" he asked, lingering a moment as he turned
upon his heel to go into the bathroom.

" Running a machine," answered Carrie.

It was very evident that it did not concern him much, save from the
side of the flat's success. He was irritated a shade because it could
not have come about in the throw of fortune for Carrie to be pleased.

Minnie worked with less elation than she had just before Carrie
arrived. The sizzle of the meat frying did not  sound quite so pleasing
now that Carrie had reported her discontent. To Carrie, the one relief
of the whole day would have been a jolly home, a sympathetic reception,
a bright supper table, and some one to say: " Oh, well stand it a
little while. You will get something better," put now this was ashes.
She began to see that they looked upon her complaint as unwarranted,
and that she was supposed to work on and say nothing. She knew that she
was to pay four dollar for her board and room, and now she felt that it
would be an exceedingly gloomy round living with these people.

Minnie was no companion for her sister-she was too old. Her thoughts
were staid and solemnly adapted to a condition. If Hanson had any
pleasant thoughts or happy feelings he concealed them. He seemed to do
all his  mental operations without the aid of physical expression. He
was as still as a deserted chamber. Carrie, on the  other hand, had the
blood of youth and some imagination. Her day of love and the mysteries
of courtship were still ahead. She could think of things she would like
to do, of clothes she would like to wear, and of places she would like
to visit. These were the things upon which her mind ran, and it was
like meeting with opposition at every turn to find no one here to call
forth or respond to her feelings.

She had forgotten, in considering and explaining the result of her day,
that Drouet might come. Now, when  she saw how unreceptive these two
people were, she hoped he would not. She did not know exactly what she
would do or how she would explain to Drouet, if he came. After supper
she changed her clothes. When she was trimly dressed she was rather a
sweet little being, with large eyes and a sad mouth. Her face expressed
the mingled expectancy, dissatisfaction, and depression she felt. She
wandered about after the dishes were put away, talked a little with
Minnie, and then decided to go down and stand in the door at the foot
of the stairs. If Drouet came, she could meet him there. Her face took
on the semblance of a look of happiness as she put on her hat to go
below.

" Carrie doesn't seem to like her place very well," said Minnie to her
husband when the latter came out, paper in hand, to sit in the dining-
room a few minutes.

" She ought to keep it for a time, anyhow," said Hanson. " Has she gone
downstairs?"

" Yes," said Minnie.

" I'd tell her to keep it if I were you. She might be here weeks
without getting another one."

Minnie said she would, and Hanson read his paper.

" If I were you," he said a little later, " I wouldn't let her stand in
the door down there. It don't look good."

" I'll tell her," said Minnie.

The life of the streets contained for a long time to interest Carrie.
She never wearied of wondering where the people in the cars were going
or what their enjoyments were. Her imagination trod a very narrow
round, always winding up at points which concerned money, looks,
clothes or enjoyment. She would have a far-off thought of Columbia City
now and then, or an irritating rush of feeling concerning her
experiences of the present day, but, on the whole, the little world
about her enlisted her whole attention.

The first floor of the building, of which Hanson's flat was the third,
was occupied by a bakery, and to this, while she was standing there,
Hanson came down to buy a loaf of bread. She was not aware of his
presence until he was quite near her.

" I'm after bread," was all he said as he passed. The contagion of
thought here demonstrated itself. While Hanson really came for bread,
the though dwelt with him that now he would see what Carrie was doing.
No sooner did he draw near her with that in mind than she felt it. Of
course, she had no understanding of what put it into her head, but,
nevertheless, it aroused in her the first shade of real antipathy to
him. She knew now that she did not like him. He was suspicious.

A though will color a world for us. The flow of Carrie's meditations
had been disturbed, and Hanson had not long gone upstairs before she
followed. She had realized with the lapse of the quarter hours that
Drouet was not coming, and somehow she felt a little resentful, a
little as if she had been forsaken-was not good enough. She  went
upstairs, where everything was silent. Minnie was sewing by a lamp at
the table. Hanson has already turned in for the night. In her weariness
and disappointment Carrie did no more than announce that she was  going
to bed.

" Yes, you'd better," returned Minnie. " You've got to get up early,
you know."

The morning was no better. Hanson was just going out the door as Carrie
came from her room. Minnie tried to talk with her during breakfast, but
there was not much of interest which they could mutually discuss. As on
the  previous morning, Carrie walked down town, for she began to
realize now that her four-fifty would not even allow her cat fare after
she paid her board. This seemed a miserable arrangement. But the
morning light swept away the first misgivings of the day, as morning
light is ever won't to do.

At the shoe factory she put in a long day, scarcely so wearisome as the
preceding, but considerably less novel. The head foreman, on his round,
stopped by her machine.

" Where did you come from?" he inquired.

" Mr. Brown hired me," she replied.

" Oh, he did, eh!" and then, " She that you keep things going."

The machine girls impressed her even less favorably. They seemed
satisfied with their lot, and were in a sense " common." Carrie had
more imagination than they She was not used to slang. Her instinct in
the matter of dress was naturally better. She disliked to listen to the
girl next to her, who was rather hardened by experience.

" I'm going to quit this," she heard her remark to her neighbor. " What
with the stipend and being up late, it's too much for me health."

They were free with the follows, young and old, about the place, and
exchanged banter in rude phrases, which at first shocked her. She saw
that she was taken to be of the same sort and addressed accordingly.

" Hello," remarked one of the stout-wristed sole-workers to her at
noon. " You're a daisy." He really expected to hear the common " Aw! go
chase yourself!" in return, and was sufficiently abashed, by Carrie's
silently moving away, to retreat, awkwardly grinning.

That night at the flat she was even more lonely-the dull situation was
becoming harder to endure. She could see that the Hassons seldom or
never had any company. Standing at the street door looking out, she
ventured to walk out a little way. Her easy gait and idle manner
attracted attention of an offensive but common sort. She was slightly
taken back at the overtures of a well-dressed man of thirty, who in
passing looked at her, reduced his pace, turned back, and said:

" Out for a little stroll, are you, this evening?"

Carrie looked at him in amazement, and then summoned sufficient
thoughts to reply: " Why, I don't know you," backing away as she did
so.

" Oh, that don't matter," said the other affably.

She bandied no more words with him, but hurried away, reaching her own
door quite out of breath. There was something in the man's look which
frightened her.

During the remainder of the week it was very much the same. One or two
nights she found herself too tried to walk home, and expended car fare.
She was not very strong, and sitting all day affected her back. She
went to bed one night before Hanson.

Transplantation is not always successful in the matter of flowers or
maidens. It requires sometimes a richer soil, a better atmosphere to
continue even a natural  growth. It would have been better if her
acclimatization had been more gradual-less rigid. She would have done
better if she had not secured a position so quickly, and had seen more
of the city which she constantly troubled to know about.

On the first morning it rained she found that she  no umbrella. Minnie
loaned her one of hers, which was worn and faded. There was the kind of
vanity in Carrie that troubled at this. She went to one of the great
department stores and bought herself one, using a dollar and a quarter
of her small store to pay for it.

" What did you do that for, Carrie?" asked Minnie, when she saw it.

" Oh, I need one," said Carrie.

" You foolish girl."

Carrie resented this, though she did not reply. She  was not going to
be a common shop-girl, she though; they need not think it, either.

One the first Saturday night Carrie paid her board, four dollars.
Minnie had a quaver of conscience as she took it, but did not know how
to explain to Hanson if she took less. That worthy gave up just four
dollar less toward the household expenses with a smile of satisfaction.
He contemplated increasing his Building and Loan payments. As for
Carrie, she studied over the problem of finding clothes and amusement
on fifty cents a week. She brooded over this until she was in a state
of mental rebellion.

" I'm going up the street for a walk," she said after supper.

" Not alone, are you? asked Hanson.

" Yes," returned Carrie.

" I wouldn't," said Minnie.

" I want to see something," said Carrie, and by the tone she put into
the last word they realized for the first time she was not pleased with
them.

" What's the matter with her?" asked Hanson, when she went into the
front room to get her hat.

" I don't know," said Minnie.

" Well, she ought to know better than to want to go out alone."

Carrie did not go very far, after all. She returned and stood in the
door. The next day they went out to Garfield Park, but it did not
please her. She did not look well enough. In the shop next day she
heard the highly colored reports which girls give of their trivial
amusements. They had been happy. On several days it rained and she used
up car fare. One night she got thoroughly that evening she sat alone in
the front room looking out upon the street, where the lights were
reflected on the wet pavements, thinking. She had imagination enough to
be moody.

On Saturday she paid another four dollars and pocketed her fifty cents
in despair. The speaking acquaintanceship which she formed with some of
the girls at the shop discovered to her the fact that they had more of
their earnings to use for themselves than she did. They had young  men
of the kind whom she, since her experience with Drouet, felt above, who
took them about. She came to thoroughly dislike the light-headed young
fellows of the shop. Not one of them had a show of refinement. She  saw
only their workday side.

There came a day when the first premonitory blast of winter swept over
the city. It scudded the fleecy clouds in the heavens, trailed long,
thin streamers of smoke from the tall stacks, and raced about the
streets and corners in sharp and sudden puffs. Carrie now felt the
problem of winter clothes. What was she to do? She had no winter
jacket, no hat, no shoes. It was difficult to speak to  Minnie about
this, but at last she summoned the courage.

" I don't know what I'm going to do about clothes," she said one
evening when they were together. " I need a hat."

Minnie looked serious.

" Why don't you keep part of your money and buy  yourself one?" she
suggested, worried over the situation which the withholding of Carrie's
money would create.

" I'd like to for a week or so, if you don't mind," ventured Carrie.

" Could you pay two dollars?" asked Minnie.

Carrie readily acquiesced, glad to escape the trying situation, and
liberal now that she saw a way out. She was  elated and began figuring
at once. She needed a hat first of all. How Minnie explained to Hanson
she never knew. He said nothing at all, but there were thoughts in the
air which left disagreeable impressions.

The new arrangement might have worked if sickness had not intervened.
It blew up cold after a rain one afternoon when Carrie was still
without a jacket. She came out of the warm shop at six and shivered as
the wind struck her. In the morning she was sneezing, and going down
town made it worse. That day her bones ached and she felt light-headed.
Towards evening she felt very ill, and when she reached home was not
hungry. Minnie  noticed her drooping actions and asked her about
herself.

" I don't know," said Carrie. " I feel real bad."

She hung about the stove, suffered a chattering chill, and went to bed
sick. The next morning she was thoroughly feverish.

Minnie was truly distressed at this, but maintained a kindly demeanor.
Hanson said perhaps she had better  go back home for a while. When she
got up after three days, it was taken for granted that her position was
lost. The winter was near at hand, she had no clothes, and now she was
out of work.

" I don't know," said Carrie; " I'll go down Monday and see if I can't
get something."

If anything, her efforts were more poorly rewarded on  this trail than
the last. Her clothes were nothing suitable  for fall wearing. Her last
money she had spent for a hat. For three days she wandered about,
utterly dispirited. The attitude of the flat was fast becoming
unbearable. She hated to think of going back there each evening. Hanson
was so cold. She knew it could not last much longer. Shortly she would
have to give up and go home.

On the fourth day she was down town all day, having  borrowed ten cents
for lunch from Minnie. She had applied in the cheapest kind of places
without success. She even answered for a waitress in a small restaurant
where she saw a card in the window, but they wanted an experienced
girl. She moved through the thick throng of strangers, utterly subdued
in spirit. Suddenly a hand pulled her arm and turned her about.

" Well, well!" said a voice. In the first glance she beheld Drouet. He
was not only rosy-cheeked, but radiant. He was the essence of sunshine
and good-humor.

" Why, how are you, Carrie?" he said. " You're a daisy

Where have been?"

Carrie smiled under his irresistible flood of geniality.

" I've been out home," she said.

" Well," he said, " I saw you across the street there. I thought it was
you. I was just coming out to your place.

How are you, anywhere?"

" I'm all right," said Carrie, smiling.

Drouet looked her over and saw something different.

" Well," he said, " I want to talk to you. You're not going anywhere in
particular, are you?"

" Not just now," said Carrie.

" Let's go up here and have something to eat. George! but I'm glad to
see you again."

She felt so relieved in his radiant presence, so much though with the
slightest air of holding back.

" Well," he said, as he took her arm-and there was an  exuberance of
good-fellowship in the word which fairly warmed the cockles of her
heart.

They went through Monroe Street to the old Windson dining-room, which
was then a large, comfortable place with an excellent cuisine and
substantial service. Drouet selected a table close by the window, where
the busy route of the street could be seen. He loved the changing
panorama of the street-to see and be seen as he dined.

" Now," he said, getting Carrie and himself comfortably settled, " what
will you have?"

Carrie looked over the large bill of fare which the waiter handed her
without really considering it. She was very hungry, and the things she
saw there awakened her desires, but the high prices held her attention.
" Half broiled spring chicken-seventy-five. Sirloin steak with
mushrooms-one twenty-five." She had dimly heard of  these things, but
it seemed strange to be called to order from the list.

" I'll fix this," exclaimed Drouet. " Sst! waiter."

That officer of the board, a full-chested, round-faced negro,
approached, and inclined his ear.

" Sirloin with mushrooms," said Drouet. " Stuffed tomatoes."

" Yassah," assented the negro, nodding his head.

" Hashed brown potatoes."

" Yassah."

" Asparagus."

" Yassah."

" And a pot of coffee."

Drouet turned to Carrie. " I haven't had a thing since breakfast. Just
got in from Rock Island. I was going off to dine when I saw you."

Carrie smiled and smiled.

" What have you been doing?" he went on. " Tell me all about yourself.
How is your sister?"

" She's well," returned Carrie, answering the last query.

He looked at her hard.

" Say," he said," you haven't been sick, have you?"

Carrie nodded.

" Well, now that's a blooming shame, isn't it? You  don't look very
well. I thought you looked a little pale.

What have you been doing?"

" Working," said Carrie.

" You don't say so! At what?"

She told him.

" Rhodes, Morgenthua and Scott-why I know that  house. Over here on
Fifth Avenue, isn't it? They're a  close-fisted concern. What made you
go there?"

" I couldn't get anything else," said Carrie frankly.

" Well, that's an outrage," said Drouet. " You oughtn't to be working
for those people. Have the factory right back of the store, don't
they?"

" Yes," said Carrie.

" That isn't a good house," said Drouet. " You don't want to work at
anything like that, anyhow."

He chattered on at a great rate, asking questions, explaining things
about himself, telling her what a good restaurant it was, until the
waiter returned with an immense tray, bearing the hot savory dished
which had been ordered. Drouet fairly shone in the matter of serving.
He appeared to great advantage behind the white  napery and silver
platters of the table and displaying his arms with a knife and fork. As
he cut the meat his rings almost spoke. His new suit creaked as he
stretched to  helped Carrie to a rousing plateful and contributed the
warmth of his spirit to her body until she was a new girl. He was a
splendid fellow in the true popular understanding of the term, and
captivated Carrie completely.

That little soldier of fortune took her good turn in an easy way. She
felt a little out of place, but the great room soothed her and the view
of the well-dressed throng outside seemed a splendid thing. Ah, what
was it not to  have money! What a thing it was to be able to come in
here and dine! Drouet must be fortunate. He rod on trains, dressed in
such nice clothes, was so strong, and ate in these fine places. He
seemed quite a figure of  a man, and she wondered at his friendship and
regard for her.

" So you lost your place because you got sick, eh?" he said. " What are
you going to do now?"

" Look around," she said, a thought of the need that  hung outside this
fine restaurant like a hungry dog at her wheels passing into her eyes.

" Oh, no," said Drouet, " that won't do. How long have you been
looking?"

" Four days," she answered.

" Think of that!" he said, addressing some problematical individual. "
You oughtn't to be doing anything like that. These girls," and he waved
an inclusion of all shop and factory girls, " don't get anything. Why,
you can't  live on it, can you?"

He was a brotherly sort of creature in his demeanor. When he had
scouted the idea of that kind of toil, he took another tack. Carrie was
really very pretty. Even then in her commonplace garb, her figure was
evidently not bad, and her eyes were large and gentle. Drouet looked at
her and his thoughts reached home. She felt his admiration. It was
powerfully backed by his liberality and good-humor. She felt that she
liked him-that she could continue to like him ever so much. There was
something even richer than that, running as a hidden strain, in her
mind. Every little while her eyes would meet his, and by that means the
interchanging current of feeling would be fully connected.

" Why don't you stay down town and go to the theatre with me?" he said,
hitching his chair closer. The table was not very wide.

" Oh, I can't," she said.

" What are you going to do to-night?"

" Nothing," she answered, a little drearily.

" You don't like out there where you are, do you?"

" Oh I don't know."

" What are you going to do if you don't get work?"

" Go back home, I guess."

There was least quaver in her voice as she said this. Somehow, the
influence he was exerting was powerful. They came to an understanding
of each other without words-he of her situation. she of the fact that
he realized it.

" No," he said, " you can't make it!" genuine sympathy filling his mind
for the time. " Let me help you. You take some of my money"

" Oh, no! she said, leaning back.

" What are you going to do?" he said.

She sat meditating, merely shaking her head.

He looked at her quite tenderly for his kind. There were some loose
bills in his vest pocket-greenbacks They were soft and noiseless, and
he got his fingers about them and crumpled them up in his hand.

" Carrie on," he said, " I'll see you through all right. Get yourself
some clothes."

It was the first reference he had made to that subject, and now she
realized how bad off she was. In his crude way he had struck the key-
note. Her lips trembled a little.

She had her hand out on the table before her. They were quite alone in
their corner, and he put his larger, warmer hand over it.

" Aw, come, Carrie," he said, " what can you do alone? Let me help
you."

He pressed her hand gently and she tried to withdraw it. At this he
held it fast, and she no longer protested. Then he slipped the
greenbacks he had into her palm, and when she began to protest, he
whispered:

" I'll loan to you-that's all right. I'll loan it to you."

He made her take it. She felt bound to him by a  strange tie of
affection now. They went out, and he walked with her take it. She felt
bound to him by a  walked with her far out south toward Polk Street,
talking.

" You don't want to live with those people?" he said in one place,
abstractedly. Carrie heard it, but it made only  a slight impression.

" Could down and meet me to-morrow," he said, " and we'll go to the
matinee. Will you?

Carrie protested a while, but acquiesced.

" You're not doing anything. Get yourself a nice pair of shoes and a
jacket."

She scarcely gave a though to the complication which would trouble her
when he was gone. In his presence, she was of his own hopeful, easy-
way-out mood.

" Don't you bother about those people out there," he said at parting. "
I'll help you."

Carrie left him, feeling as though a great arm had slipped out before
her to draw off trouble. The money  she had accepted was two soft,
green, handsome ten dollar bills.


Chapter VII
THE LURE OF THE MATERIAL: BEAUTY SPEAKS FORITSELF

The true meaning of money yet remains to be popularly explained and
comprehended. When each individual realizes for himself that this thing
primarily stands for and should only be accepted as a moral due-that it
should  be paid out as honestly stored energy, and not as a  usurped
privilege-many of our social, religious, and political troubles will
have permanently passed. As for Carrie, her understanding of the moral
significance of money was the popular understanding, nothing more. The
old definition: " Money : something everybody else has had and I must
get," would have expressed her understanding of it thoroughly. Some of
it she now held in her hand-two soft, green ten-dollar bills-and she
felt that she was immensely better off for the having of them. It was
something that was power in itself. One of her order of mind would have
been content to be cast away upon a desire island with a bundle of
money, and only the long strain of starvation would have taught her
that in some cases it could have no value. Even then she would have had
no conception of the relative value of the thing; her one thought
would, undoubtedly, have concerned the pity of having so much power and
the inability to use it.

The poor girl thrilled as she walked away from Drouet. She felt ashamed
in part because she had been weak enough to take it, but her need was
so dire, she was still glad. Now she would have a nice jacket! Now she
would buy a nice pair button shoes. She would  get stockings too, and
skirts, and, and-until already, as in matter of her desires, twice the
purchasing power of her bills. She conceived a true estimate of Drouet.
To her, and indeed to all the world, he was a nice, good-hearted, as in
the matter of her prospective salary, she had got beyond, in her
desires, twice the purchasing power of her bills.

She conceived a true estimate of Drouet. To her, and indeed to all the
world, he was a nice, good-hearted man. There was nothing evil in the
fellow. He gave her the want. He would not have given the same amount
to a poor young man, but we must not forget that a poor young man could
not, in the nature of things, have appealed to him like a poor young
girl. Femininity affected his feelings. He was the creature of an
inborn desire. Yet no beggar could have caught his eye and said, " My
God, mister, I'm starving," but he would gladly have handed out what
was considered the proper portion to give beggars and though no more
about it. There  would have been no speculation, no philosophizing. He
had no mental process in him worthy the dignity of either of those
terms. In his good clothes and fine health, he was a merry, unthinking
moth of the lamp. Deprived of his position, and struck by a few of the
involved and baffling forces which sometimes play upon man, he would
have been as helpless as Carrie-as helpless, as nonunderstanding, as
pitiable, if you will, as she.

Now, in regard to his pursuit of women, he meant them no harm, because
he did not conceive of the relation which he hoped to hold with them as
being harmful. He loved to make advances to women, to have them succumb
to his charms, not because his inborn desire urged him to that as a
chief delight. He was vain, he was boastful, he was as deluded by fine
clothes as any silly-headed girl. As truly deep-dyed villain could have
hornswaggled him as readily as he could have flattered a pretty shop-
girl. His fine success as a salesman lay in his geniality and the
thoroughly reputable standing of his house. He bobbed about among men,
a veritable bundle of enthusiasm-no power worthy the name of intellect,
no thoughts worthy the adjectives noble, no feelings long continued in
one strain. A Madame Sappho would have called him a pig; a Shakespeare
would have said " my merry child;" old, drinking Caryoe thought him a
clever, successful business man. In short, he was as good as his
intellect conceived.

The best proof that there was something open and commendable about the
man was the fact that Carrie took the money. No deep, sinister soul
with ulterior motives could have given her fifteen cents under the
guise of friendship. The unintellectual are not so helpless. Nature has
taught the beasts of the field to fly when some, unheralded danger
threatens. She has put into the small, unwise head of the chipmunk the
untutored dear of poisons. " He keepeth His creatures whole," was not
written of beasts alone. Carrie was unwise, and, therefore, like the
sheep in its unwisdom, strong in feeling. The instinct of self-
protection, strong in all such natures, was roused but feebly, if at
all, by the overtures of Drouet.

When Carrie had gone, he felicitated himself  upon her good opinion. By
George, it was shame young girls had to be knocked around like that.
Cold weather coming on and no clothes. Tough. He would  go around to
Fitzgerald and Moy's and get a cigar. It made him feel light of foot as
he thought about her.

Carrie reached home in high good spirits, which she could scarcely
conceal. The possession of the money involved a number of points which
perplexed her seriously. He should she buy any clothes when Minnie knew
that  she had no money? She had no sooner entered the flat than this
point was settled for her. It could not be done. She could think of no
way of explaining.

" How did you come out?" asked Minnie, referring to the day.

Carrie had none of the small deception which could feel one thing and
say something directly opposed. She  would prevaricate, but it would be
in the line of her feelings, at least. So instead of complaining when
she felt  so good, she said:

" I have the promise of something."

" Where?"

" At the Boston Store."

" Is it sure promised?" questioned Minnie.

" Well, I'm to find out to-morrow," returned Carrie disliked to draw
out a lie any longer than was necessary.

Minnie felt the atmosphere of good feeling which Carrie brought with
her. She felt now was the time to express to Carrie the state of
Hanson's feeling about her entire Chicago venture.

" If you shouldn't get it-" she paused, troubled for an easy way.

" If I don't get something pretty soon, I think I'll go home."

Minnie saw her chance.

" Sven thinks it might be best for the winter, anyhow."

The situation flashed on Carrie at once. They were unwilling to keep
her any longer, out of work. She did not blame Minnie, she did not
blame Hanson very much. Now, as she sat there digesting the remark, she
was glad  she had Drouet's money.

" Yes," she said after a few moments, " I thought of doing that."

She did not explain that the though, however, had aroused all the
antagonism of her nature. Columbia  City, what was there for her? She
knew its dull little round by heart. Here was the great, mysterious
city which was still a magnet for her. What she had seen only suggested
its possibilities. Now to turn back on it and live the little old life
out there-she almost exclaimed against the thought.

She had reached home early and went in the front room to think. What
could she do? She could not buy new shoes and wear them here. She would
need to save part of the twenty to pay her fare home. She did not want
to  borrow of Minnie for that. And yet how could she explain where she
even got that money? If she could only get enough to let her out easy.

She went over the tangle again and again. Here, in the morning, Drouet
would expect to see her in a new jacket, and that couldn't be. The
Hansons expected her to go home, and she wanted to get away, and yet
she did not want to go home. In the light of the way they would look on
her getting money without work, the taking of it now seemed dreadful.
She began to be ashamed. The whole situation depressed her. It was all
so clear when she was with Drouet. Now it was all so tangled, so
hopeless-much worse than it was before, because she had the  semblance
of aid in her hand which she could not use.

Her spirits sank so that at supper Minnie felt that she must have had
another hard day. Carrie finally decided that she would give the money
back. It was wrong to take it. She would go down in the morning and
hunt for work. At noon she would meet Drouet as agreed and tell him. At
this decision her heart sank, until she was the  old Carrie of
distress.

Curiously, she could not hold the money in her hand without feeling
some relief. Even after all her depressing conclusions, she could sweep
away all thought about the matter and then the twenty dollars seemed a
wonderful and delightful thing. Ah, money, money, money! What a thing
it was to have. How plenty of it would clear away all these troubles.

In the morning she got up and started out a little early. Her decision
to hunt for work was moderately strong, but  the money in her pocket,
after all her troubling over it, made the work question the least shade
less terrible. She walked into the wholesale district, but as the
thought of applying came with each passing concern, her heart shrank.
What a coward she was, she thought to herself. Yet she had applied so
often. It would be the same old story. She walked on and on, and
finally did go into one place, with the old result. She came out
feeling that luck was against her. It was no use.

Without much thinking, she reached Dearborn Street. Here was the great
Fair store with its multitude of delivery wagons about, its long window
display, its crowd of shoppers. It readily changed her thoughts, she
who was so weary of them. It was here that she had intended to come and
get her new things. Now for relief from distress; she thought she would
go in and see. She would look at the jackets.

There is nothing in this world more delightful than that  middle state
in which we mentally balance at times, possessed of the means, lured by
desire, and yet deterred by conscience or what of decision. When Carrie
began wandering around the store amid the fine displays she was in this
mood. Her original experience in this same place had given her a high
opinion of its merits. Now she paused at each individual bit of finery,
where before she had hurried on. Her woman's heart was warm with desire
for them. How would she look in this, how charming that would make her!
She came upon the corset counter and pauses in rich reverie as she
noted the dainty concoctions of color and lace their displayed. If she
would only make up her mind, she could have one or those now. She
lingered in the jewelry department. She saw the earrings, the
bracelets, the pins, the chains. What would she not have given if she
could have had them all! She would look fine too, if only she had some
of these things.

The jackets were the greatest attraction. When she entered the store,
she already had her heart fixed upon the peculiar little tan jacket
with large mother-of-pearl buttons which was all the rage that fall.
Still she delighted to convince herself that there was nothing she
would like better. She went about among the glass cases and racks where
these things were displayed, and satisfied herself that the one she
thought of was the proper one. All the time she wavered in mind, now
persuading herself  that she could buy it right away if she chose, now
recalling to herself the actual condition. At last the noon hour was
dangerously near, and she had done nothing. She  must go now and return
the money.

Drouet was on the corner when she came up.

" Hello," he said, " where is the jacket and"-looking down-" the
shoes?"

Carrie had thought lead up to her decision in some intelligent way, but
this swept the whole fore-schemed situation by the board.

" I came to tell you that-that I can't take the money."

" Oh, that's it, is it?" he returned. " Well, you come on with me.
Let's go over here to Partridge's."

Carrie walked with him. Behold, the whole fabric of doubt and
impossibility had slipped from her mind. She  could not get at the
points that were so serious, the things she was going to make plain to
him.

" Have you had lunch yet? Of course you haven't. Let's go in here," and
Drouet turned into one of the very nicely furnished restaurants off
State Street, in Monroe.

" I mustn't take money," said Carrie, after they were settled in a cozy
corner, and Drouet had ordered the lunch. " I can't wear those things
out there. They  wouldn't know where I got them."

" What do you want to do," he smiled, " go without them?"

" I think I'll go home," she said, wearily.

" Oh, come," he said, " you've been thinking it over too long. I'll
tell you what you do. You rent a furnished room and leave them in that
for a week?"

Carrie shook her head. Like all women, she was there to object and be
convinced. It was for him to brush the doubts away and clear the path
if he could.

" Why are you going home?" he asked.

" Oh, I can't get anything here."

" They won't keep you?" he remarked, intuitively.

" They can't" said Carrie.

" I'll tell you what you do," he said. " You come with me. I'll take
care of you."

Carrie heard this passively. The peculiar state which she was in made
it sound like the welcome breath of an  open door. Drouet seemed of her
own spirit and pleasing. He was clean, handsome, well-dressed, and
sympathetic. His voice was the voice of a friend.

" What can you do back at Columbia City?" he went on, rousing by the
words in Carrie's mind a picture of the  dull world she had left. "
There isn't anything down there. Chicago's the place. You can get a
nice room.

Carrie looked out through the window into the busy street. There it
was, the admirable, great city, so fine sing pair of bays, passed by,
carrying in its upholstered depths a young lady.

" What will you have if you go back?" asked Drouet. There was no subtle
undercurrent to the question. He imagined that she would have nothing
at all of the things he thought worth while.

Carrie sat still, looking out. She was wondering what she could do.
They would be expecting her to go home this week.

Drouet turned to the subject of the clothes she was going to buy.

" Why not get yourself a nice little jacket? You've got to have it.
I'll loan you the money. You needn't worry  about taking it. You can
get yourself a nice room by yourself. I won't hurt you."

Carrie saw the drift, but could not express her thoughts. She felt more
than ever the helplessness of her case.

" If I could only get something to do," she said.

" Maybe you can," went on Drouet, " if you stay here. You can't if you
go away. They won't let you stay out there. Now, why not let me get you
a nice room? I won't bother you needn't be afraid. Then, when  you get
fixed up, maybe you could get something."

He looked at her pretty face and vivified his mental resources. She was
a sweet little mortal to him-there was no doubt of that. She seemed to
have some power back of her actions. She was not like the common run of
store-girls. She wasn't silly.

In reality, Carrie had more imagination than he-more taste. It was a
finer mental strain in her that made possible her depression and
loneliness. Her poor clothes were neat, and she held her head
unconsciously in a dainty way.

" DO you think I could get something?" she asked.

" Sure," he said, reaching over and filling her cup with tea. " I'll
help you."

She looked at him, and he laughed reassuringly.

" Now I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll go over her to Partridge's and
you pick out what you want. The we'll look around for a room for you.
You can leave the things there. Then we'll go to the show to-night."

Carrie shook her head.

" We'll, you can go out to the flat them, that's all right You don't
need to stay in the room. Just take it and leave your things there."

She hung in doubt about this until the dinner was over.

" Let's go over and look at the jackets," he said.

Together they went. In the store they found that  shine and rustle of
new things which immediately laid hold of Carrie's heart. Under the
influence of a good dinner and Drouet's radiating presence, the scheme
proposed seemed feasible. She looked about and picked a  jacket like
the one which she had admired at The Fair. When she got it in her hand
it seemed so much nicer. The saleswoman helped her on with it, and, by
accident it fitted perfectly. Drouet's face lightened as he saw the
improvement. She looked quite smart.

" That's the thing," he said.

Carrie turned  before the glass. She could not help feeling pleased as
she looked at herself. A warm glow crept into her cheeks.

" That's the thing," said Drouet. " Now pay for it."

" It's nine dollar," said Carrie.

" That's all right-take it," said Drouet.

She reached in her purse and took out one of the bills. The woman asked
if she would wear the coat and went  off. In a few minutes she was back
and the purchase was closed.

From Partridge's they went to a shoe store, where Carrie was fitted for
shoes. Drouet stood by, and when he saw how nice they looked, said, "
Wear them." Carrie shook her head, however. She was thinking of running
to the flat. He brought her a purse for one thing and a pair of gloves
for another, and let her buy the stockings.

" To-morrow," he said, " you come down here and buy yourself a skirt."
	In all of Carrie's actions there was a touch of misgiving. The
deeper she sank into the entanglement, the more she imagined that the
thing hung upon the few remaining things she had not done. Since she
had not done these, there was a way out.

Drouet knew a place in Wabash Avenue where there were rooms. He showed
Carrie the outside of these, and said: " Now, you're my sister." He
carried to the selection looking around, criticizing, opining. " Her
trunk will be here in a day or so, he observed to the landlady, who was
very pleased.

When they went alone, Drouet did not change in the  least. He talked in
the same general way as if they were out in the street. Carrie left her
things.

" Now," said Drouet, " why don't you move to-night?"

" Oh, I can't," said Carrie.

" Why not?"

" I don't want to leave them so."

He took that up as they walked along the avenue. It was a warm
afternoon. The sun had come out and the wind had died down. As he
talked with Carrie, he secured an accurate detail of the atmosphere of
the flat.

" Come out of it," he said, " they won't care. I'll help you get
along."

She listened until her misgiving vanished. He would show her about a
little and then help her get something. He really imagined that he
would. He would be out on the road and she could be working.

" Now, I'll tell you what you do," you go out there and get whatever
you want and come away."

She though a long time about this. Finally she agreed. He would come
out as far as Peoria Street and wait for her. She was to meet him at
half-past eight. At half-past five she reached home, and at six her
determination was hardened.

" So you didn't get it?" said Minnie, referring to Carrie's story of
the Boston Store.

Carrie looked at her out of the corner of her eye. " No," she answered.

" I don't think you'd better try any more this fall," said Minnie.

Carrie said nothing.

When Hanson came home he wore the same inscrutable demeanor. He washed
in silence and went off to read his paper. At dinner Carrie felt a
little nervous. The strain of her own plans was considerable, and the
feeling that she was not welcome here was strong.

" Didn't find anything, eh?" said Hanson.

" No."

He turned to his eating again, the though that it was a burden to have
her here dwelling in his mind. She  would have to go home, that was
all. Once she was away, there would be no more coming back in the
spring

Carrie was afraid of what she was going to do, but she was relieved to
know that this condition was ending. They would not care. Hanson
particularly would be glad when she went. He would not care what became
of her.

After dinner she went into the bathroom, where they could not disturb
her, and wrote a little note.

" Good-bye, Minnie," it read. " I'm not going home. I'm going to stay
in Chicago a little while and look for work. Don't worry. I'll be all
right."

In the front room Hanson was reading his paper. As usual, she helped
Minnie clear away the dishes and  straighten up. Then she:

" I guess I'll stand down at the door a little while." She could
scarcely prevent her voice from trembling.

Minnie remembered Hanson's remonstrance.

" Sven doesn't think it looks good to stand down there," she said.

" Doesn't he?" said Carrie. " I won't do it any more after this."

She put on her hat and fidgeted around the table in the  little
bedroom, wondering where to slip the note. Finally she put it under
Minnie's hair-brush.

When she had closed the hall-door, she paused a moment and wondered
what they would think. Some thought of the queerness of her deed
affected her. She went slowly down the stairs. She looked back up the
lighted step, and then affected to stroll up the street. When she
reached the corner she quickened her pace.

As she was hurrying away, Hanson came back to his wife.

" Is Carrie down at the door again?" he asked.

" Yes, said Minnie; " she said she wasn't going to do it any more."

He went over to the baby where it was playing on the floor and began to
poke his finger at it.

Drouet was on the corner waiting, in good spirits.

" Hello, Carrie," he said, as a sprightly figure of a girl drew near
him. " Got here safe, did you? Well, we'll take a car."


Chapter VIII
INTIMATIONS BY WINTER: AN AMBASSADOR SUMMONER

 Among the force which sweep and play throughout the universe,
untutored man is but a wisp in the wind. Our civilization is still in a
middle stage, scarcely beast in that it is no longer wholly guided by
instinct; scarcely human, in that it is not yet wholly guided by
reason. On  the tiger no responsibility rests. We see him aligned by
nature with the forces of life-he is born into their keeping and
without though he is protected. We see man far removed from the lairs
of the jungles, his innate instincts dulled by too near an approach to
free-will, his free-will not sufficiently developed to replace his
instincts and afford him perfect guidance. He is becoming too wise to
hearken always to instincts and desires; he is still too weak to always
prevail against them. As a beast, the forces of life aligned him with
them; with the forces. In this intermediate stage he wavers-neither
drawn in her money with nature by his instincts nor yet wisely putting
himself into harmony by his own free-will. He is even as wisp in the
wind, moved by every breath of passion, acting now by his will and now
by his instincts, erring with one, only-a creature of incalculable
variability. We have the consolation of knowing that evolution is ever
in action, that the ideal is a light that cannot fail. He will not
forever balance thus between good and evil. When this jangle of free-
will and instinct shall have been adjusted, when perfect understanding
has given the former the power to replace the latter entirely, man will
no longer vary. The nettle of understanding will yet point steadfast
and unwavering to the distant pole of truth.

In Carrie-as in how many of our wordings do they not?-instinct and
reason, desire and understanding, were at war for the mastery. She
followed whither her craving led. She was as yet more drawn than she
drew.

When Minnie found the note next morning, after a  night of mingled
wonder and anxiety, which was not exactly touched by yearning, sorrow,
or love, she exclaimed:

" Well, what do you think of that?"

" What?" said Hanson.

" Sister Carrie has gone to live somewhere else."

Hanson jumped out of bed with more celerity than he usually displayed
and looked at the note. The only indication of his thoughts came in the
form of a little clicking sound made by his tongue; the sound some
people  make when they wish to urge on a horse.

" Where do you suppose she's gone to?" said Minnie thoroughly aroused.

" I don't know," a touch of cynicism lighting his eye.

" Now she has gone and done it."

Minnie moved her head in a puzzled way.

" Oh, oh," she said, " she doesn't know what she has done."

" Well," said Hanson after a while, sticking his hands out before him,
" what can you do?"

Minnie's womanly nature was higher than this. She figured the
possibilities in such cases.

" Oh," she said at least, " poor Sister Carrie!"

At the time of this particular conversation, which occurred at 5 am,
that little soldier of fortune was sleeping in rather troubled sleep in
her new room, alone.

Carrie's new state was remarkable in that she saw possibilities in it.
She was no sensualist, longing to drowse sleepily in the lap of luxury.
She turned about, troubled  by her daring, glad of her release,
wondering whether she would get something to do, wondering what Drouet
would do. That worthy had his future fixed for him beyond a
peradventure. He could not see clearly enough to wish to do
differently. He was drawn by his innate desire to act the old pursuing
part. He would need to delight himself with Carrie as surely as he
would need to eat his heavy breakfast. He might suffer the least
rudimentary  twinge of conscience in whatever he did, and in just so
far he was evil and sinning. But whatever twinges of conscience he
might have would be rudimentary, you may be sure.

The next day he called upon Carrie, and she saw him in her chamber. He
was the same jolly, enlivening soul.

" Aw," he said, " what are you looking so blue about? Come on out to
breakfast. You want to get your other clothes to-day."

Carrie looked at him with the hew of shifting thought in her large
eyes.

" I wish I could get something to do," she said.

" You'll get that all right," said Drouet. " What's the use worrying
right now? Get yourself fixed up. See the city. I won't hurt you."

" I know you won't," she remarked, half truthfully.

" Got on the new shoes, haven't you? Stick 'em out George, they look
fine. Put on your jacket."

Carrie obeyed.

" Say, that fits like a T, don't it?" he remarked, feeling the set of
it at the waist and eyeing it from a few paces with real pleasure. "
What you need now is a new shirt. Let's go to breakfast."

Carrie put on her hat.

" Where are the gloves?" he inquired.

" Here," she said, taking them out of the bureau drawer.

" Now, come on," he said.

Thus the first hour of misgiving was swept away.

It went this way on every occasion. Drouet did not leave her much
alone. She had time for some lone wanderings, but mostly he filled her
hours with skirt and shirt waist. With his money she purchased the
little necessaries of toilet, until at last she looked quite another
maiden. The mirror convinced her of a few things which she had long
believed. She was pretty, yes, indeed! How nice her had set, and
weren't her eyes pretty. She caught her little red lip with her teeth
and felt her first thrill of power Drouet was so good.

They went to see " The Mikado" one evening, an open which was
hilariously popular at that time. Before going they made off for the
Windsor dinning-room, which was in Dearborn Street, a considerable
distance from Carrie's room. It was blowing up cold, and out of her
window. Carrie could see the western sky, still pink with the fading
light, but steely blue at the top where it met the darkness. A long,
thin cloud of pink hung in midair, shape like some island in a far-off
sea. Somehow the swaying  of some dead branches of trees across the way
brought back the picture with which she was familiar when she looked
from their front window in December days a home.

She paused and wrung her little hands.

" What's the matter?" said Drouet.

" Oh, I don't know," she said, her lip trembling.

He sensed something, and slipped his arm over her shoulder, patting her
arm.

" Come on," he said gently, " you're all right."

She turned to slip on her jacket.

" Better wear that boa about throat to-night."

They walked north on Wabash to Adams Street and then west. The lights
in the stores were already shinning out in gushes of golden hue. The
are lights were sputtering overhead, and high up were the lighted
window of the tall office buildings. The chill wind whipped in and out
in gusty breaths. Homeward bound, the six o'clock  throng bumped and
jostled. Light overcoats were turned up about the ears, hats were
pulled down. Little shop girls went fluttering by in pairs and fours,
chattering, laughing. It was a spectacle of warm-blooded humanity.

Suddenly a pair of eye met Carrie's in recognition. They were looking
out from a group of poorly dressed girls. Their clothes were faded and
loose-hanging, their jackets old, their general make-up shabby.

Carrie recognized the glance and the girl. She was one of those who
worked at the machines in the shoe factory. The latter looked, Carrie
felt as if some great tide had rolled between them. The old dress and
the old machine came back. She actually started. Drouet didn't notice

until Carrie bumped into a pedestrian.

" You must be thinking," he said.

They dined and went to the theatre. That spectacle pleased Carrie
immensely. The color and grace of it caught her eye. She had vain
imaginings about place. and power, about far-off lands and magnificent
people. When it was over, the clatter of coaches and the throng of fine
ladies made her stare.

" Wait a minute," said Drouet, holding her back in the showy foyer
where ladies and gentlemen were moving in a social crush, skirts
rustling, lace-covered heads nodding, white teeth showing through
parted lips. " Let's  see."

" Sixty-seven," the coach-caller was saying, his voice lifted in a sort
of euphonious cry. " Sixty-seven."

" Isn't it fine?" said Carrie.

" Great," said Drouet. He was as much affected by this show of finery
and gayety as she. He pressed her arm warmly. Once she looked up, her
even teeth glistening through her smiling lips, her eyes alight. As
they were moving out he whispered down to her, " You look lovely!" They
were right where the coach-caller was swinging open a coach-door and
ushering in two ladies.

" You stick to me and we'll have a coach." laughed Drouet.

Carrie scarcely heard, her head was so full of the swig of life.

They stopped in at a restaurant for a little after-theater lunch. Just
a shade of a though of the hour entered Carrie's head, but there was no
household law to govern her now. If any habits ever had time to fix
upon her things. They will drive the really non-religious mind out of
bed to say prayers that are only a custom and not a devotion. The
victim of habit, when he had neglected the thing which it was his
custom to do, feels a little scratching in the brain, a little
irritating something which comes of being out of the rut, and images it
to be that  prick of conscience, the still, small voice that is urging
him ever to righteousness. If the digression is unusual enough, the
drag of habit will be heavy enough to cause the unreasoning victim to
return and perform the perfunctory thing. " Now, bless me, as a matter
of fact, it has merely done its old, unbreakable trick once again.

Carrie had no excellent home principles fixed upon her. If she had, she
would have been more consciously distressed. Now the lunch went off
with considerable warmth. Under the influence of the varied
occurrences, the fine, invisible passion which was emanating from
Drouet, the food, the still unusual luxury, she relaxed and heard with
open ears. She was again the victim of the  city's hypnotic influence.

" Well," said Drouet at last, " we had better be going."

They had been dawdling over the dishes, and their eyes had frequently
met. Carrie could not help but feel the vibration of force which
followed, which, indeed, was his gaze. He had a way of touching her
hand in explanation, as if to impress a fact upon her. He touched it
now as he spoke of going.

They arose and went out into the street. The downtown section was now
bare, save for a few whistling strollers, a few owl cars, a few open
resorts whose windows were still bright. Out Wabash Avenue they
strolled Drouet still pouring forth his volume of small information. He
had Carrie's arm in his, and held it closely as be explained. Once in a
while, after some witticism, he would look down, and his eyes would
meet hers. At last they came to the steps, and Carrie stood up on the
first one, her hand head now coming even with his own. He took her hand
and held it genially. He looked steadily at her as she glanced about,
warmly musing.

At about that hour, Minnie was soundly sleeping, after a long evening
of troubled thought. She had her elbow in an awkward position under her
side. The muscles so held irritated a few nerves, and now a vague scene
floated in on the drowsy mind. She fancied she and Carrie were
somewhere beside an old coal-mine. She could see the  tall runway and
the heap of earth and coal cast out. There was a deep pit, into which
they were looking; they could see the curious wet stones far down where
the wall disappeared in vague shadows. An old basket, used for
descending, was hanging there, fastened by a worn rope.

" Let's get in," said Carrie.

" Oh, no," said Minnie.

" Yes, come on," said Carrie.

She began to pull the basket over, and now, in spite of all protest,
she had swung over and was going down.

" Carrie," she called, " Carrie, come back;" but Carrie was far down
now and the shadow had swallowed her completely.

She moved her arm.

Now the mystic scenery merged queerly and the place was by waters she
had never seen. They were upon some board or ground or something that
reached far out, and at the end of this was Carrie. They looked about,
and now the thing was sinking, and Minnie heard the low sip of the
encroaching water.

" Come on, Carrie," she called, but Carrie was reaching farther out.
She seemed to recede, and now it was difficult to call to her.

" Carrie," she called, " Carrie," but her own voice sounded far away,
and the strange waters were blurring everything. She came away
suffering as though she had lost something. She was more inexpressibly
sad thus she had ever been in life.

It was this way through many shifts of the tired brain, those curious
phantoms of the spirit slipping in, blurring strange scenes, one with
the other. The last one made  her cry out, for Carrie was slipping away
somewhere over a rock, and her fingers had let loose and she had seen
her falling.

" Minnie! What's the matter? Here, wake up," said Hanson, disturbed,
and shaking her by the shoulder.

" Wha-what's the matter?" said Minnie, drowsily.

" Wake up," he said, " and turn over. You're talking in your sleep."

A week or so later Drouet strolled into Fitzgerald and  Moy's spruce in
dress and manner.

" Hello, Charley," said Hurstwood, looking out from  his office door.

Drouet strolled over and looked in upon the manger at his desk.

" When do you go out on the road again?" he inquired.

" Pretty soon," said Drouet.

" Haven't seen much of you this trip," said Hurstwood.

" Well, I've been busy," said Drouet.

They talked some few minutes on general topics.

" Say," said Drouet, as if stuck by a sudden idea, " I want you to come
out some evening."

" Out where?" inquired Hurstwood.

" Out to my house, of course," said Drouet smiling.

Hurstwood looked up quizzically, the least suggestion of a smile
hovering about his lips. He studied the face of Drouet in his wise way,
and then with the demeanor of a gentlemen, said: " Certainly; glad to."

" We'll have a nice game of euchre."

" May I bring a nice little bottle of Sec?" asked Hurstwood.

" Certainly," said Drouet. " I'll introduce you."


Chapter X
THE COUNSEL OF WINTER: FORTUNE'S AMBASSADOR CALLS

 In the light of the world's attitude toward woman and her duties, the
nature of Carrie's mental state deserves consideration. Actions such as
hers are measured by an  arbitrary scale. Society possesses a
conventional standard whereby it judges all things. All men should be
good, all women virtuous. Wherefore, villain, hast thou failed?

For all the liberal analysis of Spencer and our modern naturalistic
philosophers, we have but an infantile perception of morals. There is
more in the subject than mere conformity to a law of evolution. It is
yet deeper than conformity to things of earth alone. It is more
involved than we, as yet, perceive. Answer, first, why the heart
thrills; explain wherefore some plaintive note goes wandering about the
world, undying; make clear the rose's  stable alchemy evolving its
ruddy lamp in light and rain. In the essence of these facts lie the
first principles of morals.

" Oh," though Drouet, " how delicious is my conquest."

" Ah," though Carrie, with mournful misgivings, " what is it I have
lost?"

Before this world-old proposition we stand, serious, interested,
confused; endeavoring to evolve the true theory of morals-the true
answer to what is right.

In the view of a certain stratum of society, Carrie was comfortably
established-in eyes of the traveling, beaten by every wind and gusty
sheet of rain, she was safe in a halcyon harbor. Drouet had taken three
rooms, furnished, in Ogden Place, facing Union Park, on the West Side.
That was a little, green-carpeted breathing spot than which, to-day,
there is nothing more beautiful in Chicago. It afforded a vista
pleasant to contemplate. The best room looked out upon the lawn of the
park, now sear and brown, where a little lake lay sheltered. Over the
bare limbs of the trees, which now swayed in the wintry wind, rose the
steeple of the Union park Congregational Church, and far off the towers
of several others.

The rooms were comfortably enough furnished. There was good Brussels
carpet on the floor, rich in dull red and lemon shades, and
representing large jardiniÐ¸res filled with gorgeous, impossible
flowers. There was a large  pier-glass mirror between the two windows.
A large, soft, green, plush-covered couch occupied one corner, and
several rocking-chairs were set about. Some pictures, several rugs, a
few small pieces of bric-a-brac, and the tale of contents is told.

In the bedroom, off the front room, was Carrie's trunk, bought by
Drouet, and in the wardrobe built into the wall quite an array of
clothing-more than she had ever possessed before, and of very becoming
designs. There was a third room for possible use as a kitchen, where
Drouet had Carrie establish a little portable gas stove for the
preparation of small lunches, oysters, Welsh rarebits, and the like, of
which he was exceedingly fond; and, lastly a bath. The whole place was
cozy, in that it was lighted by gas and heated by furnace registers,
possessing also a small grate, set with an asbestos back, a method of
cheerful warming which was then first coming into use. By  her industry
and natural love of order, which now developed, the place maintained an
air pleasing in the extreme.

Here, then, was Carrie, established in a pleasant fashion, free of
certain difficulties which most ominously confronted her, laden with
many new ones which were of a mental order, and altogether so turned
about in all  of her earthly relationships that she might well have
been a new and different individual. She looked into her glass and saw
a prettier Carrie than she had seen before; she looked into her mind, a
mirror prepared of her own and the world's opinions, and saw a worse.
Between these two images she wavered, hesitating which to  believe.

" My, but you're a little beauty," Drouet was went to exclaim to her.

She would look at him with large, pleased eyes.

" You know it, don't you?" he would continue.

" Oh, I don't know," she would reply, feeling delight in the fact that
one should think so, hesitating to believe, though she really did, that
she was vain enough to think  so much of herself.

Her conscience, however, was not a Drouet, interested to praise. There
she heard a different voice, with which she argued, pleaded, excused.
It was no just and sapient counselor, in its last analysis. It was only
an average little conscience, habit, convention, in a confused way.
With it, the voice of the people was truly the voice of God

" Oh, thou failure!" said the voice.

" Why?" she questioned.

" Look at those about," came the whispered answer. " Look at those who
are good. How would they scorn to do what you have done. Look at the
good girls; how will they draw away from such as you when they know you
have been weak. You had not tried before you failed."

It was when Carrie was alone, looking out across the park, that she
would be listening to this. It would come infrequently-when something
else did not interface when the pleasant side was not too apparent,
when Drouet was not there. It was somewhat clear in utterance at first,
but never wholly convincing. There was always an answer, always the
December days threatened. She was alone; she was desireful; she was
fearful of the whistling wind. The voice of what made answer for her.

Once the bright days of summer pass by, a city takes on that somber
garb of gray, wrapped in which it goes about its labors during the long
winter. Its endless buildings look gray, its sky and its street assume
a somber hue; the scattered, leafless trees and wind-blown dust and
paper but add to the general solemnity of color. There seems to be
something in the chill breezes which scurry through the long, narrow
thoroughfares productive of rueful thoughts. Not poets alone, nor
artist, nor that superior order of mind which arrogates to itself all
refinement, feel this, but dogs and all men. These feels as much as the
poet, though they have not the same power of expression. The sparrow
upon the wire, the cat in the doorway, the dry horse tugging his weary
load, feel the long, keen breaths of winter. It strikes to the heart of
all life, animate and inanimate. If it were not for the artificial
fires of merriment, the rush of profit-seeking trade, and pleasure-
selling amusements; if the various merchants failed to make the
customary display within and without their establishments; if our
streets were not strung with signs of gorgeous hues and thronged with
hurrying purchasers, we would quickly discover how firmly the chill
hand of winter lays upon the heart; how dispiriting are the days during
which the sun withholds a portion of our allowance of light and warmth.
We are more dependent upon these things than is often thought. We are
insects produced by heat, and pass without it.

In the drag of such a gray day the secret voice would reassert itself,
feebly and more feebly.

Such mental conflict was not always uppermost. Carrie was not by any
means a gloomy soul. More, she had not the mind to get firm hold a
definite truth. When she could not find her way out of the labyrinth of
ill-logic which thought upon the subject created, she would tune away
entirely.

Drouet, all the time, was conducting himself in a model way for one of
his sort. he took her about a great deal spent money upon her, and when
he traveled took her with him. There were times when she would be alone
for two or three days, while he made the shorter circuits of his
business, but, as a rule, she saw a great deal of him.

" Say. Carrie," he said one morning, shortly  after they had so
established themselves, " I've invited my friend  Hurstwood to come out
some day and spend the evening  with us."

" Who is he?" asked Carrie, doubtfully.

" Oh, he's a mice man. He's manager of Fitzgerald and Moy's."

" What that?" said Carrie.

" The finest resort in town. It's a way-up, smell place."

Carrie puzzled a moment. She was wondering what Drouet had told him,
what her attitude would be.

" That's all right," said Drouet, feeling her thought.

" He doesn't know anything. You're Mrs. Drouet now."

There was something about this which struck Carrie as slightly
inconsiderate. She could see that Drouet did not have the keenest
sensibilities.

" Why don't we got married?" she inquired, thinking  of the voluble
promise he had made.

" Well, we will," he said, " just as soon as I get this  little deal of
mine closed up."

He was referring to some property which he said he had, and which
required so much attention, adjustment, and what not, that somehow or
other it interested with his free moral, personal actions.

" Just as soon as I get back from my Denver trip in January we'll do
it."

Carrie accepted this as basis for hope-it was a sort of salve to her
conscience, a pleasant way out. Under the  circumstances, things would
be righted. Her actions would be justified.

She really was not enamored of Drouet. She was more clever than he. In
a dim way, she was beginning to see where he lacked. If it had not been
for this, if she had not been able to measure and judge him a way, she
would have been utterly wretched in  her fear of not gaining his
affection, of losing his interest, of being swept away and left without
an anchorage. As it was, she wavered a little, slightly anxious, at
first, to gain him completely, but later feelings at ease in waiting.
She was not exactly sure what she thought of him-what she wanted to do.

When Hurstwood called, she met a man who was more clever than Drouet in
a hundred ways. He paid that  peculiar deference to women which every
member of the  sex appreciates. He was not overawed, he was not
overbold. His great charm was attentiveness. Schooled in winning those
birds of fine feather among his own sex, the merchants and
professionals who visited his resort, he could use even greater tact
when endeavoring to  prove agreeable to some one who charmed him. In a
pretty woman of any refinement of feeling whatsoever he found his
greatest incentive. His was mild, placid, assured, giving the
impression that he wished to be of  service only-to do something which
would make the  lady more pleased.

Drouet had ability in this fine himself when the game was worth the
candle, but he was too much the egotist to reach the polish which
Hurstwood possessed. He was too buoyant, too full of ruddy life, too
assured. He succeeded with many who were not quite schooled in the art
of love. He failed dismally where the woman was slightly experienced
and possessed innate refinement. In the case of Carrie he found a woman
who was all of the latter, but none of the former. He was lucky in the
fact that opportunity tumbled into his lap, as it were. A few years
later, with a little more experience, the slightest tide of success,
and he had not been able to approach Carrie at all.

" You ought to have a piano here, Drouet," said Hurstwood, smiling at
Carrie, on the evening in question, " so that your wife could play."

Drouet had not though of that.

" So we ought," he observed readily.

" Oh, I don't play," ventured Carrie.

" It's isn't very difficult," returned Hurstwood. " You could do very
well in a few weeks."

He was in the best form for entertaining this evening. His clothes were
particularly new and rich in appearance. The coat lapels stood out with
that medium tidiness which excellent cloth possesses. The vast was of a
rich Scotch plaid, set with a double row of round mother-of pearl
buttons. His cravat was shiny combination of nice threads, not loud,
not inconspicuous. What he wore did not strike the eye so forcibly as
that which. Drouet had on, but Carrie could see the elegance of the
material. Hurstwood's shoes were of soft, black calf, polished only to
a dull shine. Drouet wore patent leather, but Carrie could not help
feeling that there was a distinction in favor of the soft leather,
where all else was so rich. She noticed these things almost
unconsciously. They were things which would naturally flow from the
situation. She was used to Drouet's appearance.

" Suppose we have a little game of euchre?" He was  Hurstwood, after a
light round of conversation. He was rather dexterous in avoiding of
Carrie's past. He kept away from personalities altogether, and confined
himself to these things which did not concern individuals at all. By
his manner, he put Carrie at their ease, and by his deference and
pleasantries he amused her. He pretended to be seriously interested in
all she said.

" I don't know hoe to play," said Carrie.

" Charlie, you are neglecting a part of your duty," he observed to
Drouet most affably. " Between us, though," he went on, " we can show
you."

By this tact he made Drouet feel that he admired his choice. There was
something in his manner that showed that he was pleased to be there.
Drouet felt really closer to him than ever before. It gave him more
respect for Carrie. Her appearance came into a new light, under
Hurstwood's appreciation. The situation livened considerably.

" Now, let me see," said Hurstwood, looking over Carrie's shoulder very
deferentially. " What have you?" He studied for a moment. " That's
rather good," he said.

" You're lucky. Now, I'll show you how to trounce your husband. You
take my advice."

" Here," said Drouet, " if you two are going to scheme together, I
won't stand a ghost of a show. Hurstwood a regular sharp."

" No, it's your wife. She brings me luck. Why shouldn't she win?"

Carrie looked gratefully at Hurstwood, and smiled at Drouet. The former
took the air of a mere friend. He was simply there to enjoy himself.
Anything that Carrie did was pleasing to him, nothing more.

"There," he said, holding back one of his own good cards, and giving
Carrie a chance to take a trick. " I count that clever playing for a
beginner."

The latter laughed gleefully as she saw the hand coming her way. It was
as if she were invincible when Hurstwood helped her.

He did not look at her often. When he did, it was with a mild light in
his eye. Not a shade was there of anything save geniality and kindness.
He took back the  shifty, clever gleam, and replaced it with one of
innocence. Carrie could not guess but there it was pleasure with him in
the immediate kind. She felt that he considered she was doing a great
deal.

" It's unfair to let such playing go without earning something," he
said after a time, slipping his finger into  the little coin pocket of
his coat. " Let's play for dimes."

" All right," said Drouet, fishing for bills.

Hurstwood was quicker. His finger were full of new ten-cent pieces. "
Here we are," he said, supplying each one with a little stack.

" Oh, this gambling," smiled Carrie. " It's bad."

" No," said Drouet, " only fun. If you never play for more than that,
you will of to Heaven."

" Don't you moralize," said Hurstwood to Carrie gently, " until you see
what becomes of the money."

Drouet smiled.

" If your husband gets them, he'll tell you how bad  it is."

Drouet laughed loud.

There was such an ingratiating tone about Hurstwood's voice, the
insinuation was so perceptible that even Carrie got the humor of it.

" When do you leave?" said Hurstwood to Drouet.

" On Wednesday," he replied.

" It's rather hard to have your husband addressing Carrie like that,
isn't it?" said Hurstwood, addressing Carrie.

" She's going along with me this time," said Drouet.

" You must both go with me to the theater before you go."

" Certainly," said Drouet. " Eh, Carrie?"

" I'd like it ever so much," she replied.

Hurstwood did his best to see that Carrie won the  money. He rejoined
in her success, kept counting her winnings, and finally gathered and
put them in her extended hand. They spread a little lunch, at which he
served the wine, and afterwards he used fine tact in going

" Now," he said, addressing first Carrie and then. Drouet with his
eyes, " you must be ready at 7:30. I'll come and get you."

They went with him to the door and there was his cab waiting, its red
lamps gleaming cheerfully in the shadow.

" Now," he observed to Drouet, with a tone of good fellowship, " when
you leave your wife alone, you must let me show her around a little. It
will break up her loneliness."

" sure," said Drouet, quite pleased at the attention shown.

" You're so kind," observed Carrie.

" Not at all," said Hurstwood, " I would want you husband to do as much
for me."

 He smiled and went lightly away. Carrie was thoroughly impressed. She
had never come in contact with  such grace. As for Drouet, he was
equally pleased.

" There's a nice man," he remarked to Carrie, as the returned to their
cozy chamber. " A good friend of  mine, too."

" He seems to be," said Carrie.


Chapter XI
THE PERSUASION OF FASHION: FEELING GUARDS O'ER ITS OWN

 Carrie was an apt student of fortune's ways-of for Time's
superficialities. Seeing a thing, she would immediately set to
inquiring how she would look, properly rated to it. Be it known that
this is not fine feeling, it is Not wisdom. The greatest minds are not
so afflicted; and  On the contrary, the lowest order of mind is not so
disturbed. Fine clothes to her were a vast persuasion; they spoke
tenderly and Jesuitical for themselves. When she came within earshot of
their pleading, desire in her bent a willing ear. The voice of the so-
called inanimate! Who shall translate for us the language of the
stones?

" My dear," said the lace collar she secured from Partridge's, " I fit
you beautifully; don't give me up."

" Ah, such little feet," said the leather of the soft new  shoes; " how
effectively I cover them. What a pity they  Should ever want my aid."

Once these things were in hand, on her person. She might dream of
giving them up; the method by which  they came might intrude itself so
forcibly that she would ache to be rid of the thought of it, but she
would not give them up. " Put on the old clothes-that torn pair of
shoes," was called to her by her conscience in vain. She could possibly
have conquered the fear of hunger and gone back; the though of hard
work and a narrow round of suffering would, under the last pressure of
conscience have yielded, but spoil her appearance? -be old-clothes and
poor-appearing?-never!

Drouet heightened her opinion on this and allied subjects in such a
manner as to weaken her power of resisting their influence. It is so
easy to do this when the thing opined is in the line of what we desire.
In his hearty way, he insisted upon her good looks. He looked at her
admiringly, and she took it at its full value. Under the circumstances,
she did not need to carry herself as pretty women do. She picked that
knowledge up fast enough for herself. Drouet had a habit,
characteristic of his kind, of looking after stylishly dressed or
pretty women on the street and remarking upon them. He had just enough
of the feminine love of dress to be a good judge-not of intellect, but
of clothes. He saw how they set their little feet, how they carried
their chins, with what grace ands sinuosity they swung their bodies. A
dainty, self-conscious swaying of the hips by a woman was to  him as
alluring as the glint of red wine to a toper. He  would turn and follow
the disappearing vision with his eyes. he would thrill as a child with
the unhindered passion that was in him. He loves the thing that women
love in themselves, grace. At this their own shrine, he Knelt with
them, an ardent devotee.

" Did you see that women who went by just now?" he said to Carrie on
the first day they took a walk together. " Fine stepper, wasn't she?"

Carrie looked, and observed the grace commended.

" Yes, she is" she returned, cheerfully, a little suggestion of
possible defect in herself awakening in her mind. If that was so fine,
she must look at it more closely. Instinctively, she felt a desire to
imitate it. Surely she could do that too.

When one of her mind sees many things emphasized and reemphasized and
admired, she gathers the logic of it and applies accordingly. Drouet
was not shrewd enough to see that this was not tactful. He could not
see that it would be better to make her feel that she was competing
with herself, not others better than herself. He would not have done it
with an older, wiser woman, but in Carrie he saw only the novice. Less
clever than she, he was naturally unable to comprehend her sensibility.
He went on educating and wounding her, a thing rather foolish in one
whose admiration for his pupil and victim was apt to grow.

Carrie took the instructions affably. She saw what Drouet liked; in
vague way she saw where he was weak. It lessens a woman's opinion of a
man when she learns that  his admiration is so pointedly and generously
distributed. She sees but one object of supreme compliment in this
world, and that is herself. If a man is to succeed with  many women, he
went he must be all in all to each.

In her own apartments Carrie saw things that were lessons in the same
school.

In the same house with her live an official of one of the  Theatres,
Mr. Frank A. Hale, manager of the Standard, and his wife, a pleasing-
looking brunette of thirty-five. They were people of a sort very common
in America today, who live respectably from hand to mouth. Her wife,
quite attractive affected the feeling of youth, and objected to that
sort of home life which means the care of a house and the raising of a
family. Like Drouet and Carrie, they also occupied three rooms on the
floor above. Not long after she arrived Mrs. Hale established social
relations with her, and together they went about. For a long time this
was her only companionship, and the gossip of the manager's wife formed
the medium, through which  she saw the world. Such trivialities, such
praises of Wealth, such conventional expression of morals as sifted
through this passive creature's mind, fell upon Carrie and for the
while confused her.

On the other hand, her own feelings were a corrective  influence. Their
constant drag to something better was not to be denied. By those things
which address the  heart was she steadily recalled. In the apartments
across the hall were a young girl and her mother. They were from
Evansville, Indiana, the wife and daughter of a railroad treasurer. The
daughter was her to study music, the mother to keep her company.

Carrie did not make their acquaintance, but she saw the daughter coming
in and going out. A few times she had seen her a the piano in the
parlor, and not infrequently had heard her play. This young woman was
particularly dressy for her station, and wore a jeweled ring or two
which flashed upon her white fingers as she played.

Now Carrie was affected by music. her nervous composition responded to
certain strains, much as certain strings of a harp vibrate when a
corresponding key of a piano is struck. She was delicately molded in
sentiment and answered with vague ruminations to certain wistful
chords. They awoke longings for those things which  she did not have.
They caused her cling closer to  things she possessed. One shorts song
the young lady played in a most soulful and tender mood. Carrie heard
it through the open door from the parlor below, In was at that hour
between afternoon and night when, for the idle, the wanderer, things
are apt to take on a wistful aspect. The mind wanders forth on far
journeys and returns with sheaves of withered and departed joys. Carrie
sat at her window looking out. Drouet had been away since ten in the
morning. She had amused herself with a  walk, a book by Bertha M. Clay
which Drouet had let there, though she did not wholly enjoy the latter,
and by changing her dress for the evening. Now she sat looking out
across the park as wistful and depressed as the nature which craves
variety and life can be under such circumstances. As she contemplated
her new state, the strain  from the parlor below stole upward. Within
it her to the things which were best and saddest within the  small
limit of her experience. She became for the moment a repentant.

While she was in this mood Drouet came in, bringing  with him an
entirely different atmosphere. It was dusk and Carrie had neglected to
light the lamp. The fire in the grate, too, had burned low.

" Where are you, Cad?" he said, using a pet name he had given her.

" Here," she answered.

There was something delicate and lonely in her voice, but he could not
hear it. he had not the poetry in him that would seek a woman out under
such circumstances and console her for the tragedy of life. Instead, he
struck a match and lighted the gas.

" Hello," he exclaimed," you've been crying."

her eyes were still wet with a few vague tears.

" Pshaw," he said, " you don't want to do that."

He took her hand, feeling in his good-natured egotism that it was
probably lack of his presence which had made her lonely.

" Come on, now," he went on; " it's all right. Let's waltz a little to
that music."

He could not have introduced a more incongruous  proposition. It made
clear to Carrie that he could not sympathize with her. She could not
have framed thoughts which would have expressed his defect or make
clear the difference between them, but she felt it. It was his first
great mistake.

What Drouet said about the girl's grace, as she tripped Out evening
accompanied by her mother,  caused Carrie To perceive the nature and
value of those little moodish Ways which women adopt when they would
presume to be Something. She looked in the mirror and pursed up her
Lips, accomplishing it with a little toss of the head, as the Had seen
the railroad treasurer's daughter do. She caught  Up her skirts with an
easy swing, for had not, Drouet remarked that in her and several
others, and Carrie was  Naturally imitative. She began to get the hang
of those Little things which the pretty women who has vanity invariably
adopts. In shorts, her knowledge of grace  Doubled, and with her
appearance changed. She became  a girl of considerable taste.

Drouet noticed this. He saw the new bow in her hair  and the new way of
arraying her locks which she affected  one morning.

" You look fine that way, Cad," he said.

" Do I?" she replied, sweetly. It made her try for  other effects that
selfsame day.

She used her feet less heavily, a thing that was brought About by her
attempting to imitate the treasurer's daughter's graceful carriage. How
much influence the presence Of that young women in the same house had
upon her it Would be difficult to say. But, because of all these things
When Hurstwood called he had found a young women  Who was much more
than the Carrie to whom Drouet had  First spoken. The primary defects
of dress and manner Had passed. She was pretty, graceful, rich in the
timidity  Born of uncertainty, and with a something childlike in her
Large eyes which captured the fancy of this starched and  conventional
poser among men.  It was the ancient attraction of the fresh for the
stale. If there was a touch of  appreciation left in him for the bloom
and unsophistication which is the charm of youth, it rekindled now. He
looked into her pretty face and felt the subtle waves of young life
radiating therefrom. In that large clear eye he could see nothing that
his blasÐ¹ nature could understand as guile. The little vanity, if he
could have perceived it there, would have touched him as a pleasant
thing.

" I wonder," he said as he rode away in his cab, " how Drouet came to
win her."  	He gave her credit for feelings superior to Drouet at  The
first glance.

The cab plopped ailing along between the far-receding lines of  gas
lamps on either hand. He folded his gloved hands  and saw only the
lighted chamber and Carrie's face. He  was pondering over the delight
of youthful beauty.

" I'll have a bouquet for her," he though. " Drouet won't mind."

He never for a moment concealed the fact of her attraction for himself.
He troubled himself not at all about  Drouet's priority. He was merely
floating those gossamer threads of thought which, like the spider's he
Hoped would lay hold somewhere. He did not know, he could not guess,
what the result would be.

A few weeks later Drouet, in his peregrinations, encountered one of his
well-dressed lady acquaintances in  Chicago on his return from a short
trip to Omaha. He Had intended to hurry out to Ogden Place and surprise
Carrie, but now he fell into an interesting conversation And soon
modified his original intention.

" Let's go to dinner," he said, little reckoning any chance meeting
which might trouble his way.

" Certainty," said his companion.

They visited one of  the better restaurants for a social  Chat. It was
five in the afternoon when they met; it was  Seven thirty before the
last bone was picked.

Drouet was just finishing a little incident he was relating, and his
face was expanding into a smile, when Hurstwood's eye caught his own.
The latter had come in  with  several friends, and, seeing Drouet and
some woman, not Carrie, drew his own conclusion.

" Ah, the rascal," he though, and then, with a touch of  righteous
sympathy, " that's pretty hard on the little girl."

Drouet jumped from one easy though to another as  he caught Hurstwood's
eye. He felt but every little misgiving, until he saw that Hurstwood
was cautiously pretending not to see. Then some of the latter's
impression forced itself upon him. He though of Carrie and their  last
meeting. By George, he would have to explain this to Hurstwood. Such a
chance half-hour with an old friend  must not have anything more
attached to it really warranted.

For the first time he was troubled. Here was a moral Complication of
which he could not possibly get the ends. Hurstwood would laugh at him
for being a fickle boy. He would laugh with Hurstwood. Carrie would
never Hear, his present companion at table would never know And yet he
could not help feeling that he was getting the was not guilty. He broke
up the dinner by becoming  dull, and saw his companion on her car. Then
he went home.

" He hasn't talked to me about any of these later flames," though
Hurstwood to himself. " He thinks he cares for the girl out there."

He ought not to think I'm knocking around, since Have just introduced
him out there," though Drouet.

" I saw you," Hurstwood said, genially, the next time. Drouet drifted
in to his polished resort, from which he  Could not stay away. He
raised his forefinger indicatively,  as parents do to children.

" An old acquaintance of mine that I ran into just as  was coming up
from the station," explained Drouet.

" She used to be quite a beauty."

" Still attracts a little, eh?" returned the other, affecting to jest.

" Oh, no," said Drouet, " just couldn't escape her this time."

" How long are you here?" asked Hurstwood.

" Only a few days."

" You must bring the girls down and take dinner with  me," he said. "
I'm afraid you keep her cooped up out  there. I'll get a box for Joe
Jefferson."

" Not me," answered the drummer. " Sure I'll come."

This pleased Hurstwood immensely. He gave Drouet no credit for any
feelings toward Carrie whatever. He  Envied him, and now, as he looked
at the well-dressed salesman, whom he so much liked, the gleam of the
Rival glowed in his eye. He began to " size up" Drouet From the
standpoints of wit and fascination. He began to  Look to see where he
was weak. There was no disputing that, whatever he might think of him
as a good fellow, he felt a certain amount of contempt for him as a
lover. He could hoodwink him all right. Why, if he would just Let
Carrie see one such little incident as that of Thursday, it would
settle the matter. He ran on it thought, almost exulting, the while he
laughed and chatted, and Drouet felt nothing. He had no power of
analyzing the glance and the atmosphere of a man like Hurstwood. He
stood and smiled and accepted the invitation while his friend examined
him with the eye of a hawk.

The object of this peculiarly involved comedy was not  Thinking of
either. She was busy adjusting her thoughts And feelings to newer
conditions, and was not in danger  of suffering disturbing pangs from
either quarter.

One evening Drouet found her dressing herself before That glass.

" Cad," said he, catching her, " I believe you're getting  vain."

" Nothing of the kind," she returned, smiling.

" Well, you're mighty pretty," he went on, slipping his arm around her.
" Put on that navy-blue dress of yours and I'll take you to the show."

" Oh, I've promised Mrs. Hale to go with her to the  Exposition to-
night," she returned, apologetically.

" You did, eh? He said, studying the situation abstractedly. " I
wouldn't care to go to that myself."

" Well, I don't know," answered Carrie, puzzling, but not offering to
break her promise in his favor.

Just then a knock came at their door and the maidservant handed a
letter in.

" He says there's an answer expected," she explained.

" It's from Hurstwood, " said Drouet, noting the superscription as he
tore it open.

" You are to come down and see Joe Jefferson with me to-night," it ran
it part. " It's my turn, as we agreed the  other day. All other bets
are off."  	" Well, what do you say to this?" asked Drouet, innocently,
while Carrie's mind bubbled with favorable  replies.

" You had better decided, Charlie," she said, reservedly.

" I guess we had better go, if you can break that engagement upstairs,"
said Drouet.

" Oh, I can," returned Carrie without thinking.

Drouet selected writing paper while Carrie went to  change her dress.
She hardly explained to herself why this latest invitation appealed to
her most.

" Shall I wear my hair as I did yesterday?" she asked , as she came out
with several articles of apparel pending.

" Sure," he returned, pleasantly.

She was relieved to see that he felt nothing. She did  Not credit her
willingness to go to any fascination Hurstwood Held for her. It seemed
that that combination of Hurstwood, Drouet, and herself was more
agreeable Than anything else that had been suggested. She arrayed
Herself most carefully and they started off, extending  Excuses
upstairs.

" I say." Said Hurstwood as, they came up the theatre lobby, " we are
exceeding charming this evening." Carrie fluttered under his approving
glance.

" Now, then," he said, leading the way up the foyer into the theater.

If ever there was dressiness it was here. It was the personification of
the old term spick and span.

" Did you ever see Jefferson?" he questioned, as he leaned toward
Carrie in the box.

" I never did," she returned.

" He's delightful, delightful," he went on giving the  commonplace
rendition of approval which such men know. He sent Drouet after a
program, and then discoursed to Carrie concerning Jefferson as he had
heard of him. The former was pleased beyond expression, and  was really
hypnotized by the environment, the trappings of the box, the elegance
of her companion. Several times their eyes accidentally met, and then
there poured into hers such a flood of feeling as she had never before
experienced. She could not for the moment explain it, for in  the next
glance or the next move of the hand there was seeming indifference,
mingled only with the kindest attention.

Drouet shared in the conversation, but he was almost Dull in
comparison. Hurstwood entertained them both,  and now it was driven
into Carrie's mind that here was the  superior man. She instinctively
felt that he was stronger and higher, and yet with a so simple. By the
end of the  third act she was sure that Drouet was only a kindly soul,
but otherwise defective. He sank every moment in her  estimation by the
strong comparison.

" I have had such a nice time," said Carrie, when it was all over and
they were coming out.

" Yes, indeed," added Drouet, who was not in the least aware that a
battle had been fought and his defenses weakened. He was like the
Emperor of China, who sat  glorying in himself, unaware that his
fairest provinces were being wrested from him.

" Well, you have saved me a dreary evening," returned Hurstwood. "
Good-night."

He took Carrie's little hand, and a current of feeling Swept from one
to the other.

" I'm so tried," said Carrie, leaning back in the car when Drouet began
to talk.

" Well, you rest a little while I smoke," he said, rising and then he
foolishly went to the forward platform of the  Car and left the game as
it stood


Chapter XII

OF THE LAMPS OF THE MANSIONS--THE AMBASSADOR PLEA

 Mrs. Hurstwood was not aware of any of her husband's moral defections,
though she might readily have suspected his tendencies, which she well
understood.  She was a woman upon whose action under provocation you
could never count.  Hurstwood, for one, had not the slightest idea of
what she would do under certain circumstances.  He had never seen her
thoroughly aroused. In fact, she was not a woman who would fly into a
passion.  She had too little faith in mankind not to know that they
were erring.  She was too calculating to jeopardize any advantage she
might gain in the way of information by fruitless clamor.  Her wrath
would never wreak itself in one fell blow.  She would wait and brood,
studying the details and adding to them until her power might be
commensurate with her desire for revenge.  At the same time, she would
not delay to inflict any injury, big or little, which would wound the
object of her revenge and still leave him uncertain as to the source of
the evil.  She was a cold, self-centered woman, with many a thought of
her own which never found expression, not even by so much as the glint
of an eye.

Hurstwood felt some of this in her nature, though he did not actually
perceive it.  He dwelt with her in peace and some satisfaction.  He did
not fear her in the least--there was no cause for it.  She still took a
faint pride in him, which was augmented by her desire to have her
social integrity maintained. She was secretly somewhat pleased by the
fact that much of her husband's property was in her name, a precaution
which Hurstwood had taken when his home interests were somewhat more
alluring than at present.  His wife had not the slightest reason to
feel that anything would ever go amiss with their household, and yet
the shadows which run before gave her a thought of the good of it now
and then.  She was in a position to become refractory with considerable
advantage, and Hurstwood conducted himself circumspectly because he
felt that he could not be sure of anything once she became
dissatisfied.

It so happened that on the night when Hurstwood, Carrie, and Drouet
were in the box at McVickar's, George, Jr., was in the sixth row of the
parquet with the daughter of H. B. Carmichael, the third partner of a
wholesale dry-goods house of that city. Hurstwood did not see his son,
for he sat, as was his wont, as far back as possible, leaving himself
just partially visible, when he bent forward, to those within the first
six rows in question.  It was his wont to sit this way in every
theatre--to make his personality as inconspicuous as possible where it
would be no advantage to him to have it otherwise.

He never moved but what, if there was any danger of his conduct being
misconstrued or ill-reported, he looked carefully about him and counted
the cost of every inch of conspicuity.

The next morning at breakfast his son said:

"I saw you, Governor, last night."

"Were you at McVickar's?" said Hurstwood, with the best grace in the
world.

"Yes," said young George.

"Who with?"

"Miss Carmichael."

Mrs. Hurstwood directed an inquiring glance at her husband, but could
not judge from his appearance whether it was any more than a casual
look into the theatre which was referred to.

"How was the play?" she inquired.

"Very good," returned Hurstwood, "only it's the same old thing, 'Rip
Van Winkle.'"

"Whom did you go with?" queried his wife, with assumed indifference.

"Charlie Drouet and his wife.  They are friends of Moy's, visiting
here."

Owing to the peculiar nature of his position, such a disclosure as this
would ordinarily create no difficulty.  His wife took it for granted
that his situation called for certain social movements in which she
might not be included.  But of late he had pleaded office duty on
several occasions when his wife asked for his company to any evening
entertainment.  He had done so in regard to the very evening in
question only the morning before.

"I thought you were going to be busy," she remarked, very carefully.

"So I was," he exclaimed.  "I couldn't help the interruption, but I
made up for it afterward by working until two."

This settled the discussion for the time being, but there was a residue
of opinion which was not satisfactory.  There was no time at which the
claims of his wife could have been more unsatisfactorily pushed.  For
years he had been steadily modifying his matrimonial devotion, and
found her company dull. Now that a new light shone upon the horizon,
this older luminary paled in the west.  He was satisfied to turn his
face away entirely, and any call to look back was irksome.

She, on the contrary, was not at all inclined to accept anything less
than a complete fulfillment of the letter of their relationship, though
the spirit might be wanting.

"We are coming down town this afternoon," she remarked, a few days
later.  "I want you to come over to Kinsley's and meet Mr. Phillips and
his wife.  They're stopping at the Tremont, and we're going to show
them around a little."

After the occurrence of Wednesday, he could not refuse, though the
Phillips were about as uninteresting as vanity and ignorance could make
them.  He agreed, but it was with short grace.  He was angry when he
left the house.

"I'll put a stop to this," he thought.  "I'm not going to be bothered
fooling around with visitors when I have work to do."

Not long after this Mrs. Hurstwood came with a similar proposition,
only it was to a matinee this time.

"My dear," he returned, "I haven't time.  I'm too busy."

"You find time to go with other people, though," she replied, with
considerable irritation.

"Nothing of the kind," he answered.  "I can't avoid business relations,
and that's all there is to it."

"Well, never mind," she exclaimed.  Her lips tightened.  The feeling of
mutual antagonism was increased.

On the other hand, his interest in Drouet's little shop-girl grew in an
almost evenly balanced proportion.  That young lady, under the stress
of her situation and the tutelage of her new friend, changed
effectively.  She had the aptitude of the struggler who seeks
emancipation.  The glow of a more showy life was not lost upon her.
She did not grow in knowledge so much as she awakened in the matter of
desire.  Mrs. Hale's extended harangues upon the subjects of wealth and
position taught her to distinguish between degrees of wealth. Mrs. Hale
loved to drive in the afternoon in the sun when it was fine, and to
satisfy her soul with a sight of those mansions and lawns which she
could not afford.  On the North Side had been erected a number of
elegant mansions along what is now known as the North Shore Drive.  The
present lake wall of stone and granite was not then in place, but the
road had been well laid out, the intermediate spaces of lawn were
lovely to look upon, and the houses were thoroughly new and imposing.
When the winter season had passed and the first fine days of the early
spring appeared, Mrs. Hale secured a buggy for an afternoon and invited
Carrie.  They rode first through Lincoln Park and on far out towards
Evanston, turning back at four and arriving at the north end of the
Shore Drive at about five o'clock.  At this time of year the days are
still comparatively short, and the shadows of the evening were
beginning to settle down upon the great city. Lamps were beginning to
burn with that mellow radiance which seems almost watery and
translucent to the eye.  There was a softness in the air which speaks
with an infinite delicacy of feeling to the flesh as well as to the
soul.  Carrie felt that it was a lovely day.  She was ripened by it in
spirit for many suggestions.  As they drove along the smooth pavement
an occasional carriage passed.  She saw one stop and the footman
dismount, opening the door for a gentleman who seemed to be leisurely
returning from some afternoon pleasure.  Across the broad lawns, now
first freshening into green, she saw lamps faintly glowing upon rich
interiors.  Now it was but a chair, now a table, now an ornate corner,
which met her eye, but it appealed to her as almost nothing else could.
Such childish fancies as she had had of fairy palaces and kingly
quarters now came back. She imagined that across these richly carved
entrance-ways, where the globed and crystalled lamps shone upon paneled
doors set with stained and designed panes of glass, was neither care
nor unsatisfied desire.  She was perfectly certain that here was
happiness.  If she could but stroll up yon broad walk, cross that rich
entrance-way, which to her was of the beauty of a jewel, and sweep in
grace and luxury to possession and command--oh! how quickly would
sadness flee; how, in an instant, would the heartache end.  She gazed
and gazed, wondering, delighting, longing, and all the while the siren
voice of the unrestful was whispering in her ear.

"If we could have such a home as that," said Mrs. Hale sadly, "how
delightful it would be."

"And yet they do say," said Carrie, "that no one is ever happy."

She had heard so much of the canting philosophy of the grapeless fox.

"I notice," said Mrs. Hale, "that they all try mighty hard, though, to
take their misery in a mansion."

When she came to her own rooms, Carrie saw their comparative
insignificance.  She was not so dull but that she could perceive they
were but three small rooms in a moderately well-furnished boarding-
house.  She was not contrasting it now with what she had had, but what
she had so recently seen.  The glow of the palatial doors was still in
her eye, the roll of cushioned carriages still in her ears.  What,
after all, was Drouet?  What was she?  At her window, she thought it
over, rocking to and fro, and gazing out across the lamp-lit park
toward the lamp-lit houses on Warren and Ashland avenues.  She was too
wrought up to care to go down to eat, too pensive to do aught but rock
and sing.  Some old tunes crept to her lips, and, as she sang them, her
heart sank.  She longed and longed and longed.  It was now for the old
cottage room in Columbia City, now the mansion upon the Shore Drive,
now the fine dress of some lady, now the elegance of some scene.  She
was sad beyond measure, and yet uncertain, wishing, fancying. Finally,
it seemed as if all her state was one of loneliness and forsakenness,
and she could scarce refrain from trembling at the lip.  She hummed and
hummed as the moments went by, sitting in the shadow by the window, and
was therein as happy, though she did not perceive it, as she ever would
be.

While Carrie was still in this frame of mind, the house-servant brought
up the intelligence that Mr. Hurstwood was in the parlor asking to see
Mr. and Mrs. Drouet.

"I guess he doesn't know that Charlie is out of town," thought Carrie.

She had seen comparatively little of the manager during the winter, but
had been kept constantly in mind of him by one thing and another,
principally by the strong impression he had made. She was quite
disturbed for the moment as to her appearance, but soon satisfied
herself by the aid of the mirror, and went below.

Hurstwood was in his best form, as usual.  He hadn't heard that Drouet
was out of town.  He was but slightly affected by the intelligence, and
devoted himself to the more general topics which would interest Carrie.
It was surprising--the ease with which he conducted a conversation.  He
was like every man who has had the advantage of practice and knows he
has sympathy.  He knew that Carrie listened to him pleasurably, and,
without the least effort, he fell into a train of observation which
absorbed her fancy.  He drew up his chair and modulated his voice to
such a degree that what he said seemed wholly confidential.  He
confined himself almost exclusively to his observation of men and
pleasures.  He had been here and there, he had seen this and that.
Somehow he made Carrie wish to see similar things, and all the while
kept her aware of himself.  She could not shut out the consciousness of
his individuality and presence for a moment.  He would raise his eyes
slowly in smiling emphasis of something, and she was fixed by their
magnetism.  He would draw out, with the easiest grace, her approval.
Once he touched her hand for emphasis and she only smiled.  He seemed
to radiate an atmosphere which suffused her being.  He was never dull
for a minute, and seemed to make her clever.  At least, she brightened
under his influence until all her best side was exhibited.  She felt
that she was more clever with him than with others.  At least, he
seemed to find so much in her to applaud.  There was not the slightest
touch of patronage.  Drouet was full of it.

There had been something so personal, so subtle, in each meeting
between them, both when Drouet was present and when he was absent, that
Carrie could not speak of it without feeling a sense of difficulty.
She was no talker.  She could never arrange her thoughts in fluent
order.  It was always a matter of feeling with her, strong and deep.
Each time there had been no sentence of importance which she could
relate, and as for the glances and sensations, what woman would reveal
them? Such things had never been between her and Drouet.  As a matter
of fact, they could never be.  She had been dominated by distress and
the enthusiastic forces of relief which Drouet represented at an
opportune moment when she yielded to him.  Now she was persuaded by
secret current feelings which Drouet had never understood. Hurstwood's
glance was as effective as the spoken words of a lover, and more.  They
called for no immediate decision, and could not be answered.

People in general attach too much importance to words.  They are under
the illusion that talking effects great results.  As a matter of fact,
words are, as a rule, the shallowest portion of all the argument.  They
but dimly represent the great surging feelings and desires which lie
behind.  When the distraction of the tongue is removed, the heart
listens.

In this conversation she heard, instead of his words, the voices of the
things which he represented.  How suave was the counsel of his
appearance!  How feelingly did his superior state speak for itself!
The growing desire he felt for her lay upon her spirit as a gentle
hand.  She did not need to tremble at all, because it was invisible;
she did not need to worry over what other people would say--what she
herself would say--because it had no tangibility.  She was being
pleaded with, persuaded, led into denying old rights and assuming new
ones, and yet there were no words to prove it.  Such conversation as
was indulged in held the same relationship to the actual mental
enactments of the twain that the low music of the orchestra does to the
dramatic incident which it is used to cover.

"Have you ever seen the houses along the Lake Shore on the North Side?"
asked Hurstwood.

"Why, I was just over there this afternoon--Mrs. Hale and I. Aren't
they beautiful?"

"They're very fine," he answered.

"Oh, me," said Carrie, pensively.  "I wish I could live in such a
place."

"You're not happy," said Hurstwood, slowly, after a slight pause.

He had raised his eyes solemnly and was looking into her own.  He
assumed that he had struck a deep chord.  Now was a slight chance to
say a word in his own behalf.  He leaned over quietly and continued his
steady gaze.  He felt the critical character of the period.  She
endeavored to stir, but it was useless.  The whole strength of a man's
nature was working.  He had good cause to urge him on.  He looked and
looked, and the longer the situation lasted the more difficult it
became.  The little shop-girl was getting into deep water.  She was
letting her few supports float away from her.

"Oh," she said at last, "you mustn't look at me like that."

"I can't help it," he answered.

She relaxed a little and let the situation endure, giving him strength.

"You are not satisfied with life, are you?"

"No," she answered, weakly.

He saw he was the master of the situation--he felt it.  He reached over
and touched her hand.

"You mustn't," she exclaimed, jumping up.

"I didn't intend to," he answered, easily.

She did not run away, as she might have done.  She did not terminate
the interview, but he drifted off into a pleasant field of thought with
the readiest grace.  Not long after he rose to go, and she felt that he
was in power. "You mustn't feel bad," he said, kindly; "things will
straighten out in the course of time."

She made no answer, because she could think of nothing to say.

"We are good friends, aren't we?" he said, extending his hand.

"Yes," she answered.

"Not a word, then, until I see you again."

He retained a hold on her hand.

"I can't promise," she said, doubtfully.

"You must be more generous than that," he said, in such a simple way
that she was touched.

"Let's not talk about it any more," she returned.

"All right," he said, brightening.

He went down the steps and into his cab.  Carrie closed the door and
ascended into her room.  She undid her broad lace collar before the
mirror and unfastened her pretty alligator belt which she had recently
bought.

"I'm getting terrible," she said, honestly affected by a feeling of
trouble and shame.  "I don't seem to do anything right."

She unloosed her hair after a time, and let it hang in loose brown
waves.  Her mind was going over the events of the evening.

"I don't know," she murmured at last, "what I can do."

"Well," said Hurstwood as he rode away, "she likes me all right; that I
know."

The aroused manager whistled merrily for a good four miles to t his
office an old melody that he had not recalled for fifteen years.


Chapter XIII
HIS CREDENTIALS ACCEPTED--A BABEL OF TONGUES

 It was not quite two days after the scene between Carrie and Hurstwood
in the Ogden Place parlor before he again put in his appearance.  He
had been thinking almost uninterruptedly of her. Her leniency had, in a
way, inflamed his regard.  He felt that he must succeed with her, and
that speedily.

The reason for his interest, not to say fascination, was deeper than
mere desire.  It was a flowering out of feelings which had been
withering in dry and almost barren soil for many years.  It is probable
that Carrie represented a better order of woman than had ever attracted
him before.  He had had no love affair since that which culminated in
his marriage, and since then time and the world had taught him how raw
and erroneous was his original judgment.  Whenever he thought of it, he
told himself that, if he had it to do over again, he would never marry
such a woman.  At the same time, his experience with women in general
had lessened his respect for the sex.  He maintained a cynical
attitude, well grounded on numerous experiences.  Such women as he had
known were of nearly one type, selfish, ignorant, flashy.  The wives of
his friends were not inspiring to look upon.  His own wife had
developed a cold, commonplace nature which to him was anything but
pleasing.  What he knew of that under-world where grovel the beat-men
of society (and he knew a great deal) had hardened his nature.  He
looked upon most women with suspicion--a single eye to the utility of
beauty and dress.  He followed them with a keen, suggestive glance.  At
the same time, he was not so dull but that a good woman commanded his
respect.  Personally, he did not attempt to analyze the marvel of a
saintly woman.  He would take off his hat, and would silence the light-
tongued and the vicious in her presence--much as the Irish keeper of a
Bowery hall will humble himself before a Sister of Mercy, and pay toll
to charity with a willing and reverent hand.  But he would not think
much upon the question of why he did so.

A man in his situation who comes, after a long round of worthless or
hardening experiences, upon a young, unsophisticated, innocent soul, is
apt either to hold aloof, out of a sense of his own remoteness, or to
draw near and become fascinated and elated by his discovery.  It is
only by a roundabout process that such men ever do draw near such a
girl.  They have no method, no understanding of how to ingratiate
themselves in youthful favor, save when they find virtue in the toils.
If, unfortunately, the fly has got caught in the net, the spider can
come forth and talk business upon its own terms.  So when maidenhood
has wandered into the moil of the city, when it is brought within the
circle of the "rounder" and the roue, even though it be at the
outermost rim, they can come forth and use their alluring arts.

Hurstwood had gone, at Drouet's invitation, to meet a new baggage of
fine clothes and pretty features.  He entered, expecting to indulge in
an evening of lightsome frolic, and then lose track of the newcomer
forever.  Instead he found a woman whose youth and beauty attracted
him.  In the mild light of Carrie's eye was nothing of the calculation
of the mistress.  In the diffident manner was nothing of the art of the
courtesan.  He saw at once that a mistake had been made, that some
difficult conditions had pushed this troubled creature into his
presence, and his interest was enlisted.  Here sympathy sprang to the
rescue, but it was not unmixed with selfishness.  He wanted to win
Carrie because he thought her fate mingled with his was better than if
it were united with Drouet's.  He envied the drummer his conquest as he
had never envied any man in all the course of his experience.

Carrie was certainly better than this man, as she was superior,
mentally, to Drouet.  She came fresh from the air of the village, the
light of the country still in her eye.  Here was neither guile nor
rapacity.  There were slight inherited traits of both in her, but they
were rudimentary.  She was too full of wonder and desire to be greedy.
She still looked about her upon the great maze of the city without
understanding.  Hurstwood felt the bloom and the youth.  He picked her
as he would the fresh fruit of a tree.  He felt as fresh in her
presence as one who is taken out of the flash of summer to the first
cool breath of spring.

Carrie, left alone since the scene in question, and having no one with
whom to counsel, had at first wandered from one strange mental
conclusion to another, until at last, tired out, she gave it up.  She
owed something to Drouet, she thought.  It did not seem more than
yesterday that he had aided her when she was worried and distressed.
She had the kindliest feelings for him in every way.  She gave him
credit for his good looks, his generous feelings, and even, in fact,
failed to recollect his egotism when he was absent; but she could not
feel any binding influence keeping her for him as against all others.
In fact, such a thought had never had any grounding, even in Drouet's
desires.

The truth is, that this goodly drummer carried the doom of all enduring
relationships in his own lightsome manner and unstable fancy.  He went
merrily on, assured that he was alluring all, that affection followed
tenderly in his wake, that things would endure unchangingly for his
pleasure.  When he missed some old face, or found some door finally
shut to him, it did not grieve him deeply.  He was too young, too
successful.  He would remain thus young in spirit until he was dead.

As for Hurstwood, he was alive with thoughts and feelings concerning
Carrie.  He had no definite plans regarding her, but he was determined
to make her confess an affection for him.  He thought he saw in her
drooping eye, her unstable glance, her wavering manner, the symptoms of
a budding passion.  He wanted to stand near her and make her lay her
hand in his--he wanted to find out what her next step would be--what
the next sign of feeling for him would be.  Such anxiety and enthusiasm
had not affected him for years.  He was a youth again in feeling--a
cavalier in action.

In his position opportunity for taking his evenings out was excellent.
He was a most faithful worker in general, and a man who commanded the
confidence of his employers in so far as the distribution of his time
was concerned.  He could take such hours off as he chose, for it was
well known that he fulfilled his managerial duties successfully,
whatever time he might take.  His grace, tact, and ornate appearance
gave the place an air which was most essential, while at the same time
his long experience made him a most excellent judge of its stock
necessities. Bartenders and assistants might come and go, singly or in
groups, but, so long as he was present, the host of old-time customers
would barely notice the change.  He gave the place the atmosphere to
which they were used.  Consequently, he arranged his hours very much to
suit himself, taking now an afternoon, now an evening, but invariably
returning between eleven and twelve to witness the last hour or two of
the day's business and look after the closing details.

"You see that things are safe and all the employees are out when you go
home, George," Moy had once remarked to him, and he never once, in all
the period of his long service, neglected to do this.  Neither of the
owners had for years been in the resort after five in the afternoon,
and yet their manager as faithfully fulfilled this request as if they
had been there regularly to observe.

On this Friday afternoon, scarcely two days after his previous visit,
he made up his mind to see Carrie.  He could not stay away longer.

"Evans," he said, addressing the head barkeeper, "if any one calls, I
will be back between four and five."

He hurried to Madison Street and boarded a horse-car, which carried him
to Ogden Place in half an hour.

Carrie had thought of going for a walk, and had put on a light gray
woolen dress with a jaunty double-breasted jacket.  She had out her hat
and gloves, and was fastening a white lace tie about her throat when
the housemaid brought up the information that Mr. Hurstwood wished to
see her.

She started slightly at the announcement, but told the girl to say that
she would come down in a moment, and proceeded to hasten her dressing.

Carrie could not have told herself at this moment whether she was glad
or sorry that the impressive manager was awaiting her presence.  She
was slightly flurried and tingling in the cheeks, but it was more
nervousness than either fear or favor.  She did not try to conjecture
what the drift of the conversation would be.  She only felt that she
must be careful, and that Hurstwood had an indefinable fascination for
her.  Then she gave her tie its last touch with her fingers and went
below.

The deep-feeling manager was himself a little strained in the nerves by
the thorough consciousness of his mission.  He felt that he must make a
strong play on this occasion, but now that the hour was come, and he
heard Carrie's feet upon the stair, his nerve failed him.  He sank a
little in determination, for he was not so sure, after all, what her
opinion might be.

When she entered the room, however, her appearance gave him courage.
She looked simple and charming enough to strengthen the daring of any
lover.  Her apparent nervousness dispelled his own.

"How are you?" he said, easily.  "I could not resist the temptation to
come out this afternoon, it was so pleasant."

"Yes," said Carrie, halting before him, "I was just preparing to go for
a walk myself."

"Oh, were you?" he said.  "Supposing, then, you get your hat and we
both go?"

They crossed the park and went west along Washington Boulevard,
beautiful with its broad macadamized road, and large frame houses set
back from the sidewalks.  It was a street where many of the more
prosperous residents of the West Side lived, and Hurstwood could not
help feeling nervous over the publicity of it.  They had gone but a few
blocks when a livery stable sign in one of the side streets solved the
difficulty for him.  He would take her to drive along the new
Boulevard.

The Boulevard at that time was little more than a country road. The
part he intended showing her was much farther out on this same West
Side, where there was scarcely a house.  It connected Douglas Park with
Washington or South Park, and was nothing more than a neatly MADE road,
running due south for some five miles over an open, grassy prairie, and
then due east over the same kind of prairie for the same distance.
There was not a house to be encountered anywhere along the larger part
of the route, and any conversation would be pleasantly free of
interruption.

At the stable he picked a gentle horse, and they were soon out of range
of either public observation or hearing.

"Can you drive?" he said, after a time.

"I never tried," said Carrie.

He put the reins in her hand, and folded his arms.

"You see there's nothing to it much," he said, smilingly.

"Not when you have a gentle horse," said Carrie.

"You can handle a horse as well as any one, after a little practice,"
he added, encouragingly.

He had been looking for some time for a break in the conversation when
he could give it a serious turn.  Once or twice he had held his peace,
hoping that in silence her thoughts would take the color of his own,
but she had lightly continued the subject. Presently, however, his
silence controlled the situation.  The drift of his thoughts began to
tell.  He gazed fixedly at nothing in particular, as if he were
thinking of something which concerned her not at all.  His thoughts,
however, spoke for themselves.  She was very much aware that a climax
was pending.

"Do you know," he said, "I have spent the happiest evenings in years
since I have known you?"

"Have you?" she said, with assumed airiness, but still excited by the
conviction which the tone of his voice carried.

"I was going to tell you the other evening," he added, "but somehow the
opportunity slipped away."

Carrie was listening without attempting to reply.  She could think of
nothing worth while to say.  Despite all the ideas concerning right
which had troubled her vaguely since she had last seen him, she was now
influenced again strongly in his favor.

"I came out here to-day," he went on, solemnly, "to tell you just how I
feel--to see if you wouldn't listen to me."

Hurstwood was something of a romanticist after his kind.  He was
capable of strong feelings--often poetic ones--and under a stress of
desire, such as the present, he waxed eloquent.  That is, his feelings
and his voice were colored with that seeming repression and pathos
which is the essence of eloquence.

"You know," he said, putting his hand on her arm, and keeping a strange
silence while he formulated words, "that I love you?" Carrie did not
stir at the words.  She was bound up completely in the man's
atmosphere.  He would have churchlike silence in order to express his
feelings, and she kept it.  She did not move her eyes from the flat,
open scene before her.  Hurstwood waited for a few moments, and then
repeated the words.

"You must not say that," she said, weakly.

Her words were not convincing at all.  They were the result of a feeble
thought that something ought to be said.  He paid no attention to them
whatever.

"Carrie," he said, using her first name with sympathetic familiarity,
"I want you to love me.  You don't know how much I need some one to
waste a little affection on me.  I am practically alone.  There is
nothing in my life that is pleasant or delightful.  It's all work and
worry with people who are nothing to me."

As he said this, Hurstwood really imagined that his state was pitiful.
He had the ability to get off at a distance and view himself
objectively--of seeing what he wanted to see in the things which made
up his existence.  Now, as he spoke, his voice trembled with that
peculiar vibration which is the result of tensity.  It went ringing
home to his companion's heart.

"Why, I should think," she said, turning upon him large eyes which were
full of sympathy and feeling, "that you would be very happy.  You know
so much of the world."

"That is it," he said, his voice dropping to a soft minor, "I know too
much of the world."

It was an important thing to her to hear one so well-positioned and
powerful speaking in this manner.  She could not help feeling the
strangeness of her situation.  How was it that, in so little a while,
the narrow life of the country had fallen from her as a garment, and
the city, with all its mystery, taken its place? Here was this greatest
mystery, the man of money and affairs sitting beside her, appealing to
her.  Behold, he had ease and comfort, his strength was great, his
position high, his clothing rich, and yet he was appealing to her.  She
could formulate no thought which would be just and right.  She troubled
herself no more upon the matter.  She only basked in the warmth of his
feeling, which was as a grateful blaze to one who is cold. Hurstwood
glowed with his own intensity, and the heat of his passion was already
melting the wax of his companion's scruples.

"You think," he said, "I am happy; that I ought not to complain? If you
were to meet all day with people who care absolutely nothing about you,
if you went day after day to a place where there was nothing but show
and indifference, if there was not one person in all those you knew to
whom you could appeal for sympathy or talk to with pleasure, perhaps
you would be unhappy too.

He was striking a chord now which found sympathetic response in her own
situation.  She knew what it was to meet with people who were
indifferent, to walk alone amid so many who cared absolutely nothing
about you.  Had not she?  Was not she at this very moment quite alone?
Who was there among all whom she knew to whom she could appeal for
sympathy?  Not one.  She was left to herself to brood and wonder.

"I could be content," went on Hurstwood, "if I had you to love me.  If
I had you to go to; you for a companion.  As it is, I simply move about
from place to place without any satisfaction. Time hangs heavily on my
hands.  Before you came I did nothing but idle and drift into anything
that offered itself.  Since you came--well, I've had you to think
about."

The old illusion that here was some one who needed her aid began to
grow in Carrie's mind.  She truly pitied this sad, lonely figure.  To
think that all his fine state should be so barren for want of her; that
he needed to make such an appeal when she herself was lonely and
without anchor.  Surely, this was too bad.

"I am not very bad," he said, apologetically, as if he owed it to her
to explain on this score.  "You think, probably, that I roam around,
and get into all sorts of evil?  I have been rather reckless, but I
could easily come out of that.  I need you to draw me back, if my life
ever amounts to anything."

Carrie looked at him with the tenderness which virtue ever feels in its
hope of reclaiming vice.  How could such a man need reclaiming?  His
errors, what were they, that she could correct? Small they must be,
where all was so fine.  At worst, they were gilded affairs, and with
what leniency are gilded errors viewed. He put himself in such a lonely
light that she was deeply moved.

"Is it that way?" she mused.

He slipped his arm about her waist, and she could not find the heart to
draw away.  With his free hand he seized upon her fingers.  A breath of
soft spring wind went bounding over the road, rolling some brown twigs
of the previous autumn before it. The horse paced leisurely on,
unguided.

"Tell me," he said, softly, "that you love me."

Her eyes fell consciously.

"Own to it, dear," he said, feelingly; "you do, don't you?"

She made no answer, but he felt his victory.

"Tell me," he said, richly, drawing her so close that their lips were
near together.  He pressed her hand warmly, and then released it to
touch her cheek.

"You do?" he said, pressing his lips to her own.

For answer, her lips replied.

"Now," he said, joyously, his fine eyes ablaze, "you're my own girl,
aren't you?"

By way of further conclusion, her head lay softly upon his shoulder.


Chapter XIV
WITH EYES AND NOT SEEING--ONE INFLUENCE WANES

 Carrie in her rooms that evening was in a fine glow, physically and
mentally.  She was deeply rejoicing in her affection for Hurstwood and
his love, and looked forward with fine fancy to their next meeting
Sunday night.  They had agreed, without any feeling of enforced
secrecy, that she should come down town and meet him, though, after
all, the need of it was the cause.

Mrs. Hale, from her upper window, saw her come in.

"Um," she thought to herself, "she goes riding with another man when
her husband is out of the city.  He had better keep an eye on her."

The truth is that Mrs. Hale was not the only one who had a thought on
this score.  The housemaid who had welcomed Hurstwood had her opinion
also.  She had no particular regard for Carrie, whom she took to be
cold and disagreeable.  At the same time, she had a fancy for the merry
and easy-mannered Drouet, who threw her a pleasant remark now and then,
and in other ways extended her the evidence of that regard which he had
for all members of the sex.  Hurstwood was more reserved and critical
in his manner.  He did not appeal to this bodiced functionary in the
same pleasant way.  She wondered that he came so frequently, that Mrs.
Drouet should go out with him this afternoon when Mr. Drouet was
absent. She gave vent to her opinions in the kitchen where the cook
was. As a result, a hum of gossip was set going which moved about the
house in that secret manner common to gossip.

Carrie, now that she had yielded sufficiently to Hurstwood to confess
her affection, no longer troubled about her attitude towards him.
Temporarily she gave little thought to Drouet, thinking only of the
dignity and grace of her lover and of his consuming affection for her.
On the first evening, she did little but go over the details of the
afternoon.  It was the first time her sympathies had ever been
thoroughly aroused, and they threw a new light on her character.  She
had some power of initiative, latent before, which now began to exert
itself.  She looked more practically upon her state and began to see
glimmerings of a way out.  Hurstwood seemed a drag in the direction of
honor.  Her feelings were exceedingly creditable, in that they
constructed out of these recent developments something which conquered
freedom from dishonor.  She had no idea what Hurstwood's next word
would be.  She only took his affection to be a fine thing, and appended
better, more generous results accordingly.

As yet, Hurstwood had only a thought of pleasure without
responsibility.  He did not feel that he was doing anything to
complicate his life.  His position was secure, his home-life, if not
satisfactory, was at least undisturbed, his personal liberty rather
untrammelled.  Carrie's love represented only so much added pleasure.
He would enjoy this new gift over and above his ordinary allowance of
pleasure.  He would be happy with her and his own affairs would go on
as they had, undisturbed.

On Sunday evening Carrie dined with him at a place he had selected in
East Adams Street, and thereafter they took a cab to what was then a
pleasant evening resort out on Cottage Grove Avenue near 39th Street.
In the process of his declaration he soon realized that Carrie took his
love upon a higher basis than he had anticipated.  She kept him at a
distance in a rather earnest way, and submitted only to those tender
tokens of affection which better become the inexperienced lover.
Hurstwood saw that she was not to be possessed for the asking, and
deferred pressing his suit too warmly.

Since he feigned to believe in her married state he found that he had
to carry out the part.  His triumph, he saw, was still at a little
distance.  How far he could not guess.

They were returning to Ogden Place in the cab, when he asked:

"When will I see you again?"

"I don't know," she answered, wondering herself.

"Why not come down to The Fair," he suggested, "next Tuesday?"

She shook her head.

"Not so soon," she answered.

"I'll tell you what I'll do," he added.  "I'll write you, care of this
West Side Post-office.  Could you call next Tuesday?"

Carrie assented.

The cab stopped one door out of the way according to his call.

"Good-night," he whispered, as the cab rolled away.

Unfortunately for the smooth progression of this affair, Drouet
returned.  Hurstwood was sitting in his imposing little office the next
afternoon when he saw Drouet enter.

"Why, hello, Charles," he called affably; "back again?"

"Yes," smiled Drouet, approaching and looking in at the door.

Hurstwood arose.

"Well," he said, looking the drummer over, "rosy as ever, eh?"

They began talking of the people they knew and things that had
happened.

"Been home yet?" finally asked Hurstwood.

"No, I am going, though," said Drouet.

"I remembered the little girl out there," said Hurstwood, "and called
once.  Thought you wouldn't want her left quite alone."

"Right you are," agreed Drouet.  "How is she?"

"Very well," said Hurstwood.  "Rather anxious about you though. You'd
better go out now and cheer her up."

"I will," said Drouet, smilingly.

"Like to have you both come down and go to the show with me Wednesday,"
concluded Hurstwood at parting.

"Thanks, old man," said his friend, "I'll see what the girl says and
let you know."

They separated in the most cordial manner.

"There's a nice fellow," Drouet thought to himself as he turned the
corner towards Madison.

"Drouet is a good fellow," Hurstwood thought to himself as he went back
into his office, "but he's no man for Carrie."

The thought of the latter turned his mind into a most pleasant vein,
and he wandered how he would get ahead of the drummer.

When Drouet entered Carrie's presence, he caught her in his arms as
usual, but she responded to his kiss with a tremor of opposition.

"Well," he said, "I had a great trip."

"Did you? How did you come out with that La Crosse man you were telling
me about?"

"Oh, fine; sold him a complete line.  There was another fellow there,
representing Burnstein, a regular hook-nosed sheeny, but he wasn't in
it.  I made him look like nothing at all."

As he undid his collar and unfastened his studs, preparatory to washing
his face and changing his clothes, he dilated upon his trip.  Carrie
could not help listening with amusement to his animated descriptions.

"I tell you," he said, "I surprised the people at the office. I've sold
more goods this last quarter than any other man of our house on the
road.  I sold three thousand dollars' worth in La Crosse."

He plunged his face in a basin of water, and puffed and blew as he
rubbed his neck and ears with his hands, while Carrie gazed upon him
with mingled thoughts of recollection and present judgment.  He was
still wiping his face, when he continued:

"I'm going to strike for a raise in June.  They can afford to pay it,
as much business as I turn in.  I'll get it too, don't you forget."

"I hope you do," said Carrie.

"And then if that little real estate deal I've got on goes through,
we'll get married," he said with a great show of earnestness, the while
he took his place before the mirror and began brushing his hair.

"I don't believe you ever intend to marry me, Charlie," Carrie said
ruefully.  The recent protestations of Hurstwood had given her courage
to say this.

"Oh, yes I do--course I do--what put that into your head?"

He had stopped his trifling before the mirror now and crossed over to
her.  For the first time Carrie felt as if she must move away from him.

"But you've been saying that so long," she said, looking with her
pretty face upturned into his.

"Well, and I mean it too, but it takes money to live as I want to.
Now, when I get this increase, I can come pretty near fixing things all
right, and I'll do it.  Now, don't you worry, girlie."

He patted her reassuringly upon the shoulder, but Carrie felt how
really futile had been her hopes.  She could clearly see that this
easy-going soul intended no move in her behalf.  He was simply letting
things drift because he preferred the free round of his present state
to any legal trammelings.

In contrast, Hurstwood appeared strong and sincere.  He had no easy
manner of putting her off.  He sympathized with her and showed her what
her true value was.  He needed her, while Drouet did not care.

"Oh, no," she said remorsefully, her tone reflecting some of her own
success and more of her helplessness, "you never will."

"Well, you wait a little while and see," he concluded.  "I'll marry you
all right."

Carrie looked at him and felt justified.  She was looking for something
which would calm her conscience, and here it was, a light, airy
disregard of her claims upon his justice.  He had faithfully promised
to marry her, and this was the way he fulfilled his promise.

"Say," he said, after he had, as he thought, pleasantly disposed of the
marriage question, "I saw Hurstwood to-day, and he wants us to go to
the theatre with him."

Carrie started at the name, but recovered quickly enough to avoid
notice.

"When?" she asked, with assumed indifference.

"Wednesday.  We'll go, won't we?"

"If you think so," she answered, her manner being so enforcedly
reserved as to almost excite suspicion.  Drouet noticed something but
he thought it was due to her feelings concerning their talk about
marriage. "He called once, he said."

"Yes," said Carrie, "he was out here Sunday evening."

"Was he?" said Drouet.  "I thought from what he said that he had called
a week or so ago."

"So he did," answered Carrie, who was wholly unaware of what
conversation her lovers might have held.  She was all at sea mentally,
and fearful of some entanglement which might ensue from what she would
answer.

"Oh, then he called twice?" said Drouet, the first shade of
misunderstanding showing in his face.

"Yes," said Carrie innocently, feeling now that Hurstwood must have
mentioned but one call.

Drouet imagined that he must have misunderstood his friend.  He did not
attach particular importance to the information, after all.

"What did he have to say?" he queried, with slightly increased
curiosity.

"He said he came because he thought I might be lonely.  You hadn't been
in there so long he wondered what had become of you."

"George is a fine fellow," said Drouet, rather gratified by his
conception of the manager's interest.  "Come on and we'll go out to
dinner."

When Hurstwood saw that Drouet was back he wrote at once to Carrie,
saying:

"I told him I called on you, dearest, when he was away.  I did not say
how often, but he probably thought once.  Let me know of anything you
may have said.  Answer by special messenger when you get this, and,
darling, I must see you.  Let me know if you can't meet me at Jackson
and Throop Streets Wednesday afternoon at two o'clock.  I want to speak
with you before we meet at the theatre."

Carrie received this Tuesday morning when she called at the West Side
branch of the post-office, and answered at once.

"I said you called twice," she wrote.  "He didn't seem to mind. I will
try and be at Throop Street if nothing interferes.  I seem to be
getting very bad.  It's wrong to act as I do, I know."

Hurstwood, when he met her as agreed, reassured her on this score.

"You mustn't worry, sweetheart," he said.  "Just as soon as he goes on
the road again we will arrange something.  We'll fix it so that you
won't have to deceive any one."

Carrie imagined that he would marry her at once, though he had not
directly said so, and her spirits rose.  She proposed to make the best
of the situation until Drouet left again.

"Don't show any more interest in me than you ever have," Hurstwood
counseled concerning the evening at the theatre.

"You mustn't look at me steadily then," she answered, mindful of the
power of his eyes.

"I won't," he said, squeezing her hand at parting and giving the glance
she had just cautioned against.

"There," she said playfully, pointing a finger at him.

"The show hasn't begun yet," he returned.

He watched her walk from him with tender solicitation.  Such youth and
prettiness reacted upon him more subtly than wine.

At the theatre things passed as they had in Hurstwood's favor. If he
had been pleasing to Carrie before, how much more so was he now.  His
grace was more permeating because it found a readier medium.  Carrie
watched his every movement with pleasure.  She almost forgot poor
Drouet, who babbled on as if he were the host.

Hurstwood was too clever to give the slightest indication of a change.
He paid, if anything, more attention to his old friend than usual, and
yet in no way held him up to that subtle ridicule which a lover in
favor may so secretly practice before the mistress of his heart.  If
anything, he felt the injustice of the game as it stood, and was not
cheap enough to add to it the slightest mental taunt.

Only the play produced an ironical situation, and this was due to
Drouet alone.

The scene was one in "The Covenant," in which the wife listened to the
seductive voice of a lover in the absence of her husband.

"Served him right," said Drouet afterward, even in view of her keen
expiation of her error.  "I haven't any pity for a man who would be
such a chump as that."

"Well, you never can tell," returned Hurstwood gently.  "He probably
thought he was right."

"Well, a man ought to be more attentive than that to his wife if he
wants to keep her."

They had come out of the lobby and made their way through the showy
crush about the entrance way.

"Say, mister," said a voice at Hurstwood's side, "would you mind giving
me the price of a bed?"

Hurstwood was interestedly remarking to Carrie.

"Honest to God, mister, I'm without a place to sleep."

The plea was that of a gaunt-faced man of about thirty, who looked the
picture of privation and wretchedness.  Drouet was the first to see.
He handed over a dime with an upwelling feeling of pity in his heart.
Hurstwood scarcely noticed the incident. Carrie quickly forgot.



Chapter XV
THE IRK OF THE OLD TIES--THE MAGIC OF YOUTH

 The complete ignoring by Hurstwood of his own home came with the
growth of his affection for Carrie.  His actions, in all that related
to his family, were of the most perfunctory kind.  He sat at breakfast
with his wife and children, absorbed in his own fancies, which reached
far without the realm of their interests. He read his paper, which was
heightened in interest by the shallowness of the themes discussed by
his son and daughter. Between himself and his wife ran a river of
indifference.

Now that Carrie had come, he was in a fair way to be blissful again.
There was delight in going down town evenings.  When he walked forth in
the short days, the street lamps had a merry twinkle.  He began to
experience the almost forgotten feeling which hastens the lover's feet.
When he looked at his fine clothes, he saw them with her eyes--and her
eyes were young.

When in the flush of such feelings he heard his wife's voice, when the
insistent demands of matrimony recalled him from dreams to a stale
practice, how it grated.  He then knew that this was a chain which
bound his feet.

"George," said Mrs. Hurstwood, in that tone of voice which had long
since come to be associated in his mind with demands, "we want you to
get us a season ticket to the races."

"Do you want to go to all of them?" he said with a rising inflection.

"Yes," she answered.

The races in question were soon to open at Washington Park, on the
South Side, and were considered quite society affairs among those who
did not affect religious rectitude and conservatism. Mrs. Hurstwood had
never asked for a whole season ticket before, but this year certain
considerations decided her to get a box. For one thing, one of her
neighbors, a certain Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey, who were possessors of money,
made out of the coal business, had done so.  In the next place, her
favorite physician, Dr. Beale, a gentleman inclined to horses and
betting, had talked with her concerning his intention to enter a two-
year old in the Derby.  In the third place, she wished to exhibit
Jessica, who was gaining in maturity and beauty, and whom she hoped to
marry to a man of means.  Her own desire to be about in such things and
parade among her acquaintances and common throng was as much an
incentive as anything.

Hurstwood thought over the proposition a few moments without answering.
They were in the sitting room on the second floor, waiting for supper.
It was the evening of his engagement with Carrie and Drouet to see "The
Covenant," which had brought him home to make some alterations in his
dress.

"You're sure separate tickets wouldn't do as well?" he asked,
hesitating to say anything more rugged.

"No," she replied impatiently.

"Well," he said, taking offence at her manner, "you needn't get mad
about it.  I'm just asking you."

"I'm not mad," she snapped.  "I'm merely asking you for a season
ticket."

"And I'm telling you," he returned, fixing a clear, steady eye on her,
"that it's no easy thing to get.  I'm not sure whether the manager will
give it to me."

He had been thinking all the time of his "pull" with the racetrack
magnates.

"We can buy it then," she exclaimed sharply.

"You talk easy," he said.  "A season family ticket costs one hundred
and fifty dollars."

"I'll not argue with you," she replied with determination.  "I want the
ticket and that's all there is to it."

She had risen, and now walked angrily out of the room.

"Well, you get it then," he said grimly, though in a modified tone of
voice.

As usual, the table was one short that evening.

The next morning he had cooled down considerably, and later the ticket
was duly secured, though it did not heal matters.  He did not mind
giving his family a fair share of all that he earned, but he did not
like to be forced to provide against his will.

"Did you know, mother," said Jessica another day, "the Spencers are
getting ready to go away?"

"No.  Where, I wonder?"

"Europe," said Jessica.  "I met Georgine yesterday and she told me.
She just put on more airs about it."

"Did she say when?"

"Monday, I think.  They'll get a notice in the papers again--they
always do."

"Never mind," said Mrs. Hurstwood consolingly, "we'll go one of these
days."

Hurstwood moved his eyes over the paper slowly, but said nothing.

"'We sail for Liverpool from New York,'" Jessica exclaimed, mocking her
acquaintance.  "'Expect to spend most of the "summah" in France,'--vain
thing.  As If it was anything to go to Europe."

"It must be if you envy her so much," put in Hurstwood.

It grated upon him to see the feeling his daughter displayed.

"Don't worry over them, my dear," said Mrs. Hurstwood.

"Did George get off?" asked Jessica of her mother another day, thus
revealing something that Hurstwood had heard nothing about.

"Where has he gone?" he asked, looking up.  He had never before been
kept in ignorance concerning departures.

"He was going to Wheaton," said Jessica, not noticing the slight put
upon her father.

"What's out there?" he asked, secretly irritated and chagrined to think
that he should be made to pump for information in this manner.

"A tennis match," said Jessica.

"He didn't say anything to me," Hurstwood concluded, finding it
difficult to refrain from a bitter tone.

"I guess he must have forgotten," exclaimed his wife blandly.  In the
past he had always commanded a certain amount of respect, which was a
compound of appreciation and awe.  The familiarity which in part still
existed between himself and his daughter he had courted.  As it was, it
did not go beyond the light assumption of words.  The TONE was always
modest.  Whatever had been, however, had lacked affection, and now he
saw that he was losing track of their doings.  His knowledge was no
longer intimate.  He sometimes saw them at table, and sometimes did
not. He heard of their doings occasionally, more often not.  Some days
he found that he was all at sea as to what they were talking about--
things they had arranged to do or that they had done in his absence.
More affecting was the feeling that there were little things going on
of which he no longer heard.  Jessica was beginning to feel that her
affairs were her own.  George, Jr., flourished about as if he were a
man entirely and must needs have private matters.  All this Hurstwood
could see, and it left a trace of feeling, for he was used to being
considered--in his official position, at least--and felt that his
importance should not begin to wane here.  To darken it all, he saw the
same indifference and independence growing in his wife, while he looked
on and paid the bills.

He consoled himself with the thought, however, that, after all, he was
not without affection.  Things might go as they would at his house, but
he had Carrie outside of it.  With his mind's eye he looked into her
comfortable room in Ogden Place, where he had spent several such
delightful evenings, and thought how charming it would be when Drouet
was disposed of entirely and she was waiting evenings in cozy little
quarters for him.  That no cause would come up whereby Drouet would be
led to inform Carrie concerning his married state, he felt hopeful.
Things were going so smoothly that he believed they would not change.
Shortly now he would persuade Carrie and all would be satisfactory.

The day after their theatre visit he began writing her regularly-a
letter every morning, and begging her to do as much for him. He was not
literary by any means, but experience of the world and his growing
affection gave him somewhat of a style.  This he exercised at his
office desk with perfect deliberation.  He purchased a box of
delicately colored and scented writing paper in monogram, which he kept
locked in one of the drawers.  His friends now wondered at the cleric
and very official-looking nature of his position.  The five bartenders
viewed with respect the duties which could call a man to do so much
desk-work and penmanship.

Hurstwood surprised himself with his fluency.  By the natural law which
governs all effort, what he wrote reacted upon him.  He began to feel
those subtleties which he could find words to express.  With every
expression came increased conception.  Those inmost breathings which
there found words took hold upon him.  He thought Carrie worthy of all
the affection he could there express.

Carrie was indeed worth loving if ever youth and grace are to command
that token of acknowledgment from life in their bloom. Experience had
not yet taken away that freshness of the spirit which is the charm of
the body.  Her soft eyes contained in their liquid luster no suggestion
of the knowledge of disappointment. She had been troubled in a way by
doubt and longing, but these had made no deeper impression than could
be traced in a certain open wistfulness of glance and speech.  The
mouth had the expression at times, in talking and in repose, of one who
might be upon the verge of tears.  It was not that grief was thus ever
present.  The pronunciation of certain syllables gave to her lips this
peculiarity of formation--a formation as suggestive and moving as
pathos itself.

There was nothing bold in her manner.  Life had not taught her
domination--superciliousness of grace, which is the lordly power of
some women.  Her longing for consideration was not sufficiently
powerful to move her to demand it.  Even now she lacked self-assurance,
but there was that in what she had already experienced which left her a
little less than timid.  She wanted pleasure, she wanted position, and
yet she was confused as to what these things might be.  Every hour the
kaleidoscope of human affairs threw a new luster upon something, and
therewith it became for her the desired--the all.  Another shift of the
box, and some other had become the beautiful, the perfect.

On her spiritual side, also, she was rich in feeling, as such a nature
well might be.  Sorrow in her was aroused by many a spectacle--an
uncritical upwelling of grief for the weak and the helpless.  She was
constantly pained by the sight of the white-faced, ragged men who
slopped desperately by her in a sort of wretched mental stupor.  The
poorly clad girls who went blowing by her window evenings, hurrying
home from some of the shops of the West Side, she pitied from the
depths of her heart.  She would stand and bite her lips as they passed,
shaking her little head and wondering.  They had so little, she
thought.  It was so sad to be ragged and poor.  The hang of faded
clothes pained her eyes.

"And they have to work so hard!" was her only comment.

On the street sometimes she would see men working--Irishmen with picks,
coal-heavers with great loads to shovel, Americans busy about some work
which was a mere matter of strength--and they touched her fancy.  Toil,
now that she was free of it, seemed even a more desolate thing than
when she was part of it.  She saw it through a mist of fancy--a pale,
somber half-light, which was the essence of poetic feeling.  Her old
father, in his flour dusted miller's suit, sometimes returned to her in
memory, revived by a face in a window.  A shoemaker pegging at his
last, a blast man seen through a narrow window in some basement where
iron was being melted, a bench-worker seen high aloft in some window,
his coat off, his sleeves rolled up; these took her back in fancy to
the details of the mill.  She felt, though she seldom expressed them,
sad thoughts upon this score.  Her sympathies were ever with that
under-world of toil from which she had so recently sprung, and which
she best understood.

Though Hurstwood did not know it, he was dealing with one whose
feelings were as tender and as delicate as this.  He did not know, but
it was this in her, after all, which attracted him.  He never attempted
to analyze the nature of his affection.  It was sufficient that there
was tenderness in her eye, weakness in her manner, good nature and hope
in her thoughts.  He drew near this lily, which had sucked its waxen
beauty and perfume from below a depth of waters which he had never
penetrated, and out of ooze and mould which he could not understand.
He drew near because it was waxen and fresh.  It lightened his feelings
for him.  It made the morning worth while.

In a material way, she was considerably improved.  Her awkwardness had
all but passed, leaving, if anything, a quaint residue which was as
pleasing as perfect grace.  Her little shoes now fitted her smartly and
had high heels.  She had learned much about laces and those little
neckpieces which add so much to a woman's appearance.  Her form had
filled out until it was admirably plump and well-rounded.

Hurstwood wrote her one morning, asking her to meet him in Jefferson
Park, Monroe Street.  He did not consider it policy to call any more,
even when Drouet was at home.

The next afternoon he was in the pretty little park by one, and had
found a rustic bench beneath the green leaves of a lilac bush which
bordered one of the paths.  It was at that season of the year when the
fullness of spring had not yet worn quite away.  At a little pond near
by some cleanly dressed children were sailing white canvas boats.  In
the shade of a green pagoda a bebuttoned officer of the law was
resting, his arms folded, his club at rest in his belt.  An old
gardener was upon the lawn, with a pair of pruning shears, looking
after some bushes.  High overhead was the clean blue sky of the new
summer, and in the thickness of the shiny green leaves of the trees
hopped and twittered the busy sparrows.

Hurstwood had come out of his own home that morning feeling much of the
same old annoyance.  At his store he had idled, there being no need to
write.  He had come away to this place with the lightness of heart
which characterizes those who put weariness behind.  Now, in the shade
of this cool, green bush, he looked about him with the fancy of the
lover.  He heard the carts go lumbering by upon the neighboring
streets, but they were far off, and only buzzed upon his ear.  The hum
of the surrounding city was faint, the clang of an occasional bell was
as music.  He looked and dreamed a new dream of pleasure which
concerned his present fixed condition not at all.  He got back in fancy
to the old Hurstwood, who was neither married nor fixed in a solid
position for life.  He remembered the light spirit in which he once
looked after the girls--how he had danced, escorted them home, hung
over their gates.  He almost wished he was back there again--here in
this pleasant scene he felt as if he were wholly free.

At two Carrie came tripping along the walk toward him, rosy and clean.
She had just recently donned a sailor hat for the season with a band of
pretty white-dotted blue silk.  Her skirt was of a rich blue material,
and her shirt waist matched it, with a thin stripe of blue upon a snow-
white ground--stripes that were as fine as hairs.  Her brown shoes
peeped occasionally from beneath her skirt.  She carried her gloves in
her hand.

Hurstwood looked up at her with delight.

"You came, dearest," he said eagerly, standing to meet her and taking
her hand.

"Of course," she said, smiling; "did you think I wouldn't?"

"I didn't know," he replied.

He looked at her forehead, which was moist from her brisk walk. Then he
took out one of his own soft, scented silk handkerchiefs and touched
her face here and there.

"Now," he said affectionately, "you're all right."

They were happy in being near one another--in looking into each other's
eyes.  Finally, when the long flush of delight had sub sided, he said:

"When is Charlie going away again?"

"I don't know," she answered.  "He says he has some things to do for
the house here now."

Hurstwood grew serious, and he lapsed into quiet thought.  He looked up
after a time to say:

"Come away and leave him."

He turned his eyes to the boys with the boats, as if the request were
of little importance.

"Where would we go?" she asked in much the same manner, rolling her
gloves, and looking into a neighboring tree.

"Where do you want to go?" he enquired.

There was something in the tone in which he said this which made her
feel as if she must record her feelings against any local habitation.

"We can't stay in Chicago," she replied.

He had no thought that this was in her mind--that any removal would be
suggested.

"Why not?" he asked softly.

"Oh, because," she said, "I wouldn't want to."

He listened to this with but dull perception of what it meant. It had
no serious ring to it.  The question was not up for immediate decision.

"I would have to give up my position," he said.

The tone he used made it seem as if the matter deserved only slight
consideration.  Carrie thought a little, the while enjoying the pretty
scene.

"I wouldn't like to live in Chicago and him here," she said, thinking
of Drouet.

"It's a big town, dearest," Hurstwood answered.  "It would be as good
as moving to another part of the country to move to the South Side."

He had fixed upon that region as an objective point.

"Anyhow," said Carrie, "I shouldn't want to get married as long as he
is here.  I wouldn't want to run away."

The suggestion of marriage struck Hurstwood forcibly.  He saw clearly
that this was her idea--he felt that it was not to be gotten over
easily.  Bigamy lightened the horizon of his shadowy thoughts for a
moment.  He wondered for the life of him how it would all come out.  He
could not see that he was making any progress save in her regard.  When
he looked at her now, he thought her beautiful.  What a thing it was to
have her love him, even if it be entangling! She increased in value in
his eyes because of her objection.  She was something to struggle for,
and that was everything.  How different from the women who yielded
willingly! He swept the thought of them from his mind.

"And you don't know when he'll go away?" asked Hurstwood, quietly.

She shook her head.

He sighed.

"You're a determined little miss, aren't you?" he said, after a few
moments, looking up into her eyes.

She felt a wave of feeling sweep over her at this.  It was pride at
what seemed his admiration--affection for the man who could feel this
concerning her.

"No," she said coyly, "but what can I do?"

Again he folded his hands and looked away over the lawn into the
street.

"I wish," he said pathetically, "you would come to me.  I don't like to
be away from you this way.  What good is there in waiting? You're not
any happier, are you?"

"Happier!" she exclaimed softly, "you know better than that."

"Here we are then," he went on in the same tone, "wasting our days.  If
you are not happy, do you think I am? I sit and write to you the
biggest part of the time.  I'll tell you what, Carrie," he exclaimed,
throwing sudden force of expression into his voice and fixing her with
his eyes, "I can't live without you, and that's all there is to it.
Now," he concluded, showing the palm of one of his white hands in a
sort of at-an-end, helpless expression, "what shall I do?"

This shifting of the burden to her appealed to Carrie.  The semblance
of the load without the weight touched the woman's heart.

"Can't you wait a little while yet?" she said tenderly.  "I'll try and
find out when he's going."

"What good will it do?" he asked, holding the same strain of feeling.

"Well, perhaps we can arrange to go somewhere."

She really did not see anything clearer than before, but she was
getting into that frame of mind where, out of sympathy, a woman yields.

Hurstwood did not understand.  He was wondering how she was to be
persuaded--what appeal would move her to forsake Drouet.  He began to
wonder how far her affection for him would carry her. He was thinking
of some question which would make her tell.

Finally he hit upon one of those problematical propositions which often
disguise our own desires while leading us to an understanding of the
difficulties which others make for us, and so discover for us a way.
It had not the slightest connection with anything intended on his part,
and was spoken at random before he had given it a moment's serious
thought.

"Carrie," he said, looking into her face and assuming a serious look
which he did not feel, "suppose I were to come to you next week, or
this week for that matter--to-night say--and tell you I had to go away-
-that I couldn't stay another minute and wasn't coming back any more--
would you come with me?" His sweetheart viewed him with the most
affectionate glance, her answer ready before the words were out of his
mouth.

"Yes," she said.

"You wouldn't stop to argue or arrange?"

"Not if you couldn't wait."

He smiled when he saw that she took him seriously, and he thought what
a chance it would afford for a possible junket of a week or two.  He
had a notion to tell her that he was joking and so brush away her sweet
seriousness, but the effect of it was too delightful.  He let it stand.

"Suppose we didn't have time to get married here?" he added, an
afterthought striking him.

"If we got married as soon as we got to the other end of the journey it
would be all right."

"I meant that," he said.

"Yes."

The morning seemed peculiarly bright to him now.  He wondered whatever
could have put such a thought into his head.  Impossible as it was, he
could not help smiling at its cleverness.  It showed how she loved him.
There was no doubt in his mind now, and he would find a way to win her.

"Well," he said, jokingly, "I'll come and get you one of these
evenings," and then he laughed.

"I wouldn't stay with you, though, if you didn't marry me," Carrie
added reflectively.

"I don't want you to," he said tenderly, taking her hand.

She was extremely happy now that she understood.  She loved him the
more for thinking that he would rescue her so.  As for him, the
marriage clause did not dwell in his mind.  He was thinking that with
such affection there could be no bar to his eventual happiness.

"Let's stroll about," he said gaily, rising and surveying all the
lovely park.

"All right," said Carrie.

They passed the young Irishman, who looked after them with envious
eyes.

"'Tis a foine couple," he observed to himself.  "They must be rich."




Chapter XVI
A WITLESS ALADDIN--THE GATE TO THE WORLD

 In the course of his present stay in Chicago, Drouet paid some slight
attention to the secret order to which he belonged. During his last
trip he had received a new light on its importance.

"I tell you," said another drummer to him, "it's a great thing. Look at
Hazenstab.  He isn't so deuced clever.  Of course he's got a good house
behind him, but that won't do alone.  I tell you it's his degree.  He's
a way-up Mason, and that goes a long way. He's got a secret sign that
stands for something."

Drouet resolved then and there that he would take more interest in such
matters.  So when he got back to Chicago he repaired to his local lodge
headquarters.

"I say, Drouet," said Mr. Harry Quincel, an individual who was very
prominent in this local branch of the Elks, "you're the man that can
help us out."

It was after the business meeting and things were going socially with a
hum.  Drouet was bobbing around chatting and joking with a score of
individuals whom he knew.

"What are you up to?" he inquired genially, turning a smiling face upon
his secret brother.

"We're trying to get up some theatricals for two weeks from today, and
we want to know if you don't know some young lady who could take a
part--it's an easy part."

"Sure," said Drouet, "what is it?" He did not trouble to remember that
he knew no one to whom he could appeal on this score.  His innate good-
nature, however, dictated a favorable reply.

"Well, now, I'll tell you what we are trying to do," went on Mr.
Quincel.  "We are trying to get a new set of furniture for the lodge.
There isn't enough money in the treasury at the present time, and we
thought we would raise it by a little entertainment."

"Sure," interrupted Drouet, "that's a good idea."

"Several of the boys around here have got talent.  There's Harry
Burbeck, he does a fine black-face turn.  Mac Lewis is all right at
heavy dramatics.  Did you ever hear him recite 'Over the Hills'?"

"Never did."

"Well, I tell you, he does it fine."

"And you want me to get some woman to take a part?" questioned Drouet,
anxious to terminate the subject and get on to something else.  "What
are you going to play?"

"'Under the Gaslight,'" said Mr. Quincel, mentioning Augustin Daly's
famous production, which had worn from a great public success down to
an amateur theatrical favorite, with many of the troublesome
accessories cut out and the dramatis personae reduced to the smallest
possible number.

Drouet had seen this play some time in the past.

"That's it," he said; "that's a fine play.  It will go all right. You
ought to make a lot of money out of that."

"We think we'll do very well," Mr. Quincel replied.  "Don't you forget
now," he concluded, Drouet showing signs of restlessness; "some young
woman to take the part of Laura."

"Sure, I'll attend to it."

He moved away, forgetting almost all about it the moment Mr. Quincel
had ceased talking.  He had not even thought to ask the time or place.

Drouet was reminded of his promise a day or two later by the receipt of
a letter announcing that the first rehearsal was set for the following
Friday evening, and urging him to kindly forward the young lady's
address at once, in order that the part might be delivered to her.

"Now, who the deuce do I know?" asked the drummer reflectively,
scratching his rosy ear.  "I don't know any one that knows anything
about amateur theatricals."

He went over in memory the names of a number of women he knew, and
finally fixed on one, largely because of the convenient location of her
home on the West Side, and promised himself that as he came out that
evening he would see her.  When, however, he started west on the car he
forgot, and was only reminded of his delinquency by an item in the
"Evening News"--a small three-line affair under the head of Secret
Society Notes--which stated the Custer Lodge of the Order of Elks would
give a theatrical performance in Avery Hall on the 16th, when "Under
the Gaslight" would be produced.

"George!" exclaimed Drouet, "I forgot that."

"What?" inquired Carrie.

They were at their little table in the room which might have been used
for a kitchen, where Carrie occasionally served a meal.  Tonight the
fancy had caught her, and the little table was spread with a pleasing
repast.

"Why, my lodge entertainment.  They're going to give a play, and they
wanted me to get them some young lady to take a part."

"What is it they're going to play?"

"'Under the Gaslight.'"

"When?"

"On the 16th."

"Well, why don't you?" asked Carrie.

"I don't know any one," he replied.

Suddenly he looked up.

"Say," he said, "how would you like to take the part?"

"Me?" said Carrie.  "I can't act."

"How do you know?" questioned Drouet reflectively.

"Because," answered Carrie, "I never did."

Nevertheless, she was pleased to think he would ask.  Her eyes
brightened, for if there was anything that enlisted her sympathies it
was the art of the stage. True to his nature, Drouet clung to this idea
as an easy way out.

"That's nothing.  You can act all you have to down there."

"No, I can't," said Carrie weakly, very much drawn toward the
proposition and yet fearful.

"Yes, you can.  Now, why don't you do it? They need some one, and it
will be lots of fun for you."

"Oh, no, it won't," said Carrie seriously.

"You'd like that.  I know you would.  I've seen you dancing around here
and giving imitations and that's why I asked you. You're clever enough,
all right."

"No, I'm not," said Carrie shyly.

"Now, I'll tell you what you do.  You go down and see about it. It'll
be fun for you.  The rest of the company isn't going to be any good.
They haven't any experience.  What do they know about theatricals?"

He frowned as he thought of their ignorance.

"Hand me the coffee," he added.

"I don't believe I could act, Charlie," Carrie went on pettishly. "You
don't think I could, do you?"

"Sure.  Out o' sight.  I bet you make a hit.  Now you want to go, I
know you do.  I knew it when I came home.  That's why I asked you."

"What is the play, did you say?"

"'Under the Gaslight.'"

"What part would they want me to take?"

"Oh, one of the heroines--I don't know."

"What sort of a play is it?"

"Well," said Drouet, whose memory for such things was not the best,
"it's about a girl who gets kidnapped by a couple of crooks--a man and
a woman that live in the slums.  She had some money or something and
they wanted to get it.  I don't know now how it did go exactly."

"Don't you know what part I would have to take?"

"No, I don't, to tell the truth." He thought a moment.  "Yes, I do,
too.  Laura, that's the thing--you're to be Laura."

"And you can't remember what the part is like?"

"To save me, Cad, I can't," he answered.  "I ought to, too; I've seen
the play enough.  There's a girl in it that was stolen when she was an
infant--was picked off the street or something--and she's the one
that's hounded by the two old criminals I was telling you about." He
stopped with a mouthful of pie poised on a fork before his face.  "She
comes very near getting drowned--no, that's not it.  I'll tell you what
I'll do," he concluded hopelessly, "I'll get you the book.  I can't
remember now for the life of me."

"Well, I don't know," said Carrie, when he had concluded, her interest
and desire to shine dramatically struggling with her timidity for the
mastery.  "I might go if you thought I'd do all right."

"Of course, you'll do," said Drouet, who, in his efforts to enthuse
Carrie, had interested himself.  "Do you think I'd come home here and
urge you to do something that I didn't think you would make a success
of? You can act all right.  It'll be good for you."

"When must I go?" said Carrie, reflectively.

"The first rehearsal is Friday night.  I'll get the part for you to-
night."

"All right," said Carrie resignedly, "I'll do it, but if I make a
failure now it's your fault."

"You won't fail," assured Drouet.  "Just act as you do around here.  Be
natural.  You're all right.  I've often thought you'd make a corking
good actress."

"Did you really?" asked Carrie.

"That's right," said the drummer.

He little knew as he went out of the door that night what a secret
flame he had kindled in the bosom of the girl he left behind.  Carrie
was possessed of that sympathetic, impressionable nature which, ever in
the most developed form, has been the glory of the drama.  She was
created with that passivity of soul which is always the mirror of the
active world.  She possessed an innate taste for imitation and no small
ability.  Even without practice, she could sometimes restore dramatic
situations she had witnessed by re-creating, before her mirror, the
expressions of the various faces taking part in the scene.  She loved
to modulate her voice after the conventional manner of the distressed
heroine, and repeat such pathetic fragments as appealed most to her
sympathies.  Of late, seeing the airy grace of the ingenue in several
well-constructed plays, she had been moved to secretly imitate it, and
many were the little movements and expressions of the body in which she
indulged from time to time in the privacy of her chamber.  On several
occasions, when Drouet had caught her admiring herself, as he imagined,
in the mirror, she was doing nothing more than recalling some little
grace of the mouth or the eyes which she had witnessed in another.
Under his airy accusation she mistook this for vanity and accepted the
blame with a faint sense of error, though, as a matter of fact, it was
nothing more than the first subtle outcroppings of an artistic nature,
endeavoring to re-create the perfect likeness of some phase of beauty
which appealed to her. In such feeble tendencies, be it known, such
outworking of desire to reproduce life, lies the basis of all dramatic
art.

Now, when Carrie heard Drouet's laudatory opinion of her dramatic
ability, her body tingled with satisfaction.  Like the flame which
welds the loosened particles into a solid mass, his words united those
floating wisps of feeling which she had felt, but never believed,
concerning her possible ability, and made them into a gaudy shred of
hope.  Like all human beings, she had a touch of vanity.  She felt that
she could do things if she only had a chance.  How often had she looked
at the well-dressed actresses on the stage and wondered how she would
look, how delightful she would feel if only she were in their place.
The glamour, the tense situation, the fine clothes, the applause, these
had lured her until she felt that she, too, could act--that she, too,
could compel acknowledgment of power.  Now she was told that she really
could--that little things she had done about the house had made even
him feel her power.  It was a delightful sensation while it lasted.

When Drouet was gone, she sat down in her rocking-chair by the window
to think about it.  As usual, imagination exaggerated the possibilities
for her.  It was as if he had put fifty cents in her hand and she had
exercised the thoughts of a thousand dollars.  She saw herself in a
score of pathetic situations in which she assumed a tremulous voice and
suffering manner.  Her mind delighted itself with scenes of luxury and
refinement, situations in which she was the cynosure of all eyes, the
arbiter of all fates.  As she rocked to and fro she felt the tensity of
woe in abandonment, the magnificence of wrath after deception, the
languor of sorrow after defeat.  Thoughts of all the charming women she
had seen in plays--every fancy, every illusion which she had concerning
the stage--now came back as a returning tide after the ebb.  She built
up feelings and a determination which the occasion did not warrant.

Drouet dropped in at the lodge when he went down town, and swashed
around with a great AIR, as Quincel met him.

"Where is that young lady you were going to get for us?" asked the
latter.

"I've got her," said Drouet.

"Have you?" said Quincel, rather surprised by his promptness; "that's
good.  What's her address?" and he pulled out his notebook in order to
be able to send her part to her.

"You want to send her her part?" asked the drummer.

"Yes."

"Well, I'll take it.  I'm going right by her house in the morning.

"What did you say her address was? We only want it in case we have any
information to send her."

"Twenty-nine Ogden Place."

"And her name?"

"Carrie Madenda," said the drummer, firing at random.  The lodge
members knew him to be single.

"That sounds like somebody that can act, doesn't it?" said Quincel.

"Yes, it does."

He took the part home to Carrie and handed it to her with the manner of
one who does a favor.

"He says that's the best part.  Do you think you can do it?"

"I don't know until I look it over.  You know I'm afraid, now that I've
said I would."

"Oh, go on.  What have you got to be afraid of? It's a cheap company.
The rest of them aren't as good as you are."

"Well, I'll see," said Carrie, pleased to have the part, for all her
misgivings.

He sidled around, dressing and fidgeting before he arranged to make his
next remark.

"They were getting ready to print the programs," he said, "and I gave
them the name of Carrie Madenda.  Was that all right?"

"Yes, I guess so," said his companion, looking up at him.  She was
thinking it was slightly strange.

"If you didn't make a hit, you know," he went on.

"Oh, yes," she answered, rather pleased now with his caution.  It was
clever for Drouet.

"I didn't want to introduce you as my wife, because you'd feel worse
then if you didn't GO.  They all know me so well.  But you'll GO all
right.  Anyhow, you'll probably never meet any of them again."

"Oh, I don't care," said Carrie desperately.  She was determined now to
have a try at the fascinating game.

Drouet breathed a sigh of relief.  He had been afraid that he was about
to precipitate another conversation upon the marriage question.

The part of Laura, as Carrie found out when she began to examine it,
was one of suffering and tears.  As delineated by Mr. Daly, it was true
to the most sacred traditions of melodrama as he found it when he began
his career.  The sorrowful demeanor, the tremolo music, the long,
explanatory, cumulative addresses, all were there.

"Poor fellow," read Carrie, consulting the text and drawing her voice
out pathetically.  "Martin, be sure and give him a glass of wine before
he goes."

She was surprised at the briefness of the entire part, not knowing that
she must be on the stage while others were talking, and not only be
there, but also keep herself in harmony with the dramatic movement of
the scenes.

"I think I can do that, though," she concluded.

When Drouet came the next night, she was very much satisfied with her
day's study.

"Well, how goes it, Caddie?" he said.

"All right," she laughed.  "I think I have it memorized nearly."

"That's good," he said.  "Let's hear some of it."

"Oh, I don't know whether I can get up and say it off here," she said
bashfully.

"Well, I don't know why you shouldn't.  It'll be easier here than it
will there."

"I don't know about that," she answered. Eventually she took off the
ballroom episode with considerable feeling, forgetting, as she got
deeper in the scene, all about Drouet, and letting herself rise to a
fine state of feeling.

"Good," said Drouet; "fine, out o' sight! You're all right Caddie, I
tell you."

He was really moved by her excellent representation and the general
appearance of the pathetic little figure as it swayed and finally
fainted to the floor.  He had bounded up to catch her, and now held her
laughing in his arms.

"Ain't you afraid you'll hurt yourself?" he asked.

"Not a bit."

"Well, you're a wonder.  Say, I never knew you could do anything like
that."

"I never did, either," said Carrie merrily, her face flushed with
delight.

"Well, you can bet that you're all right," said Drouet.  "You can take
my word for that.  You won't fail."




Chapter XVII
A GLIMPSE THROUGH THE GATEWAY--HOPE LIGHTENS THE EYE

 The, to Carrie, very important theatrical performance was to take
place at the Avery on conditions which were to make it more noteworthy
than was at first anticipated.  The little dramatic student had written
to Hurstwood the very morning her part was brought her that she was
going to take part in a play.

"I really am," she wrote, feeling that he might take it as a jest; "I
have my part now, honest, truly."

Hurstwood smiled in an indulgent way as he read this.

"I wonder what it is going to be? I must see that."

He answered at once, making a pleasant reference to her ability. "I
haven't the slightest doubt you will make a success.  You must come to
the park to-morrow morning and tell me all about it."

Carrie gladly complied, and revealed all the details of the undertaking
as she understood it.

"Well," he said, "that's fine.  I'm glad to hear it.  Of course, you
will do well, you're so clever."

He had truly never seen so much spirit in the girl before.  Her
tendency to discover a touch of sadness had for the nonce disappeared.
As she spoke her eyes were bright, her cheeks red. She radiated much of
the pleasure which her undertakings gave her.  For all her misgivings--
and they were as plentiful as the moments of the day--she was still
happy.  She could not repress her delight in doing this little thing
which, to an ordinary observer, had no importance at all.

Hurstwood was charmed by the development of the fact that the girl had
capabilities.  There is nothing so inspiring in life as the sight of a
legitimate ambition, no matter how incipient.  It gives color, force,
and beauty to the possessor.

Carrie was now lightened by a touch of this divine afflatus.  She drew
to herself commendation from her two admirers which she had not earned.
Their affection for her naturally heightened their perception of what
she was trying to do and their approval of what she did.  Her
inexperience conserved her own exuberant fancy, which ran riot with
every straw of opportunity, making of it a golden divining rod whereby
the treasure of life was to be discovered.

"Let's see," said Hurstwood, "I ought to know some of the boys in the
lodge.  I'm an Elk myself."

"Oh, you mustn't let him know I told you."

"That's so," said the manager.

"I'd like for you to be there, if you want to come, but I don't see how
you can unless he asks you."

"I'll be there," said Hurstwood affectionately.  "I can fix it so he
won't know you told me.  You leave it to me."

This interest of the manager was a large thing in itself for the
performance, for his standing among the Elks was something worth
talking about.  Already he was thinking of a box with some friends, and
flowers for Carrie.  He would make it a dress-suit affair and give the
little girl a chance.

Within a day or two, Drouet dropped into the Adams Street resort, and
he was at once spied by Hurstwood.  It was at five in the afternoon and
the place was crowded with merchants, actors, managers, politicians, a
goodly company of rotund, rosy figures, silk-hatted, starchy-bosomed,
beringed and bescarfpinned to the queen's taste.  John L. Sullivan, the
pugilist, was at one end of the glittering bar, surrounded by a company
of loudly dressed sports, who were holding a most animated
conversation.  Drouet came across the floor with a festive stride, a
new pair of tan shoes squeaking audibly at his progress.

"Well, sir," said Hurstwood, "I was wondering what had become of you.
I thought you had gone out of town again."

Drouet laughed.

"If you don't report more regularly we'll have to cut you off the
list."

"Couldn't help it," said the drummer, "I've been busy."

They strolled over toward the bar amid the noisy, shifting company of
notables.  The dressy manager was shaken by the hand three times in as
many minutes.

"I hear your lodge is going to give a performance," observed Hurstwood,
in the most offhand manner.

"Yes, who told you?"

"No one," said Hurstwood.  "They just sent me a couple of tickets,
which I can have for two dollars.  Is it going to be any good?"

"I don't know," replied the drummer.  "They've been trying to get me to
get some woman to take a part."

"I wasn't intending to go," said the manager easily.  "I'll subscribe,
of course.  How are things over there?"

"All right.  They're going to fit things up out of the proceeds."

"Well," said the manager, "I hope they make a success of it. Have
another?"

He did not intend to say any more.  Now, if he should appear on the
scene with a few friends, he could say that he had been urged to come
along.  Drouet had a desire to wipe out the possibility of confusion.

"I think the girl is going to take a part in it," he said abruptly,
after thinking it over.

"You don't say so! How did that happen?"

"Well, they were short and wanted me to find them some one.  I told
Carrie, and she seems to want to try."

"Good for her," said the manager.  "It'll be a real nice affair. Do her
good, too.  Has she ever had any experience?"

"Not a bit."

"Oh, well, it isn't anything very serious."

"She's clever, though," said Drouet, casting off any imputation against
Carrie's ability.  "She picks up her part quick enough."

"You don't say so!" said the manager.

"Yes, sir; she surprised me the other night.  By George, if she
didn't."

"We must give her a nice little send-off," said the manager. "I'll look
after the flowers."

Drouet smiled at his good-nature.

"After the show you must come with me and we'll have a little supper."

"I think she'll do all right," said Drouet.

"I want to see her.  She's got to do all right.  We'll make her," and
the manager gave one of his quick, steely half-smiles, which was a
compound of good-nature and shrewdness.

Carrie, meanwhile, attended the first rehearsal.  At this performance
Mr. Quincel presided, aided by Mr. Millice, a young man who had some
qualifications of past experience, which were not exactly understood by
any one.  He was so experienced and so business-like, however, that he
came very near being rude-failing to remember, as he did, that the
individuals he was trying to instruct were volunteer players and not
salaried underlings.

"Now, Miss Madenda," he said, addressing Carrie, who stood in one part
uncertain as to what move to make, "you don't want to stand like that.
Put expression in your face.  Remember, you are troubled over the
intrusion of the stranger.  Walk so," and he struck out across the
Avery stage in almost drooping manner.

Carrie did not exactly fancy the suggestion, but the novelty of the
situation, the presence of strangers, all more or less nervous, and the
desire to do anything rather than make a failure, made her timid.  She
walked in imitation of her mentor as requested, inwardly feeling that
there was something strangely lacking.

"Now, Mrs. Morgan," said the director to one young married woman who
was to take the part of Pearl, "you sit here.  Now, Mr. Bamberger, you
stand here, so.  Now, what is it you say?"

"Explain," said Mr. Bamberger feebly.  He had the part of Ray, Laura's
lover, the society individual who was to waver in his thoughts of
marrying her, upon finding that she was a waif and a nobody by birth.

"How is that--what does your text say?"

"Explain," repeated Mr. Bamberger, looking intently at his part.

"Yes, but it also says," the director remarked, "that you are to look
shocked.  Now, say it again, and see if you can't look shocked."

"Explain!" demanded Mr. Bamberger vigorously.

"No, no, that won't do! Say it this way--EXPLAIN."

"Explain," said Mr. Bamberger, giving a modified imitation.

"That's better.  Now go on."

"One night," resumed Mrs. Morgan, whose lines came next, "father and
mother were going to the opera.  When they were crossing Broadway, the
usual crowd of children accosted them for alms--"

"Hold on," said the director, rushing forward, his arm extended. "Put
more feeling into what you are saying."

Mrs. Morgan looked at him as if she feared a personal assault. Her eye
lightened with resentment.

"Remember, Mrs. Morgan," he added, ignoring the gleam, but modifying
his manner, "that you're detailing a pathetic story. You are now
supposed to be telling something that is a grief to you.  It requires
feeling, repression, thus: 'The usual crowd of children accosted them
for alms.'"

"All right," said Mrs. Morgan.

"Now, go on."

"As mother felt in her pocket for some change, her fingers touched a
cold and trembling hand which had clutched her purse."

"Very good," interrupted the director, nodding his head significantly.

"A pickpocket! Well!" exclaimed Mr. Bamberger, speaking the lines that
here fell to him.

"No, no, Mr. Bamberger," said the director, approaching, "not that way.
'A pickpocket--well?' so.  That's the idea."

"Don't you think," said Carrie weakly, noticing that it had not been
proved yet whether the members of the company knew their lines, let
alone the details of expression, "that it would be better if we just
went through our lines once to see if we know them? We might pick up
some points."

"A very good idea, Miss Madenda," said Mr. Quincel, who sat at the side
of the stage, looking serenely on and volunteering opinions which the
director did not heed.

"All right," said the latter, somewhat abashed, "it might be well to do
it." Then brightening, with a show of authority, "Suppose we run right
through, putting in as much expression as we can."

"Good," said Mr. Quincel.

"This hand," resumed Mrs. Morgan, glancing up at Mr. Bamberger and down
at her book, as the lines proceeded, "my mother grasped in her own, and
so tight that a small, feeble voice uttered an exclamation of pain.
Mother looked down, and there beside her was a little ragged girl."

"Very good," observed the director, now hopelessly idle.

"The thief!" exclaimed Mr. Bamberger.

"Louder," put in the director, finding it almost impossible to keep his
hands off.

"The thief!" roared poor Bamberger.

"Yes, but a thief hardly six years old, with a face like an angel's.
'Stop,' said my mother.  'What are you doing?'

"'Trying to steal,' said the child.

"'Don't you know that it is wicked to do so?' asked my father.

"'No,' said the girl, 'but it is dreadful to be hungry.'

"'Who told you to steal?' asked my mother.

"'She--there,' said the child, pointing to a squalid woman in a doorway
opposite, who fled suddenly down the street.  'That is old Judas,' said
the girl."

Mrs. Morgan read this rather flatly, and the director was in despair.
He fidgeted around, and then went over to Mr. Quincel.

"What do you think of them?" he asked.

"Oh, I guess we'll be able to whip them into shape," said the latter,
with an air of strength under difficulties.

"I don't know," said the director.  "That fellow Bamberger strikes me
as being a pretty poor shift for a lover."

"He's all we've got," said Quincel, rolling up his eyes. "Harrison went
back on me at the last minute.  Who else can we get?"

"I don't know," said the director.  "I'm afraid he'll never pick up."

At this moment Bamberger was exclaiming, "Pearl, you are joking with
me." "Look at that now," said the director, whispering behind his hand.
"My Lord! what can you do with a man who drawls out a sentence like
that?"

"Do the best you can," said Quincel consolingly.

The rendition ran on in this wise until it came to where Carrie, as
Laura, comes into the room to explain to Ray, who, after hearing
Pearl's statement about her birth, had written the letter repudiating
her, which, however, he did not deliver.  Bamberger was just concluding
the words of Ray, "I must go before she returns.  Her step! Too late,"
and was cramming the letter in his pocket, when she began sweetly with:

"Ray!"

"Miss--Miss Courtland," Bamberger faltered weakly.

Carrie looked at him a moment and forgot all about the company present.
She began to feel the part, and summoned an indifferent smile to her
lips, turning as the lines directed and going to a window, as if he
were not present.  She did it with a grace which was fascinating to
look upon.

"Who is that woman?" asked the director, watching Carrie in her little
scene with Bamberger.

"Miss Madenda," said Quincel.

"I know her name," said the director, "but what does she do?"

"I don't know," said Quincel.  "She's a friend of one of our members."

"Well, she's got more gumption than any one I've seen here so far--
seems to take an interest in what she's doing."

"Pretty, too, isn't she?" said Quincel.

The director strolled away without answering.

In the second scene, where she was supposed to face the company in the
ball-room, she did even better, winning the smile of the director, who
volunteered, because of her fascination for him, to come over and speak
with her.

"Were you ever on the stage?" he asked insinuatingly.

"No," said Carrie.

"You do so well, I thought you might have had some experience."

Carrie only smiled consciously.

He walked away to listen to Bamberger, who was feebly spouting some
ardent line.

Mrs. Morgan saw the drift of things and gleamed at Carrie with envious
and snapping black eyes.

"She's some cheap professional," she gave herself the satisfaction of
thinking, and scorned and hated her accordingly.

The rehearsal ended for one day, and Carrie went home feeling that she
had acquitted herself satisfactorily.  The words of the director were
ringing in her ears, and she longed for an opportunity to tell
Hurstwood.  She wanted him to know just how well she was doing.
Drouet, too, was an object for her confidences.  She could hardly wait
until he should ask her, and yet she did not have the vanity to bring
it up.  The drummer, however, had another line of thought to-night, and
her little experience did not appeal to him as important.  He let the
conversation drop, save for what she chose to recite without
solicitation, and Carrie was not good at that.  He took it for granted
that she was doing very well and he was relieved of further worry.
Consequently he threw Carrie into repression, which was irritating.
She felt his indifference keenly and longed to see Hurstwood.  It was
as if he were now the only friend she had on earth.  The next morning
Drouet was interested again, but the damage had been done.

She got a pretty letter from the manager, saying that by the time she
got it he would be waiting for her in the park.  When she came, he
shone upon her as the morning sun.

"Well, my dear," he asked, "how did you come out?"

"Well enough," she said, still somewhat reduced after Drouet.

"Now, tell me just what you did.  Was it pleasant?"

Carrie related the incidents of the rehearsal, warming up as she
proceeded.

"Well, that's delightful," said Hurstwood.  "I'm so glad.  I must get
over there to see you.  When is the next rehearsal?"

"Tuesday," said Carrie, "but they don't allow visitors."

"I imagine I could get in," said Hurstwood significantly.

She was completely restored and delighted by his consideration, but she
made him promise not to come around.

"Now, you must do your best to please me," he said encouragingly. "Just
remember that I want you to succeed.  We will make the performance
worth while.  You do that now."

"I'll try," said Carrie, brimming with affection and enthusiasm.

"That's the girl," said Hurstwood fondly.  "Now, remember," shaking an
affectionate finger at her, "your best."

"I will," she answered, looking back.

The whole earth was brimming sunshine that morning.  She tripped along,
the clear sky pouring liquid blue into her soul.  Oh, blessed are the
children of endeavor in this, that they try and are hopeful.  And
blessed also are they who, knowing, smile and approve.




Chapter XVIII
JUST OVER THE BORDER--A HAIL AND FAREWELL

 By the evening of the 16th the subtle hand of Hurstwood had made
itself apparent.  He had given the word among his friends--and they
were many and influential--that here was something which they ought to
attend, and, as a consequence, the sale of tickets by Mr. Quincel,
acting for the lodge, had been large.  Small four-line notes had
appeared in all of the daily newspapers. These he had arranged for by
the aid of one of his newspaper friends on the "Times," Mr. Harry
McGarren, the managing editor.

"Say, Harry," Hurstwood said to him one evening, as the latter stood at
the bar drinking before wending his belated way homeward, "you can help
the boys out, I guess."

"What is it?" said McGarren, pleased to be consulted by the opulent
manager.

"The Custer Lodge is getting up a little entertainment for their own
good, and they'd like a little newspaper notice.  You know what I mean-
-a squib or two saying that it's going to take place."

"Certainly," said McGarren, "I can fix that for you, George."

At the same time Hurstwood kept himself wholly in the background. The
members of Custer Lodge could scarcely understand why their little
affair was taking so well.  Mr. Harry Quincel was looked upon as quite
a star for this sort of work.

By the time the 16th had arrived Hurstwood's friends had rallied like
Romans to a senator's call.  A well-dressed, good-natured,
flatteringly-inclined audience was assured from the moment he thought
of assisting Carrie.

That little student had mastered her part to her own satisfaction, much
as she trembled for her fate when she should once face the gathered
throng, behind the glare of the footlights.  She tried to console
herself with the thought that a score of other persons, men and women,
were equally tremulous concerning the outcome of their efforts, but she
could not disassociate the general danger from her own individual
liability.  She feared that she would forget her lines, that she might
be unable to master the feeling which she now felt concerning her own
movements in the play.  At times she wished that she had never gone
into the affair; at others, she trembled lest she should be paralyzed
with fear and stand white and gasping, not knowing what to say and
spoiling the entire performance.

In the matter of the company, Mr. Bamberger had disappeared. That
hopeless example had fallen under the lance of the director's
criticism.  Mrs. Morgan was still present, but envious and determined,
if for nothing more than spite, to do as well as Carrie at least.  A
loafing professional had been called in to assume the role of Ray, and,
while he was a poor stick of his kind, he was not troubled by any of
those qualms which attack the spirit of those who have never faced an
audience.  He swashed about (cautioned though he was to maintain
silence concerning his past theatrical relationships) in such a self-
confident manner that he was like to convince every one of his identity
by mere matter of circumstantial evidence.

"It is so easy," he said to Mrs. Morgan, in the usual affected stage
voice.  "An audience would be the last thing to trouble me. It's the
spirit of the part, you know, that is difficult."

Carrie disliked his appearance, but she was too much the actress not to
swallow his qualities with complaisance, seeing that she must suffer
his fictitious love for the evening.

At six she was ready to go.  Theatrical paraphernalia had been provided
over and above her care.  She had practiced her make-up in the morning,
had rehearsed and arranged her material for the evening by one o'clock,
and had gone home to have a final look at her part, waiting for the
evening to come.

On this occasion the lodge sent a carriage.  Drouet rode with her as
far as the door, and then went about the neighboring stores, looking
for some good cigars.  The little actress marched nervously into her
dressing-room and began that painfully anticipated matter of make-up
which was to transform her, a simple maiden, to Laura, The Belle of
Society.

The flare of the gas-jets, the open trunks, suggestive of travel and
display, the scattered contents of the make-up box--rouge, pearl
powder, whiting, burnt cork, India ink, pencils for the eye-lids, wigs,
scissors, looking-glasses, drapery--in short, all the nameless
paraphernalia of disguise, have a remarkable atmosphere of their own.
Since her arrival in the city many things had influenced her, but
always in a far-removed manner. This new atmosphere was more friendly.
It was wholly unlike the great brilliant mansions which waved her
coldly away, permitting her only awe and distant wonder.  This took her
by the hand kindly, as one who says, "My dear, come in." It opened for
her as if for its own.  She had wondered at the greatness of the names
upon the bill-boards, the marvel of the long notices in the papers, the
beauty of the dresses upon the stage, the atmosphere of carriages,
flowers, refinement.  Here was no illusion.  Here was an open door to
see all of that.  She had come upon it as one who stumbles upon a
secret passage and, behold, she was in the chamber of diamonds and
delight!

As she dressed with a flutter, in her little stage room, hearing the
voices outside, seeing Mr. Quincel hurrying here and there, noting Mrs.
Morgan and Mrs. Hoagland at their nervous work of preparation, seeing
all the twenty members of the cast moving about and worrying over what
the result would be, she could not help thinking what a delight this
would be if it would endure; how perfect a state, if she could only do
well now, and then some time get a place as a real actress.  The
thought had taken a mighty hold upon her.  It hummed in her ears as the
melody of an old song.

Outside in the little lobby another scene was begin enacted. Without
the interest of Hurstwood, the little hall would probably have been
comfortably filled, for the members of the lodge were moderately
interested in its welfare.  Hurstwood's word, however, had gone the
rounds.  It was to be a full-dress affair.  The four boxes had been
taken.  Dr. Norman McNeill Hale and his wife were to occupy one.  This
was quite a card.  C. R. Walker, dry-goods merchant and possessor of at
least two hundred thousand dollars, had taken another; a well-known
coal merchant had been induced to take the third, and Hurstwood and his
friends the fourth.  Among the latter was Drouet.  The people who were
now pouring here were not celebrities, nor even local notabilities, in
a general sense. They were the lights of a certain circle--the circle
of small fortunes and secret order distinctions.  These gentlemen Elks
knew the standing of one another.  They had regard for the ability
which could amass a small fortune, own a nice home, keep a barouche or
carriage, perhaps, wear fine clothes, and maintain a good mercantile
position.  Naturally, Hurstwood, who was a little above the order of
mind which accepted this standard as perfect, who had shrewdness and
much assumption of dignity, who held an imposing and authoritative
position, and commanded friendship by intuitive tact in handling
people, was quite a figure.  He was more generally known than most
others in the same circle, and was looked upon as some one whose
reserve covered a mine of influence and solid financial prosperity.

To-night he was in his element.  He came with several friends directly
from Rector's in a carriage.  In the lobby he met Drouet, who was just
returning from a trip for more cigars.  All five now joined in an
animated conversation concerning the company present and the general
drift of lodge affairs.

"Who's here?" said Hurstwood, passing into the theatre proper, where
the lights were turned up and a company of gentlemen were laughing and
talking in the open space back of the seats.

"Why, how do you do, Mr. Hurstwood?" came from the first individual
recognized.

"Glad to see you," said the latter, grasping his hand lightly.

"Looks quite an affair, doesn't it?"

"Yes, indeed," said the manager.

"Custer seems to have the backing of its members," observed the friend.

"So it should," said the knowing manager.  "I'm glad to see it."

"Well, George," said another rotund citizen, whose avoirdupois made
necessary an almost alarming display of starched shirt bosom, "how goes
it with you?"

"Excellent," said the manager.

"What brings you over here? You're not a member of Custer."

"Good-nature," returned the manager.  "Like to see the boys, you know."

"Wife here?"

"She couldn't come to-night.  She's not well."

"Sorry to hear it--nothing serious, I hope."

"No, just feeling a little ill."

"I remember Mrs.  Hurstwood when she was traveling once with you over
to St. Joe--" and here the newcomer launched off in a trivial
recollection, which was terminated by the arrival of more friends.

"Why, George, how are you?" said another genial West Side politician
and lodge member.  "My, but I'm glad to see you again; how are things,
anyhow?"

"Very well; I see you got that nomination for alderman."

"Yes, we whipped them out over there without much trouble."

"What do you suppose Hennessy will do now?"

"Oh, he'll go back to his brick business.  He has a brick-yard, you
know."

"I didn't know that," said the manager.  "Felt pretty sore, I suppose,
over his defeat." "Perhaps," said the other, winking shrewdly.

Some of the more favored of his friends whom he had invited began to
roll up in carriages now.  They came shuffling in with a great show of
finery and much evident feeling of content and importance.

"Here we are," said Hurstwood, turning to one from a group with whom he
was talking.

"That's right," returned the newcomer, a gentleman of about forty-five.

"And say," he whispered, jovially, pulling Hurstwood over by the
shoulder so that he might whisper in his ear, "if this isn't a good
show, I'll punch your head."

"You ought to pay for seeing your old friends.  Bother the show!"

To another who inquired, "Is it something really good?" the manager
replied:

"I don't know.  I don't suppose so." Then, lifting his hand graciously,
"For the lodge."

"Lots of boys out, eh?"

"Yes, look up Shanahan.  He was just asking for you a moment ago."

It was thus that the little theatre resounded to a babble of successful
voices, the creak of fine clothes, the commonplace of good-nature, and
all largely because of this man's bidding.  Look at him any time within
the half hour before the curtain was up, he was a member of an eminent
group--a rounded company of five or more whose stout figures, large
white bosoms, and shining pins bespoke the character of their success.
The gentlemen who brought their wives called him out to shake hands.
Seats clicked, ushers bowed while he looked blandly on.  He was
evidently a light among them, reflecting in his personality the
ambitions of those who greeted him.  He was acknowledged, fawned upon,
in a way lionized.  Through it all one could see the standing of the
man.  It was greatness in a way, small as it was.




Chapter XIX
AN HOUR IN ELFLAND--A CLAMOUR HALF HEARD

 At last the curtain was ready to go up.  All the details of the make-
up had been completed, and the company settled down as the leader of
the small, hired orchestra tapped significantly upon his music rack
with his baton and began the soft curtain-raising strain.  Hurstwood
ceased talking, and went with Drouet and his friend Sagar Morrison
around to the box.

"Now, we'll see how the little girl does," he said to Drouet, in a tone
which no one else could hear.

On the stage, six of the characters had already appeared in the opening
parlor scene.  Drouet and Hurstwood saw at a glance that Carrie was not
among them, and went on talking in a whisper. Mrs. Morgan, Mrs.
Hoagland, and the actor who had taken Bamberger's part were
representing the principal roles in this scene.  The professional,
whose name was Patton, had little to recommend him outside of his
assurance, but this at the present moment was most palpably needed.
Mrs. Morgan, as Pearl, was stiff with fright.  Mrs. Hoagland was husky
in the throat.  The whole company was so weak-kneed that the lines were
merely spoken, and nothing more.  It took all the hope and uncritical
good-nature of the audience to keep from manifesting pity by that
unrest which is the agony of failure.

Hurstwood was perfectly indifferent.  He took it for granted that it
would be worthless.  All he cared for was to have it endurable enough
to allow for pretension and congratulation afterward.

After the first rush of fright, however, the players got over the
danger of collapse.  They rambled weakly forward, losing nearly all the
expression which was intended, and making the thing dull in the
extreme, when Carrie came in.

One glance at her, and both Hurstwood and Drouet saw plainly that she
also was weak-kneed.  She came faintly across the stage, saying:

"And you, sir; we have been looking for you since eight o'clock," but
with so little color and in such a feeble voice that it was positively
painful.

"She's frightened," whispered Drouet to Hurstwood.

The manager made no answer.

She had a line presently which was supposed to be funny.

"Well, that's as much as to say that I'm a sort of life pill."

It came out so flat, however, that it was a deathly thing. Drouet
fidgeted.  Hurstwood moved his toe the least bit.

There was another place in which Laura was to rise and, with a sense of
impending disaster, say, sadly:

"I wish you hadn't said that, Pearl.  You know the old proverb, 'Call a
maid by a married name.'"

The lack of feeling in the thing was ridiculous.  Carrie did not get it
at all.  She seemed to be talking in her sleep.  It looked as if she
were certain to be a wretched failure.  She was more hopeless than Mrs.
Morgan, who had recovered somewhat, and was now saying her lines
clearly at least.  Drouet looked away from the stage at the audience.
The latter held out silently, hoping for a general change, of course.
Hurstwood fixed his eye on Carrie, as if to hypnotize her into doing
better.  He was pouring determination of his own in her direction.  He
felt sorry for her.

In a few more minutes it fell to her to read the letter sent in by the
strange villain.  The audience had been slightly diverted by a
conversation between the professional actor and a character called
Snorky, impersonated by a short little American, who really developed
some humor as a half-crazed, one-armed soldier, turned messenger for a
living.  He bawled his lines out with such defiance that, while they
really did not partake of the humor intended, they were funny.  Now he
was off, however, and it was back to pathos, with Carrie as the chief
figure.  She did not recover.  She wandered through the whole scene
between herself and the intruding villain, straining the patience of
the audience, and finally exiting, much to their relief.

"She's too nervous," said Drouet, feeling in the mildness of the remark
that he was lying for once.

"Better go back and say a word to her."

Drouet was glad to do anything for relief.  He fairly hustled around to
the side entrance, and was let in by the friendly doorkeeper.  Carrie
was standing in the wings, weakly waiting her next cue, all the snap
and nerve gone out of her.

"Say, Cad," he said, looking at her, "you mustn't be nervous. Wake up.
Those guys out there don't amount to anything.  What are you afraid
of?"

"I don't know," said Carrie.  "I just don't seem to be able to do it."

She was grateful for the drummer's presence, though.  She had found the
company so nervous that her own strength had gone.

"Come on," said Drouet.  "Brace up.  What are you afraid of? Go on out
there now, and do the trick.  What do you care?"

Carrie revived a little under the drummer's electrical, nervous
condition.

"Did I do so very bad?"

"Not a bit.  All you need is a little more ginger.  Do it as you showed
me.  Get that toss of your head you had the other night."

Carrie remembered her triumph in the room.  She tried to think she
could to it.

'What's next?" he said, looking at her part, which she had been
studying.

"Why, the scene between Ray and me when I refuse him."

"Well, now you do that lively," said the drummer.  "Put in snap, that's
the thing.  Act as if you didn't care."

"Your turn next, Miss Madenda," said the prompter.

"Oh, dear," said Carrie.

"Well, you're a chump for being afraid," said Drouet.  "Come on now,
brace up.  I'll watch you from right here."

"Will you?" said Carrie.

"Yes, now go on.  Don't be afraid."

The prompter signaled her.

She started out, weak as ever, but suddenly her nerve partially
returned.  She thought of Drouet looking.

"Ray," she said, gently, using a tone of voice much more calm than when
she had last appeared.  It was the scene which had pleased the director
at the rehearsal.

"She's easier," thought Hurstwood to himself.

She did not do the part as she had at rehearsal, but she was better.
The audience was at least not irritated.  The improvement of the work
of the entire company took away direct observation from her.  They were
making very fair progress, and now it looked as if the play would be
passable, in the less trying parts at least.

Carrie came off warm and nervous.

"Well," she said, looking at him, "was it any better?"

"Well, I should say so.  That's the way.  Put life into it.  You did
that about a thousand per cent.  better than you did the other scene.
Now go on and fire up.  You can do it.  Knock 'em."

"Was it really better?"

"Better, I should say so.  What comes next?"

"That ballroom scene."

"Well, you can do that all right," he said.

"I don't know," answered Carrie.

"Why, woman," he exclaimed, "you did it for me! Now you go out there
and do it.  It'll be fun for you.  Just do as you did in the room.  If
you'll reel it off that way, I'll bet you make a hit.  Now, what'll you
bet? You do it."

The drummer usually allowed his ardent good-nature to get the better of
his speech.  He really did think that Carrie had acted this particular
scene very well, and he wanted her to repeat it in public.  His
enthusiasm was due to the mere spirit of the occasion.

When the time came, he buoyed Carrie up most effectually.  He began to
make her feel as if she had done very well.  The old melancholy of
desire began to come back as he talked at her, and by the time the
situation rolled around she was running high in feeling.

"I think I can do this."

"Sure you can.  Now you go ahead and see."

On the stage, Mrs. Van Dam was making her cruel insinuation against
Laura.

Carrie listened, and caught the infection of something--she did not
know what.  Her nostrils sniffed thinly.

"It means," the professional actor began, speaking as Ray, "that
society is a terrible avenger of insult.  Have you ever heard of the
Siberian wolves? When one of the pack falls through weakness, the
others devour him.  It is not an elegant comparison, but there is
something wolfish in society.  Laura has mocked it with a pretence, and
society, which is made up of pretence, will bitterly resent the
mockery."

At the sound of her stage name Carrie started.  She began to feel the
bitterness of the situation.  The feelings of the outcast descended
upon her.  She hung at the wing's edge, wrapped in her own mounting
thoughts.  She hardly heard anything more, save her own rumbling blood.

"Come, girls," said Mrs. Van Dam, solemnly, "let us look after our
things.  They are no longer safe when such an accomplished thief
enters."

"Cue," said the prompter, close to her side, but she did not hear.
Already she was moving forward with a steady grace, born of
inspiration.  She dawned upon the audience, handsome and proud,
shifting, with the necessity of the situation, to a cold, white,
helpless object, as the social pack moved away from her scornfully.

Hurstwood blinked his eyes and caught the infection.  The radiating
waves of feeling and sincerity were already breaking against the
farthest walls of the chamber.  The magic of passion, which will yet
dissolve the world, was here at work.

There was a drawing, too, of attention, a riveting of feeling,
heretofore wandering.

"Ray! Ray! Why do you not come back to her?" was the cry of Pearl.

Every eye was fixed on Carrie, still proud and scornful.  They moved as
she moved.  Their eyes were with her eyes.

Mrs. Morgan, as Pearl, approached her.

"Let us go home," she said.

"No," answered Carrie, her voice assuming for the first time a
penetrating quality which it had never known.  "Stay with him!"

She pointed an almost accusing hand toward her lover.  Then, with a
pathos which struck home because of its utter simplicity, "He shall not
suffer long."

Hurstwood realized that he was seeing something extraordinarily good.
It was heightened for him by the applause of the audience as the
curtain descended and the fact that it was Carrie.  He thought now that
she was beautiful.  She had done something which was above his sphere.
He felt a keen delight in realizing that she was his.

"Fine," he said, and then, seized by a sudden impulse, arose and went
about to the stage door.

When he came in upon Carrie she was still with Drouet.  His feelings
for her were most exuberant.  He was almost swept away by the strength
and feeling she exhibited.  His desire was to pour forth his praise
with the unbounded feelings of a lover, but here was Drouet, whose
affection was also rapidly reviving.  The latter was more fascinated,
if anything, than Hurstwood.  At least, in the nature of things, it
took a more ruddy form.

"Well, well," said Drouet, "you did out of sight.  That was simply
great.  I knew you could do it.  Oh, but you're a little daisy!"

Carrie's eyes flamed with the light of achievement.

"Did I do all right?"

"Did you? Well, I guess.  Didn't you hear the applause?"

There was some faint sound of clapping yet.

"I thought I got it something like--I felt it."

Just then Hurstwood came in.  Instinctively he felt the change in
Drouet.  He saw that the drummer was near to Carrie, and jealousy
leaped alight in his bosom.  In a flash of thought, he reproached
himself for having sent him back.  Also, he hated him as an intruder.
He could scarcely pull himself down to the level where he would have to
congratulate Carrie as a friend.  Nevertheless, the man mastered
himself, and it was a triumph.  He almost jerked the old subtle light
to his eyes.

"I thought," he said, looking at Carrie, "I would come around and tell
you how well you did, Mrs. Drouet.  It was delightful."

Carrie took the cue, and replied:

"Oh, thank you."

"I was just telling her," put in Drouet, now delighted with his
possession, "that I thought she did fine."

"Indeed you did," said Hurstwood, turning upon Carrie eyes in which she
read more than the words.

Carrie laughed luxuriantly.

"If you do as well in the rest of the play, you will make us all think
you are a born actress."

Carrie smiled again.  She felt the acuteness of Hurstwood's position,
and wished deeply that she could be alone with him, but she did not
understand the change in Drouet.  Hurstwood found that he could not
talk, repressed as he was, and grudging Drouet every moment of his
presence, he bowed himself out with the elegance of a Faust.  Outside
he set his teeth with envy.

"Damn it!" he said, "is he always going to be in the way?" He was moody
when he got back to the box, and could not talk for thinking of his
wretched situation.

As the curtain for the next act arose, Drouet came back.  He was very
much enlivened in temper and inclined to whisper, but Hurstwood
pretended interest.  He fixed his eyes on the stage, although Carrie
was not there, a short bit of melodramatic comedy preceding her
entrance.  He did not see what was going on, however.  He was thinking
his own thoughts, and they were wretched.

The progress of the play did not improve matters for him. Carrie, from
now on, was easily the center of interest.  The audience, which had
been inclined to feel that nothing could be good after the first gloomy
impression, now went to the other extreme and saw power where it was
not.  The general feeling reacted on Carrie.  She presented her part
with some felicity, though nothing like the intensity which had aroused
the feeling at the end of the long first act.

Both Hurstwood and Drouet viewed her pretty figure with rising
feelings.  The fact that such ability should reveal itself in her, that
they should see it set forth under such effective circumstances, framed
almost in massy gold and shone upon by the appropriate lights of
sentiment and personality, heightened her charm for them.  She was more
than the old Carrie to Drouet.  He longed to be at home with her until
he could tell her.  He awaited impatiently the end, when they should go
home alone.

Hurstwood, on the contrary, saw in the strength of her new
attractiveness his miserable predicament.  He could have cursed the man
beside him.  By the Lord, he could not even applaud feelingly as he
would.  For once he must simulate when it left a taste in his mouth.

It was in the last act that Carrie's fascination for her lovers assumed
its most effective character.

Hurstwood listened to its progress, wondering when Carrie would come
on.  He had not long to wait.  The author had used the artifice of
sending all the merry company for a drive, and now Carrie came in
alone.  It was the first time that Hurstwood had had a chance to see
her facing the audience quite alone, for nowhere else had she been
without a foil of some sort.  He suddenly felt, as she entered, that
her old strength--the power that had grasped him at the end of the
first act--had come back. She seemed to be gaining feeling, now that
the play was drawing to a close and the opportunity for great action
was passing.

"Poor Pearl," she said, speaking with natural pathos.  "It is a sad
thing to want for happiness, but it is a terrible thing to see another
groping about blindly for it, when it is almost within the grasp."

She was gazing now sadly out upon the open sea, her arm resting
listlessly upon the polished door-post.

Hurstwood began to feel a deep sympathy for her and for himself. He
could almost feel that she was talking to him.  He was, by a
combination of feelings and entanglements, almost deluded by that
quality of voice and manner which, like a pathetic strain of music,
seems ever a personal and intimate thing.  Pathos has this quality,
that it seems ever addressed to one alone.

"And yet, she can be very happy with him," went on the little actress.
"Her sunny temper, her joyous face will brighten any home."

She turned slowly toward the audience without seeing.  There was so
much simplicity in her movements that she seemed wholly alone. Then she
found a seat by a table, and turned over some books, devoting a thought
to them.

"With no longings for what I may not have," she breathed in conclusion-
-and it was almost a sigh--"my existence hidden from all save two in
the wide world, and making my joy out of the joy of that innocent girl
who will soon be his wife."

Hurstwood was sorry when a character, known as Peach Blossom,
interrupted her.  He stirred irritably, for he wished her to go on.  He
was charmed by the pale face, the lissome figure, draped in pearl gray,
with a coiled string of pearls at the throat. Carrie had the air of one
who was weary and in need of protection, and, under the fascinating
make-believe of the moment, he rose in feeling until he was ready in
spirit to go to her and ease her out of her misery by adding to his own
delight.

In a moment Carrie was alone again, and was saying, with animation:

"I must return to the city, no matter what dangers may lurk here. I
must go, secretly if I can; openly, if I must."

There was a sound of horses' hoofs outside, and then Ray's voice
saying: "No, I shall not ride again.  Put him up."

He entered, and then began a scene which had as much to do with the
creation of the tragedy of affection in Hurstwood as anything in his
peculiar and involved career.  For Carrie had resolved to make
something of this scene, and, now that the cue had come, it began to
take a feeling hold upon her.  Both Hurstwood and Drouet noted the
rising sentiment as she proceeded.

"I thought you had gone with Pearl," she said to her lover.

"I did go part of the way, but I left the Party a mile down the road."

"You and Pearl had no disagreement?"

"No--yes; that is, we always have.  Our social barometers always stand
at 'cloudy' and 'overcast.'"

"And whose fault is that?" she said, easily.

"Not mine," he answered, pettishly.  "I know I do all I can--I say all
I can--but she----"

This was rather awkwardly put by Patton, but Carrie redeemed it with a
grace which was inspiring.

"But she is your wife," she said, fixing her whole attention upon the
stilled actor, and softening the quality of her voice until it was
again low and musical.  "Ray, my friend, courtship is the text from
which the whole sermon of married life takes its theme. Do not let
yours be discontented and unhappy."

She put her two little hands together and pressed them appealingly.

Hurstwood gazed with slightly parted lips.  Drouet was fidgeting with
satisfaction.

"To be my wife, yes," went on the actor in a manner which was weak by
comparison, but which could not now spoil the tender atmosphere which
Carrie had created and maintained.  She did not seem to feel that he
was wretched.  She would have done nearly as well with a block of wood.
The accessories she needed were within her own imagination.  The acting
of others could not affect them.

"And you repent already?" she said, slowly.

"I lost you," he said, seizing her little hand, "and I was at the mercy
of any flirt who chose to give me an inviting look.  It was your fault-
-you know it was--why did you leave me?"

Carrie turned slowly away, and seemed to be mastering some impulse in
silence.  Then she turned back.

"Ray," she said, "the greatest happiness I have ever felt has been the
thought that all your affection was forever bestowed upon a virtuous
woman, your equal in family, fortune, and accomplishments.  What a
revelation do you make to me now! What is it makes you continually war
with your happiness?"

The last question was asked so simply that it came to the audience and
the lover as a personal thing.

At last it came to the part where the lover exclaimed, "Be to me as you
used to be."

Carrie answered, with affecting sweetness, "I cannot be that to you,
but I can speak in the spirit of the Laura who is dead to you forever."

"Be it as you will," said Patton.

Hurstwood leaned forward.  The whole audience was silent and intent.

"Let the woman you look upon be wise or vain," said Carrie, her eyes
bent sadly upon the lover, who had sunk into a seat, "beautiful or
homely, rich or poor, she has but one thing she can really give or
refuse--her heart."

Drouet felt a scratch in his throat.

"Her beauty, her wit, her accomplishments, she may sell to you; but her
love is the treasure without money and without price."

The manager suffered this as a personal appeal.  It came to him as if
they were alone, and he could hardly restrain the tears for sorrow over
the hopeless, pathetic, and yet dainty and appealing woman whom he
loved.  Drouet also was beside himself.  He was resolving that he would
be to Carrie what he had never been before.  He would marry her, by
George! She was worth it.

"She asks only in return," said Carrie, scarcely hearing the small,
scheduled reply of her lover, and putting herself even more in harmony
with the plaintive melody now issuing from the orchestra, "that when
you look upon her your eyes shall speak devotion; that when you address
her your voice shall be gentle, loving, and kind; that you shall not
despise her because she cannot understand all at once your vigorous
thoughts and ambitious designs; for, when misfortune and evil have
defeated your greatest purposes, her love remains to console you.  You
look to the trees," she continued, while Hurstwood restrained his
feelings only by the grimmest repression, "for strength and grandeur;
do not despise the flowers because their fragrance is all they have to
give.  Remember," she concluded, tenderly, "love is all a woman has to
give," and she laid a strange, sweet accent on the all, "but it is the
only thing which God permits us to carry beyond the grave."

The two men were in the most harrowed state of affection.  They
scarcely heard the few remaining words with which the scene concluded.
They only saw their idol, moving about with appealing grace, continuing
a power which to them was a revelation.

Hurstwood resolved a thousands things, Drouet as well.  They joined
equally in the burst of applause which called Carrie out. Drouet
pounded his hands until they ached.  Then he jumped up again and
started out.  As he went, Carrie came out, and, seeing an immense
basket of flowers being hurried down the aisle toward her she waited.
They were Hurstwood's.  She looked toward the manager's box for a
moment, caught his eye, and smiled.  He could have leaped out of the
box to enfold her.  He forgot the need of circumspectness which his
married state enforced.  He almost forgot that he had with him in the
box those who knew him.  By the Lord, he would have that lovely girl if
it took his all.  He would act at once.  This should be the end of
Drouet, and don't you forget it.  He would not wait another day.  The
drummer should not have her.

He was so excited that he could not stay in the box.  He went into the
lobby, and then into the street, thinking.  Drouet did not return.  In
a few minutes the last act was over, and he was crazy to have Carrie
alone.  He cursed the luck that could keep him smiling, bowing,
shamming, when he wanted to tell her that he loved her, when he wanted
to whisper to her alone.  He groaned as he saw that his hopes were
futile.  He must even take her to supper, shamming.  He finally went
about and asked how she was getting along.  The actors were all
dressing, talking, hurrying about.  Drouet was palavering himself with
the looseness of excitement and passion.  The manager mastered himself
only by a great effort.

"We are going to supper, of course," he said, with a voice that was a
mockery of his heart.

"Oh, yes," said Carrie, smiling.

The little actress was in fine feather.  She was realizing now what it
was to be petted.  For once she was the admired, the sought-for.  The
independence of success now made its first faint showing.  With the
tables turned, she was looking down, rather than up, to her lover.  She
did not fully realize that this was so, but there was something in
condescension coming from her which was infinitely sweet.  When she was
ready they climbed into the waiting coach and drove down town; once,
only, did she find an opportunity to express her feeling, and that was
when the manager preceded Drouet in the coach and sat beside her.
Before Drouet was fully in she had squeezed Hurstwood's hand in a
gentle, impulsive manner.  The manager was beside himself with
affection.  He could have sold his soul to be with her alone. "Ah," he
thought, "the agony of it."

Drouet hung on, thinking he was all in all.  The dinner was spoiled by
his enthusiasm.  Hurstwood went home feeling as if he should die if he
did not find affectionate relief.  He whispered "to-morrow"
passionately to Carrie, and she understood.  He walked away from the
drummer and his prize at parting feeling as if he could slay him and
not regret.  Carrie also felt the misery of it.

"Good-night," he said, simulating an easy friendliness.

"Good-night," said the little actress, tenderly.

"The fool!" he said, now hating Drouet.  "The idiot! I'll do him yet,
and that quick! We'll see to-morrow."

"Well, if you aren't a wonder," Drouet was saying, complacently,
squeezing Carrie's arm.  "You are the dandiest little girl on earth."




Chapter XX
THE LURE OF THE SPIRIT--THE FLESH IN PURSUIT

 Passion in a man of Hurstwood's nature takes a vigorous form.  It is
no musing, dreamy thing.  There is none of the tendency to sing outside
of my lady's window--to languish and repine in the face of
difficulties.  In the night he was long getting to sleep because of too
much thinking, and in the morning he was early awake, seizing with
alacrity upon the same dear subject and pursuing it with vigor.  He was
out of sorts physically, as well as disordered mentally, for did he not
delight in a new manner in his Carrie, and was not Drouet in the way?
Never was man more harassed than he by the thoughts of his love being
held by the elated, flush-mannered drummer.  He would have given
anything, it seemed to him, to have the complication ended--to have
Carrie acquiesce to an arrangement which would dispose of Drouet
effectually and forever.

What to do.  He dressed thinking.  He moved about in the same chamber
with his wife, unmindful of her presence.

At breakfast he found himself without an appetite.  The meat to which
he helped himself remained on his plate untouched.  His coffee grew
cold, while he scanned the paper indifferently.  Here and there he read
a little thing, but remembered nothing. Jessica had not yet come down.
His wife sat at one end of the table revolving thoughts of her own in
silence.  A new servant had been recently installed and had forgot the
napkins.  On this account the silence was irritably broken by a
reproof.

"I've told you about this before, Maggie," said Mrs. Hurstwood. "I'm
not going to tell you again."

Hurstwood took a glance at his wife.  She was frowning.  Just now her
manner irritated him excessively.  Her next remark was addressed to
him.

"Have you made up your mind, George, when you will take your vacation?"

It was customary for them to discuss the regular summer outing at this
season of the year.

"Not yet," he said, "I'm very busy just now."

"Well, you'll want to make up your mind pretty soon, won't you, if
we're going?" she returned.

"I guess we have a few days yet," he said.

"Hmff," she returned.  "Don't wait until the season's over."

She stirred in aggravation as she said this.

"There you go again," he observed.  "One would think I never did
anything, the way you begin."

"Well, I want to know about it," she reiterated.

"You've got a few days yet," he insisted.  "You'll not want to start
before the races are over."

He was irritated to think that this should come up when he wished to
have his thoughts for other purposes.

"Well, we may.  Jessica doesn't want to stay until the end of the
races."

"What did you want with a season ticket, then?"

"Uh!" she said, using the sound as an exclamation of disgust, "I'll not
argue with you," and therewith arose to leave the table.

"Say," he said, rising, putting a note of determination in his voice
which caused her to delay her departure, "what's the matter with you of
late? Can't I talk with you any more?"

"Certainly, you can TALK with me," she replied, laying emphasis on the
word.

"Well, you wouldn't think so by the way you act.  Now, you want to know
when I'll be ready--not for a month yet.  Maybe not then."

"We'll go without you."

"You will, eh?" he sneered.

"Yes, we will."

He was astonished at the woman's determination, but it only irritated
him the more.

"Well, we'll see about that.  It seems to me you're trying to run
things with a pretty high hand of late.  You talk as though you settled
my affairs for me.  Well, you don't.  You don't regulate anything
that's connected with me.  If you want to go, go, but you won't hurry
me by any such talk as that."

He was thoroughly aroused now.  His dark eyes snapped, and he crunched
his paper as he laid it down.  Mrs. Hurstwood said nothing more.  He
was just finishing when she turned on her heel and went out into the
hall and upstairs.  He paused for a moment, as if hesitating, then sat
down and drank a little coffee, and thereafter arose and went for his
hat and gloves upon the main floor.

His wife had really not anticipated a row of this character.  She had
come down to the breakfast table feeling a little out of sorts with
herself and revolving a scheme which she had in her mind.  Jessica had
called her attention to the fact that the races were not what they were
supposed to be.  The social opportunities were not what they had
thought they would be this year.  The beautiful girl found going every
day a dull thing. There was an earlier exodus this year of people who
were anybody to the watering places and Europe.  In her own circle of
acquaintances several young men in whom she was interested had gone to
Waukesha.  She began to feel that she would like to go too, and her
mother agreed with her.

Accordingly, Mrs. Hurstwood decided to broach the subject.  She was
thinking this over when she came down to the table, but for some reason
the atmosphere was wrong.  She was not sure, after it was all over,
just how the trouble had begun.  She was determined now, however, that
her husband was a brute, and that, under no circumstances, would she
let this go by unsettled.  She would have more lady-like treatment or
she would know why.

For his part, the manager was loaded with the care of this new argument
until he reached his office and started from there to meet Carrie.
Then the other complications of love, desire, and opposition possessed
him.  His thoughts fled on before him upon eagles' wings.  He could
hardly wait until he should meet Carrie face to face.  What was the
night, after all, without her--what the day? She must and should be
his.

For her part, Carrie had experienced a world of fancy and feeling since
she had left him, the night before.  She had listened to Drouet's
enthusiastic meanderings with much regard for that part which concerned
herself, with very little for that which affected his own gain.  She
kept him at such lengths as she could, because her thoughts were with
her own triumph.  She felt Hurstwood's passion as a delightful
background to her own achievement, and she wondered what he would have
to say.  She was sorry for him, too, with that peculiar sorrow which
finds something complimentary to itself in the misery of another.  She
was now experiencing the first shades of feeling of that subtle change
which removes one out of the ranks of the suppliants into the lines of
the dispensers of charity.  She was, all in all, exceedingly happy.

On the morrow, however, there was nothing in the papers concerning the
event, and, in view of the flow of common, everyday things about, it
now lost a shade of the glow of the previous evening.  Drouet himself
was not talking so much OF as FOR her.  He felt instinctively that, for
some reason or other, he needed reconstruction in her regard.

"I think," he said, as he spruced around their chambers the next
morning, preparatory to going down town, "that I'll straighten out that
little deal of mine this month and then we'll get married.  I was
talking with Mosher about that yesterday."

"No, you won't," said Carrie, who was coming to feel a certain faint
power to jest with the drummer.

"Yes, I will," he exclaimed, more feelingly than usual, adding, with
the tone of one who pleads, "Don't you believe what I've told you?"

Carrie laughed a little.

"Of course I do," she answered.

Drouet's assurance now misgave him.  Shallow as was his mental
observation, there was that in the things which had happened which made
his little power of analysis useless.  Carrie was still with him, but
not helpless and pleading.  There was a lilt in her voice which was
new.  She did not study him with eyes expressive of dependence.  The
drummer was feeling the shadow of something which was coming.  It
colored his feelings and made him develop those little attentions and
say those little words which were mere forefendations against danger.

Shortly afterward he departed, and Carrie prepared for her meeting with
Hurstwood.  She hurried at her toilet, which was soon made, and
hastened down the stairs.  At the corner she passed Drouet, but they
did not see each other.

The drummer had forgotten some bills which he wished to turn into his
house.  He hastened up the stairs and burst into the room, but found
only the chambermaid, who was cleaning up.

"Hello," he exclaimed, half to himself, "has Carrie gone?"

"Your wife? Yes, she went out just a few minutes ago."

"That's strange," thought Drouet.  "She didn't say a word to me. I
wonder where she went?"

He hastened about, rummaging in his valise for what he wanted, and
finally pocketing it.  Then he turned his attention to his fair
neighbor, who was good-looking and kindly disposed towards him.

"What are you up to?" he said, smiling.

"Just cleaning," she replied, stopping and winding a dusting towel
about her hand.

"Tired of it?"

"Not so very."

"Let me show you something," he said, affably, coming over and taking
out of his pocket a little lithographed card which had been issued by a
wholesale tobacco company.  On this was printed a picture of a pretty
girl, holding a striped parasol, the colors of which could be changed
by means of a revolving disk in the back, which showed red, yellow,
green, and blue through little interstices made in the ground occupied
by the umbrella top.

"Isn't that clever?" he said, handing it to her and showing her how it
worked.  "You never saw anything like that before."

"Isn't it nice?" she answered.

"You can have it if you want it," he remarked.

"That's a pretty ring you have," he said, touching a commonplace
setting which adorned the hand holding the card he had given her.

"Do you think so?"

"That's right," he answered, making use of a pretence at examination to
secure her finger.  "That's fine."

The ice being thus broken, he launched into further observation
pretending to forget that her fingers were still retained by his. She
soon withdrew them, however, and retreated a few feet to rest against
the window-sill.

"I didn't see you for a long time," she said, coquettishly, repulsing
one of his exuberant approaches.  "You must have been away."

"I was," said Drouet.

"Do you travel far?"

"Pretty far--yes."

"Do you like it?"

"Oh, not very well.  You get tired of it after a while."

"I wish I could travel," said the girl, gazing idly out of the window.

"What has become of your friend, Mr. Hurstwood?" she suddenly asked,
bethinking herself of the manager, who, from her own observation,
seemed to contain promising material.

"He's here in town.  What makes you ask about him?"

"Oh, nothing, only he hasn't been here since you got back."

"How did you come to know him?"

"Didn't I take up his name a dozen times in the last month?"

"Get out," said the drummer, lightly.  "He hasn't called more than half
a dozen times since we've been here."

"He hasn't, eh?" said the girl, smiling.  "That's all you know about
it."

Drouet took on a slightly more serious tone.  He was uncertain as to
whether she was joking or not.

"Tease," he said, "what makes you smile that way?"

"Oh, nothing."

"Have you seen him recently?"

"Not since you came back," she laughed.

"Before?"

"Certainly."

"How often?"

"Why, nearly every day."

She was a mischievous newsmonger, and was keenly wondering what the
effect of her words would be.

"Who did he come to see?" asked the drummer, incredulously.

"Mrs. Drouet."

He looked rather foolish at this answer, and then attempted to correct
himself so as not to appear a dupe.

"Well," he said, "what of it?"

"Nothing," replied the girl, her head cocked coquettishly on one side.

"He's an old friend," he went on, getting deeper into the mire.

He would have gone on further with his little flirtation, but the taste
for it was temporarily removed.  He was quite relieved when the girl's
named was called from below.

"I've got to go," she said, moving away from him airily.

"I'll see you later," he said, with a pretence of disturbance at being
interrupted.

When she was gone, he gave freer play to his feelings.  His face, never
easily controlled by him, expressed all the perplexity and disturbance
which he felt.  Could it be that Carrie had received so many visits and
yet said nothing about them? Was Hurstwood lying? What did the
chambermaid mean by it, anyway? He had thought there was something odd
about Carrie's manner at the time.  Why did she look so disturbed when
he had asked her how many times Hurstwood had called? By George! He
remembered now. There was something strange about the whole thing.

He sat down in a rocking-chair to think the better, drawing up one leg
on his knee and frowning mightily.  His mind ran on at a great rate.

And yet Carrie hadn't acted out of the ordinary.  It couldn't be, by
George, that she was deceiving him.  She hadn't acted that way.  Why,
even last night she had been as friendly toward him as could be, and
Hurstwood too.  Look how they acted! He could hardly believe they would
try to deceive him.

His thoughts burst into words.

"She did act sort of funny at times.  Here she had dressed, and gone
out this morning and never said a word."

He scratched his head and prepared to go down town.  He was still
frowning.  As he came into the hall he encountered the girl, who was
now looking after another chamber.  She had on a white dusting cap,
beneath which her chubby face shone good-naturedly. Drouet almost
forgot his worry in the fact that she was smiling on him.  He put his
hand familiarly on her shoulder, as if only to greet her in passing.

"Got over being mad?" she said, still mischievously inclined.

"I'm not mad," he answered.

"I thought you were," she said, smiling.

"Quit your fooling about that," he said, in an offhand way. "Were you
serious?"

"Certainly," she answered.  Then, with an air of one who did not
intentionally mean to create trouble, "He came lots of times.  I
thought you knew."

The game of deception was up with Drouet.  He did not try to simulate
indifference further.

"Did he spend the evenings here?" he asked.

"Sometimes.  Sometimes they went out."

"In the evening?"

"Yes.  You mustn't look so mad, though."

"I'm not," he said.  "Did any one else see him?"

"Of course," said the girl, as if, after all, it were nothing in
particular.

"How long ago was this?"

"Just before you came back."

The drummer pinched his lip nervously.

"Don't say anything, will you?" he asked, giving the girl's arm a
gentle squeeze.

"Certainly not," she returned.  "I wouldn't worry over it."

"All right," he said, passing on, seriously brooding for once, and yet
not wholly unconscious of the fact that he was making a most excellent
impression upon the chambermaid.

"I'll see her about that," he said to himself, passionately, feeling
that he had been unduly wronged.  "I'll find out, b'George, whether
she'll act that way or not."




 Chapter XXI
THE LURE OF THE SPIRIT--THE FLESH IN PURSUIT

 When Carrie came Hurstwood had been waiting many minutes.  His blood
was warm; his nerves wrought up.  He was anxious to see the woman who
had stirred him so profoundly the night before.

"Here you are," he said, repressedly, feeling a spring in his limbs and
an elation which was tragic in itself.

"Yes," said Carrie.

They walked on as if bound for some objective point, while Hurstwood
drank in the radiance of her presence.  The rustle of her pretty skirt
was like music to him.

"Are you satisfied?" he asked, thinking of how well she did the night
before.

"Are you?"

He tightened his fingers as he saw the smile she gave him.

"It was wonderful."

Carrie laughed ecstatically.

"That was one of the best things I've seen in a long time," he added.

He was dwelling on her attractiveness as he had felt it the evening
before, and mingling it with the feeling her presence inspired now.

Carrie was dwelling in the atmosphere which this man created for her.
Already she was enlivened and suffused with a glow.  She felt his
drawing toward her in every sound of his voice.

"Those were such nice flowers you sent me," she said, after a moment or
two.  "They were beautiful."

"Glad you liked them," he answered, simply.

He was thinking all the time that the subject of his desire was being
delayed.  He was anxious to turn the talk to his own feelings.  All was
ripe for it.  His Carrie was beside him.  He wanted to plunge in and
expostulate with her, and yet he found himself fishing for words and
feeling for a way.

"You got home all right," he said, gloomily, of a sudden, his tune
modifying itself to one of self-commiseration.

"Yes," said Carrie, easily.

He looked at her steadily for a moment, slowing his pace and fixing her
with his eye.

She felt the flood of feeling.

"How about me?" he asked.

This confused Carrie considerably, for she realized the floodgates were
open.  She didn't know exactly what to answer. "I don't know," she
answered.

He took his lower lip between his teeth for a moment, and then let it
go.  He stopped by the walk side and kicked the grass with his toe.  He
searched her face with a tender, appealing glance.

"Won't you come away from him?" he asked, intensely.

"I don't know," returned Carrie, still illogically drifting and finding
nothing at which to catch.

As a matter of fact, she was in a most hopeless quandary.  Here was a
man whom she thoroughly liked, who exercised an influence over her,
sufficient almost to delude her into the belief that she was possessed
of a lively passion for him.  She was still the victim of his keen
eyes, his suave manners, his fine clothes. She looked and saw before
her a man who was most gracious and sympathetic, who leaned toward her
with a feeling that was a delight to observe.  She could not resist the
glow of his temperament, the light of his eye.  She could hardly keep
from feeling what he felt.

And yet she was not without thoughts which were disturbing.  What did
he know? What had Drouet told him? Was she a wife in his eyes, or what?
Would he marry her? Even while he talked, and she softened, and her
eyes were lighted with a tender glow, she was asking herself if Drouet
had told him they were not married. There was never anything at all
convincing about what Drouet said.

And yet she was not grieved at Hurstwood's love.  No strain of
bitterness was in it for her, whatever he knew.  He was evidently
sincere.  His passion was real and warm.  There was power in what he
said.  What should she do? She went on thinking this, answering
vaguely, languishing affectionately, and altogether drifting, until she
was on a borderless sea of speculation.

"Why don't you come away?" he said, tenderly.  "I will arrange for you
whatever--"

"Oh, don't," said Carrie.

"Don't what?" he asked.  "What do you mean?"

There was a look of confusion and pain in her face.  She was wondering
why that miserable thought must be brought in.  She was struck as by a
blade with the miserable provision which was outside the pale of
marriage.

He himself realized that it was a wretched thing to have dragged in.
He wanted to weigh the effects of it, and yet he could not see.  He
went beating on, flushed by her presence, clearly awakened, intensely
enlisted in his plan.

"Won't you come?" he said, beginning over and with a more reverent
feeling.  "You know I can't do without you--you know it-it can't go on
this way--can it?"

"I know," said Carrie.

"I wouldn't ask if I--I wouldn't argue with you if I could help it.
Look at me, Carrie.  Put yourself in my place.  You don't want to stay
away from me, do you?"

She shook her head as if in deep thought. "Then why not settle the
whole thing, once and for all?"

"I don't know," said Carrie.

"Don't know! Ah, Carrie, what makes you say that? Don't torment me.  Be
serious."

"I am," said Carrie, softly.

"You can't be, dearest, and say that.  Not when you know how I love
you.  Look at last night."

His manner as he said this was the most quiet imaginable.  His face and
body retained utter composure.  Only his eyes moved, and they flashed a
subtle, dissolving fire.  In them the whole intensity of the man's
nature was distilling itself.

Carrie made no answer.

"How can you act this way, dearest?" he inquired, after a time. "You
love me, don't you?"

He turned on her such a storm of feeling that she was overwhelmed.  For
the moment all doubts were cleared away.

"Yes," she answered, frankly and tenderly.

"Well, then you'll come, won't you--come to-night?"

Carrie shook her head in spite of her distress.

"I can't wait any longer," urged Hurstwood.  "If that is too soon, come
Saturday."

"When will we be married?" she asked, diffidently, forgetting in her
difficult situation that she had hoped he took her to be Drouet's wife.

The manager started, hit as he was by a problem which was more
difficult than hers.  He gave no sign of the thoughts that flashed like
messages to his mind.

"Any time you say," he said, with ease, refusing to discolor his
present delight with this miserable problem.

"Saturday?" asked Carrie.

He nodded his head.

"Well, if you will marry me then," she said, "I'll go."

The manager looked at his lovely prize, so beautiful, so winsome, so
difficult to be won, and made strange resolutions.  His passion had
gotten to that stage now where it was no longer colored with reason.
He did not trouble over little barriers of this sort in the face of so
much loveliness.  He would accept the situation with all its
difficulties; he would not try to answer the objections which cold
truth thrust upon him.  He would promise anything, everything, and
trust to fortune to disentangle him.  He would make a try for Paradise,
whatever might be the result.  He would be happy, by the Lord, if it
cost all honesty of statement, all abandonment of truth.

Carrie looked at him tenderly.  She could have laid her head upon his
shoulder, so delightful did it all seem. "Well," she said, "I'll try
and get ready then."

Hurstwood looked into her pretty face, crossed with little shadows of
wonder and misgiving, and thought he had never seen anything more
lovely.

"I'll see you again to-morrow," he said, joyously, "and we'll talk over
the plans."

He walked on with her, elated beyond words, so delightful had been the
result.  He impressed a long story of joy and affection upon her,
though there was but here and there a word.  After a half-hour he began
to realize that the meeting must come to an end, so exacting is the
world.

"To-morrow," he said at parting, a gayety of manner adding wonderfully
to his brave demeanor.

"Yes," said Carrie, tripping elatedly away.

There had been so much enthusiasm engendered that she was believing
herself deeply in love.  She sighed as she thought of her handsome
adorer.  Yes, she would get ready by Saturday.  She would go, and they
would be happy.




Chapter XXII
THE BLAZE OF THE TINDER--FLESH WARS WITH THE FLESH

 The misfortune of the Hurstwood household was due to the fact that
jealousy, having been born of love, did not perish with it. Mrs.
Hurstwood retained this in such form that subsequent influences could
transform it into hate.  Hurstwood was still worthy, in a physical
sense, of the affection his wife had once bestowed upon him, but in a
social sense he fell short.  With his regard died his power to be
attentive to her, and this, to a woman, is much greater than outright
crime toward another.  Our self-love dictates our appreciation of the
good or evil in another.  In Mrs. Hurstwood it discolored the very hue
of her husband's indifferent nature.  She saw design in deeds and
phrases which sprung only from a faded appreciation of her presence.

As a consequence, she was resentful and suspicious.  The jealousy that
prompted her to observe every falling away from the little amenities of
the married relation on his part served to give her notice of the airy
grace with which he still took the world.  She could see from the
scrupulous care which he exercised in the matter of his personal
appearance that his interest in life had abated not a jot.  Every
motion, every glance had something in it of the pleasure he felt in
Carrie, of the zest this new pursuit of pleasure lent to his days.
Mrs. Hurstwood felt something, sniffing change, as animals do danger,
afar off.

This feeling was strengthened by actions of a direct and more potent
nature on the part of Hurstwood.  We have seen with what irritation he
shirked those little duties which no longer contained any amusement of
satisfaction for him, and the open snarls with which, more recently, he
resented her irritating goads.  These little rows were really
precipitated by an atmosphere which was surcharged with dissension.
That it would shower, with a sky so full of blackening thunderclouds,
would scarcely be thought worthy of comment.  Thus, after leaving the
breakfast table this morning, raging inwardly at his blank declaration
of indifference at her plans, Mrs. Hurstwood encountered Jessica in her
dressing-room, very leisurely arranging her hair.  Hurstwood had
already left the house.

"I wish you wouldn't be so late coming down to breakfast," she said,
addressing Jessica, while making for her crochet basket. "Now here the
things are quite cold, and you haven't eaten."

Her natural composure was sadly ruffled, and Jessica was doomed to feel
the fag end of the storm.

"I'm not hungry," she answered.

"Then why don't you say so, and let the girl put away the things,
instead of keeping her waiting all morning?"

"She doesn't mind," answered Jessica, coolly.

"Well, I do, if she doesn't," returned the mother, "and, anyhow, I
don't like you to talk that way to me.  You're too young to put on such
an air with your mother."

"Oh, mamma, don't row,"; answered Jessica.  "What's the matter this
morning, anyway?"

"Nothing's the matter, and I'm not rowing.  You mustn't think because I
indulge you in some things that you can keep everybody waiting.  I
won't have it."

"I'm not keeping anybody waiting," returned Jessica, sharply, stirred
out of a cynical indifference to a sharp defense.  "I said I wasn't
hungry.  I don't want any breakfast."

"Mind how you address me, missy.  I'll not have it.  Hear me now; I'll
not have it!"

Jessica heard this last while walking out of the room, with a toss of
her head and a flick of her pretty skirts indicative of the
independence and indifference she felt.  She did not propose to be
quarreled with.

Such little arguments were all too frequent, the result of a growth of
natures which were largely independent and selfish. George, Jr.,
manifested even greater touchiness and exaggeration in the matter of
his individual rights, and attempted to make all feel that he was a man
with a man's privileges--an assumption which, of all things, is most
groundless and pointless in a youth of nineteen.

Hurstwood was a man of authority and some fine feeling, and it
irritated him excessively to find himself surrounded more and more by a
world upon which he had no hold, and of which he had a lessening
understanding.

Now, when such little things, such as the proposed earlier start to
Waukesha, came up, they made clear to him his position.  He was being
made to follow, was not leading.  When, in addition, a sharp temper was
manifested, and to the process of shouldering him out of his authority
was added a rousing intellectual kick, such as a sneer or a cynical
laugh, he was unable to keep his temper.  He flew into hardly repressed
passion, and wished himself clear of the whole household.  It seemed a
most irritating drag upon all his desires and opportunities.

For all this, he still retained the semblance of leadership and
control, even though his wife was straining to revolt.  Her display of
temper and open assertion of opposition were based upon nothing more
than the feeling that she could do it.  She had no special evidence
wherewith to justify herself--the knowledge of something which would
give her both authority and excuse.  The latter was all that was
lacking, however, to give a solid foundation to what, in a way, seemed
groundless discontent.  The clear proof of one overt deed was the cold
breath needed to convert the lowering clouds of suspicion into a rain
of wrath.

An inkling of untoward deeds on the part of Hurstwood had come. Doctor
Beale, the handsome resident physician of the neighborhood, met Mrs.
Hurstwood at her own doorstep some days after Hurstwood and Carrie had
taken the drive west on Washington Boulevard.  Dr. Beale, coming east
on the same drive, had recognized Hurstwood, but not before he was
quite past him.  He was not so sure of Carrie--did not know whether it
was Hurstwood's wife or daughter.

"You don't speak to your friends when you meet them out driving, do
you?" he said, jocosely, to Mrs. Hurstwood.

"If I see them, I do.  Where was I?"

"On Washington Boulevard." he answered, expecting her eye to light with
immediate remembrance.

She shook her head.

"Yes, out near Hoyne Avenue.  You were with your husband."

"I guess you're mistaken," she answered.  Then, remembering her
husband's part in the affair, she immediately fell a prey to a host of
young suspicions, of which, however, she gave no sign.

"I know I saw your husband," he went on.  "I wasn't so sure about you.
Perhaps it was your daughter."

"Perhaps it was," said Mrs. Hurstwood, knowing full well that such was
not the case, as Jessica had been her companion for weeks.  She had
recovered herself sufficiently to wish to know more of the details.

"Was it in the afternoon?" she asked, artfully, assuming an air of
acquaintanceship with the matter.

"Yes, about two or three."

"It must have been Jessica," said Mrs. Hurstwood, not wishing to seem
to attach any importance to the incident.

The physician had a thought or two of his own, but dismissed the matter
as worthy of no further discussion on his part at least.

Mrs. Hurstwood gave this bit of information considerable thought during
the next few hours, and even days.  She took it for granted that the
doctor had really seen her husband, and that he had been riding, most
likely, with some other woman, after announcing himself as BUSY to her.
As a consequence, she recalled, with rising feeling, how often he had
refused to go to places with her, to share in little visits, or,
indeed, take part in any of the social amenities which furnished the
diversion of her existence.  He had been seen at the theatre with
people whom he called Moy's friends; now he was seen driving, and, most
likely, would have an excuse for that.  Perhaps there were others of
whom she did not hear, or why should he be so busy, so indifferent, of
late? In the last six weeks he had become strangely irritable--
strangely satisfied to pick up and go out, whether things were right or
wrong in the house.  Why?

She recalled, with more subtle emotions, that he did not look at her
now with any of the old light of satisfaction or approval in his eye.
Evidently, along with other things, he was taking her to be getting old
and uninteresting.  He saw her wrinkles, perhaps.  She was fading,
while he was still preening himself in his elegance and youth.  He was
still an interested factor in the merry-makings of the world, while
she--but she did not pursue the thought.  She only found the whole
situation bitter, and hated him for it thoroughly.

Nothing came of this incident at the time, for the truth is it did not
seem conclusive enough to warrant any discussion.  Only the atmosphere
of distrust and ill-feeling was strengthened, precipitating every now
and then little sprinklings of irritable conversation, enlivened by
flashes of wrath.  The matter of the Waukesha outing was merely a
continuation of other things of the same nature.

The day after Carrie's appearance on the Avery stage, Mrs. Hurstwood
visited the races with Jessica and a youth of her acquaintance, Mr.
Bart Taylor, the son of the owner of a local house-furnishing
establishment.  They had driven out early, and, as it chanced,
encountered several friends of Hurstwood, all Elks, and two of whom had
attended the performance the evening before.  A thousand chances the
subject of the performance had never been brought up had Jessica not
been so engaged by the attentions of her young companion, who usurped
as much time as possible.  This left Mrs. Hurstwood in the mood to
extend the perfunctory greetings of some who knew her into short
conversations, and the short conversations of friends into long ones.
It was from one who meant but to greet her perfunctorily that this
interesting intelligence came.

"I see," said this individual, who wore sporting clothes of the most
attractive pattern, and had a field-glass strung over his shoulder,
"that you did not get over to our little entertainment last evening."

"No?" said Mrs. Hurstwood, inquiringly, and wondering why he should be
using the tone he did in noting the fact that she had not been to
something she knew nothing about.  It was on her lips to say, "What was
it?" when he added, "I saw your husband."

Her wonder was at once replaced by the more subtle quality of
suspicion.

"Yes," she said, cautiously, "was it pleasant? He did not tell me much
about it."

"Very.  Really one of the best private theatricals I ever attended.
There was one actress who surprised us all."

"Indeed," said Mrs. Hurstwood.

"It's too bad you couldn't have been there, really.  I was sorry to
hear you weren't feeling well."

Feeling well! Mrs. Hurstwood could have echoed the words after him
open-mouthed.  As it was, she extricated herself from her mingled
impulse to deny and question, and said, almost raspingly:

"Yes, it is too bad."

"Looks like there will be quite a crowd here to-day, doesn't it?" the
acquaintance observed, drifting off upon another topic.

The manager's wife would have questioned farther, but she saw no
opportunity.  She was for the moment wholly at sea, anxious to think
for herself, and wondering what new deception was this which caused him
to give out that she was ill when she was not. Another case of her
company not wanted, and excuses being made. She resolved to find out
more.

"Were you at the performance last evening?" she asked of the next of
Hurstwood's friends who greeted her as she sat in her box.

"Yes.  You didn't get around."

"No," she answered, "I was not feeling very well."

"So your husband told me," he answered.  "Well, it was really very
enjoyable.  Turned out much better than I expected."

"Were there many there?"

"The house was full.  It was quite an Elk night.  I saw quite a number
of your friends--Mrs. Harrison, Mrs. Barnes, Mrs. Collins."

"Quite a social gathering."

"Indeed it was.  My wife enjoyed it very much."

Mrs. Hurstwood bit her lip.

"So," she thought, "that's the way he does.  Tells my friends I am sick
and cannot come."

She wondered what could induce him to go alone.  There was something
back of this.  She rummaged her brain for a reason.

By evening, when Hurstwood reached home, she had brooded herself into a
state of sullen desire for explanation and revenge.  She wanted to know
what this peculiar action of his imported.  She was certain there was
more behind it all than what she had heard, and evil curiosity mingled
well with distrust and the remnants of her wrath of the morning.  She,
impending disaster itself, walked about with gathered shadow at the
eyes and the rudimentary muscles of savagery fixing the hard lines of
her mouth.

On the other hand, as we may well believe, the manager came home in the
sunniest mood.  His conversation and agreement with Carrie had raised
his spirits until he was in the frame of mind of one who sings
joyously.  He was proud of himself, proud of his success, proud of
Carrie.  He could have been genial to all the world, and he bore no
grudge against his wife.  He meant to be pleasant, to forget her
presence, to live in the atmosphere of youth and pleasure which had
been restored to him.

So now, the house, to his mind, had a most pleasing and comfortable
appearance.  In the hall he found an evening paper, laid there by the
maid and forgotten by Mrs. Hurstwood.  In the dining-room the table was
clean laid with linen and napery and shiny with glasses and decorated
china.  Through an open door he saw into the kitchen, where the fire
was crackling in the stove and the evening meal already well under way.
Out in the small back yard was George, Jr., frolicking with a young dog
he had recently purchased, and in the parlor Jessica was playing at the
piano, the sounds of a merry waltz filling every nook and corner of the
comfortable home.  Every one, like himself, seemed to have regained his
good spirits, to be in sympathy with youth and beauty, to be inclined
to joy and merry-making.  He felt as if he could say a good word all
around himself, and took a most genial glance at the spread table and
polished sideboard before going upstairs to read his paper in the
comfortable armchair of the sitting-room which looked through the open
windows into the street.  When he entered there, however, he found his
wife brushing her hair and musing to herself the while.

He came lightly in, thinking to smooth over any feeling that might
still exist by a kindly word and a ready promise, but Mrs. Hurstwood
said nothing.  He seated himself in the large chair, stirred lightly in
making himself comfortable, opened his paper, and began to read.  In a
few moments he was smiling merrily over a very comical account of a
baseball game which had taken place between the Chicago and Detroit
teams.

The while he was doing this Mrs. Hurstwood was observing him casually
through the medium of the mirror which was before her. She noticed his
pleasant and contented manner, his airy grace and smiling humor, and it
merely aggravated her the more.  She wondered how he could think to
carry himself so in her presence after the cynicism, indifference, and
neglect he had heretofore manifested and would continue to manifest so
long as she would endure it.  She thought how she should like to tell
him--what stress and emphasis she would lend her assertions, how she
should drive over this whole affair until satisfaction should be
rendered her.  Indeed, the shining sword of her wrath was but weakly
suspended by a thread of thought.

In the meanwhile Hurstwood encountered a humorous item concerning a
stranger who had arrived in the city and became entangled with a bunco-
steerer.  It amused him immensely, and at last he stirred and chuckled
to himself.  He wished that he might enlist his wife's attention and
read it to her.

"Ha, ha," he exclaimed softly, as if to himself, "that's funny."

Mrs. Hurstwood kept on arranging her hair, not so much as deigning a
glance.

He stirred again and went on to another subject.  At last he felt as if
his good-humor must find some outlet.  Julia was probably still out of
humor over that affair of this morning, but that could easily be
straightened.  As a matter of fact, she was in the wrong, but he didn't
care.  She could go to Waukesha right away if she wanted to.  The
sooner the better.  He would tell her that as soon as he got a chance,
and the whole thing would blow over.

"Did you notice," he said, at last, breaking forth concerning another
item which he had found, "that they have entered suit to compel the
Illinois Central to get off the lake front, Julia?" he asked.

She could scarcely force herself to answer, but managed to say "No,"
sharply.

Hurstwood pricked up his ears.  There was a note in her voice which
vibrated keenly.

"It would be a good thing if they did," he went on, half to himself,
half to her, though he felt that something was amiss in that quarter.
He withdrew his attention to his paper very circumspectly, listening
mentally for the little sounds which should show him what was on foot.

As a matter of fact, no man as clever as Hurstwood--as observant and
sensitive to atmospheres of many sorts, particularly upon his own plane
of thought--would have made the mistake which he did in regard to his
wife, wrought up as she was, had he not been occupied mentally with a
very different train of thought.  Had not the influence of Carrie's
regard for him, the elation which her promise aroused in him, lasted
over, he would not have seen the house in so pleasant a mood.  It was
not extraordinarily bright and merry this evening.  He was merely very
much mistaken, and would have been much more fitted to cope with it had
he come home in his normal state.

After he had studied his paper a few moments longer, he felt that he
ought to modify matters in some way or other.  Evidently his wife was
not going to patch up peace at a word.  So he said:

"Where did George get the dog he has there in the yard?"

"I don't know," she snapped.

He put his paper down on his knees and gazed idly out of the window.
He did not propose to lose his temper, but merely to be persistent and
agreeable, and by a few questions bring around a mild understanding of
some sort.

"Why do you feel so bad about that affair of this morning? he said, at
last. "We needn't quarrel about that.  You know you can go to Waukesha
if you want to."

"So you can stay here and trifle around with some one else?" she
exclaimed, turning to him a determined countenance upon which was drawn
a sharp and wrathful sneer.

He stopped as if slapped in the face.  In an instant his persuasive,
conciliatory manner fled.  He was on the defensive at a wink and
puzzled for a word to reply.

"What do you mean?" he said at last, straightening himself and gazing
at the cold, determined figure before him, who paid no attention, but
went on arranging herself before the mirror.

"You know what I mean," she said, finally, as if there were a world of
information which she held in reserve--which she did not need to tell.

"Well, I don't," he said, stubbornly, yet nervous and alert for what
should come next.  The finality of the woman's manner took away his
feeling of superiority in battle.

She made no answer.

"Hmph!" he murmured, with a movement of his head to one side.  It was
the weakest thing he had ever done.  It was totally unassured.

Mrs. Hurstwood noticed the lack of color in it.  She turned upon him,
animal-like, able to strike an effectual second blow.

"I want the Waukesha money to-morrow morning," she said.

He looked at her in amazement.  Never before had he seen such a cold,
steely determination in her eye--such a cruel look of indifference.
She seemed a thorough master of her mood-thoroughly confident and
determined to wrest all control from him.  He felt that all his
resources could not defend him.  He must attack.

"What do you mean?" he said, jumping up.  "You want! I'd like to know
what's got into you to-night."

"Nothing's GOT into me," she said, flaming.  "I want that money. You
can do your swaggering afterwards."

"Swaggering, eh! What! You'll get nothing from me.  What do you mean by
your insinuations, anyhow?"

"Where were you last night?" she answered.  The words were hot as they
came.  "Who were you driving with on Washington Boulevard? Who were you
with at the theatre when George saw you? Do you think I'm a fool to be
duped by you? Do you think I'll sit at home here and take your 'too
busys' and 'can't come,' while you parade around and make out that I'm
unable to come? I want you to know that lordly airs have come to an end
so far as I am concerned.  You can't dictate to me nor my children.
I'm through with you entirely."

"It's a lie," he said, driven to a corner and knowing no other excuse.

"Lie, eh!" she said, fiercely, but with returning reserve; "you may
call it a lie if you want to, but I know."

"It's a lie, I tell you," he said, in a low, sharp voice. "You've been
searching around for some cheap accusation for months and now you think
you have it.  You think you'll spring something and get the upper hand.
Well, I tell you, you can't. As long as I'm in this house I'm master of
it, and you or any one else won't dictate to me--do you hear?"

He crept toward her with a light in his eye that was ominous. Something
in the woman's cool, cynical, upper-handish manner, as if she were
already master, caused him to feel for the moment as if he could
strangle her.

She gazed at him--a pythoness in humor.

"I'm not dictating to you," she returned; "I'm telling you what I
want."

The answer was so cool, so rich in bravado, that somehow it took the
wind out of his sails.  He could not attack her, he could not ask her
for proofs.  Somehow he felt evidence, law, the remembrance of all his
property which she held in her name, to be shining in her glance.  He
was like a vessel, powerful and dangerous, but rolling and floundering
without sail.

"And I'm telling you," he said in the end, slightly recovering himself,
"what you'll not get."

"We'll see about it," she said.  "I'll find out what my rights are.
Perhaps you'll talk to a lawyer, if you won't to me."

It was a magnificent play, and had its effect.  Hurstwood fell back
beaten.  He knew now that he had more than mere bluff to contend with.
He felt that he was face to face with a dull proposition.  What to say
he hardly knew.  All the merriment had gone out of the day.  He was
disturbed, wretched, resentful. What should he do? "Do as you please,"
he said, at last.  "I'll have nothing more to do with you," and out he
strode.




Chapter XXIII
A SPIRIT IN TRAVAIL--ONE RUNG PUT BEHIND

 When Carrie reached her own room she had already fallen a prey to
those doubts and misgivings which are ever the result of a lack of
decision.  She could not persuade herself as to the advisability of her
promise, or that now, having given her word, she ought to keep it.  She
went over the whole ground in Hurstwood's absence, and discovered
little objections that had not occurred to her in the warmth of the
manager's argument.  She saw where she had put herself in a peculiar
light, namely, that of agreeing to marry when she was already
supposedly married. She remembered a few things Drouet had done, and
now that it came to walking away from him without a word, she felt as
if she were doing wrong.  Now, she was comfortably situated, and to one
who is more or less afraid of the world, this is an urgent matter, and
one which puts up strange, uncanny arguments.  "You do not know what
will come.  There are miserable things outside.  People go a-begging.
Women are wretched.  You never can tell what will happen.  Remember the
time you were hungry.  Stick to what you have."

Curiously, for all her leaning towards Hurstwood, he had not taken a
firm hold on her understanding.  She was listening, smiling, approving,
and yet not finally agreeing.  This was due to a lack of power on his
part, a lack of that majesty of passion that sweeps the mind from its
seat, fuses and melts all arguments and theories into a tangled mass,
and destroys for the time being the reasoning power.  This majesty of
passion is possessed by nearly every man once in his life, but it is
usually an attribute of youth and conduces to the first successful
mating.

Hurstwood, being an older man, could scarcely be said to retain the
fire of youth, though he did possess a passion warm and unreasoning.
It was strong enough to induce the leaning toward him which, on
Carrie's part, we have seen.  She might have been said to be imagining
herself in love, when she was not.  Women frequently do this.  It flows
from the fact that in each exists a bias toward affection, a craving
for the pleasure of being loved. The longing to be shielded, bettered,
sympathized with, is one of the attributes of the sex.  This, coupled
with sentiment and a natural tendency to emotion, often makes refusing
difficult.  It persuades them that they are in love.

Once at home, she changed her clothes and straightened the rooms for
herself.  In the matter of the arrangement of the furniture she never
took the housemaid's opinion.  That young woman invariably put one of
the rocking-chairs in the corner, and Carrie as regularly moved it out.
To-day she hardly noticed that it was in the wrong place, so absorbed
was she in her own thoughts.  She worked about the room until Drouet
put in appearance at five o'clock.  The drummer was flushed and excited
and full of determination to know all about her relations with
Hurstwood.  Nevertheless, after going over the subject in his mind the
livelong day, he was rather weary of it and wished it over with.  He
did not foresee serious consequences of any sort, and yet he rather
hesitated to begin.  Carrie was sitting by the window when he came in,
rocking and looking out. "Well," she said innocently, weary of her own
mental discussion and wondering at his haste and ill-concealed
excitement, "what makes you hurry so?"

Drouet hesitated, now that he was in her presence, uncertain as to what
course to pursue.  He was no diplomat.  He could neither read nor see.

"When did you get home?" he asked foolishly.

"Oh, an hour or so ago.  What makes you ask that?"

"You weren't here," he said, "when I came back this morning, and I
thought you had gone out."

"So I did," said Carrie simply.  "I went for a walk."

Drouet looked at her wonderingly.  For all his lack of dignity in such
matters he did not know how to begin.  He stared at her in the most
flagrant manner until at last she said:

"What makes you stare at me so? What's the matter?"

"Nothing," he answered.  "I was just thinking."

"Just thinking what?" she returned smilingly, puzzled by his attitude.

"Oh, nothing--nothing much."

"Well, then, what makes you look so?"

Drouet was standing by the dresser, gazing at her in a comic manner.
He had laid off his hat and gloves and was now fidgeting with the
little toilet pieces which were nearest him.  He hesitated to believe
that the pretty woman before him was involved in anything so
unsatisfactory to himself.  He was very much inclined to feel that it
was all right, after all.  Yet the knowledge imparted to him by the
chambermaid was rankling in his mind.  He wanted to plunge in with a
straight remark of some sort, but he knew not what.

"Where did you go this morning?" he finally asked weakly.

"Why, I went for a walk," said Carrie.

"Sure you did?" he asked.

"Yes, what makes you ask?"

She was beginning to see now that he knew something.  Instantly she
drew herself into a more reserved position.  Her cheeks blanched
slightly.

"I thought maybe you didn't," he said, beating about the bush in the
most useless manner.

Carrie gazed at him, and as she did so her ebbing courage halted. She
saw that he himself was hesitating, and with a woman's intuition
realized that there was no occasion for great alarm.

"What makes you talk like that?" she asked, wrinkling her pretty
forehead.  "You act so funny to-night."

"I feel funny," he answered. They looked at one another for a moment,
and then Drouet plunged desperately into his subject.

"What's this about you and Hurstwood?" he asked.

"Me and Hurstwood--what do you mean?"

"Didn't he come here a dozen times while I was away?"

"A dozen times," repeated Carrie, guiltily.  "No, but what do you
mean?"

"Somebody said that you went out riding with him and that he came here
every night."

"No such thing," answered Carrie.  "It isn't true.  Who told you that?"

She was flushing scarlet to the roots of her hair, but Drouet did not
catch the full hue of her face, owing to the modified light of the
room.  He was regaining much confidence as Carrie defended herself with
denials.

"Well, some one," he said.  "You're sure you didn't?"

"Certainly," said Carrie.  "You know how often he came."

Drouet paused for a moment and thought.

"I know what you told me," he said finally.

He moved nervously about, while Carrie looked at him confusedly.

"Well, I know that I didn't tell you any such thing as that," said
Carrie, recovering herself.

"If I were you," went on Drouet, ignoring her last remark, "I wouldn't
have anything to do with him.  He's a married man, you know."

"Who--who is?" said Carrie, stumbling at the word.

"Why, Hurstwood," said Drouet, noting the effect and feeling that he
was delivering a telling blow.

"Hurstwood!" exclaimed Carrie, rising.  Her face had changed several
shades since this announcement was made.  She looked within and without
herself in a half-dazed way.

"Who told you this?" she asked, forgetting that her interest was out of
order and exceedingly incriminating.

"Why, I know it.  I've always known it," said Drouet.

Carrie was feeling about for a right thought.  She was making a most
miserable showing, and yet feelings were generating within her which
were anything but crumbling cowardice.

"I thought I told you," he added.

"No, you didn't," she contradicted, suddenly recovering her voice.
"You didn't do anything of the kind."

Drouet listened to her in astonishment.  This was something new.

"I thought I did," he said.

Carrie looked around her very solemnly, and then went over to the
window.

"You oughtn't to have had anything to do with him," said Drouet in an
injured tone, "after all I've done for you."

"You," said Carrie, "you! What have you done for me?"

Her little brain had been surging with contradictory feelings-shame at
exposure, shame at Hurstwood's perfidy, anger at Drouet's deception,
the mockery he had made at her.  Now one clear idea came into her head.
He was at fault.  There was no doubt about it.  Why did he bring
Hurstwood out--Hurstwood, a married man, and never say a word to her?
Never mind now about Hurstwood's perfidy--why had he done this? Why
hadn't he warned her? There he stood now, guilty of this miserable
breach of confidence and talking about what he had done for her!

"Well, I like that," exclaimed Drouet, little realizing the fire his
remark had generated.  "I think I've done a good deal."

"You have, eh?" she answered.  "You've deceived me--that's what you've
done.  You've brought your old friends out here under false pretences.
You've made me out to be--Oh," and with this her voice broke and she
pressed her two little hands together tragically.

"I don't see what that's got to do with it," said the drummer quaintly.

"No," she answered, recovering herself and shutting her teeth. "No, of
course you don't see.  There isn't anything you see.  You couldn't have
told me in the first place, could you? You had to make me out wrong
until it was too late.  Now you come sneaking around with your
information and your talk about what you have done."

Drouet had never suspected this side of Carrie's nature.  She was alive
with feeling, her eyes snapping, her lips quivering, her whole body
sensible of the injury she felt, and partaking of her wrath.

"Who's sneaking?" he asked, mildly conscious of error on his part, but
certain that he was wronged.

"You are," stamped Carrie.  "You're a horrid, conceited coward, that's
what you are.  If you had any sense of manhood in you, you wouldn't
have thought of doing any such thing."

The drummer stared.

"I'm not a coward," he said.  "What do you mean by going with other
men, anyway?"

"Other men!" exclaimed Carrie.  "Other men--you know better than that.
I did go with Mr. Hurstwood, but whose fault was it? Didn't you bring
him here? You told him yourself that he should come out here and take
me out.  Now, after it's all over, you come and tell me that I oughtn't
to go with him and that he's a married man."

She paused at the sound of the last two words and wrung her hands.  The
knowledge of Hurstwood's perfidy wounded her like a knife. "Oh," she
sobbed, repressing herself wonderfully and keeping her eyes dry.  "Oh,
oh!"

"Well, I didn't think you'd be running around with him when I was
away," insisted Drouet.

"Didn't think!" said Carrie, now angered to the core by the man's
peculiar attitude.  "Of course not.  You thought only of what would be
to your satisfaction.  You thought you'd make a toy of me--a plaything.
Well, I'll show you that you won't.  I'll have nothing more to do with
you at all.  You can take your old things and keep them," and
unfastening a little pin he had given her, she flung it vigorously upon
the floor and began to move about as if to gather up the things which
belonged to her.

By this Drouet was not only irritated but fascinated the more. He
looked at her in amazement, and finally said:

"I don't see where your wrath comes in.  I've got the right of this
thing.  You oughtn't to have done anything that wasn't right after all
I did for you."

"What have you done for me?" asked Carrie blazing, her head thrown back
and her lips parted.

"I think I've done a good deal," said the drummer, looking around.
"I've given you all the clothes you wanted, haven't I? I've taken you
everywhere you wanted to go.  You've had as much as I've had, and more
too."

Carrie was not ungrateful, whatever else might be said of her. In so
far as her mind could construe, she acknowledged benefits received.
She hardly knew how to answer this, and yet her wrath was not placated.
She felt that the drummer had injured her irreparably.

"Did I ask you to?" she returned.

"Well, I did it," said Drouet, "and you took it."

"You talk as though I had persuaded you," answered Carrie.  "You stand
there and throw up what you've done.  I don't want your old things.
I'll not have them.  You take them to-night and do what you please with
them.  I'll not stay here another minute."

"That's nice!" he answered, becoming angered now at the sense of his
own approaching loss.  "Use everything and abuse me and then walk off.
That's just like a woman.  I take you when you haven't got anything,
and then when some one else comes along, why I'm no good.  I always
thought it'd come out that way."

He felt really hurt as he thought of his treatment, and looked as if he
saw no way of obtaining justice.

"It's not so," said Carrie, "and I'm not going with anybody else. You
have been as miserable and inconsiderate as you can be.  I hate you, I
tell you, and I wouldn't live with you another minute.  You're a big,
insulting"--here she hesitated and used no word at all--"or you
wouldn't talk that way."

She had secured her hat and jacket and slipped the latter on over her
little evening dress.  Some wisps of wavy hair had loosened from the
bands at the side of her head and were straggling over her hot, red
cheeks.  She was angry, mortified, grief-stricken. Her large eyes were
full of the anguish of tears, but her lids were not yet wet.  She was
distracted and uncertain, deciding and doing things without an aim or
conclusion, and she had not the slightest conception of how the whole
difficulty would end.

"Well, that's a fine finish," said Drouet.  "Pack up and pull out, eh?
You take the cake.  I bet you were knocking around with Hurstwood or
you wouldn't act like that.  I don't want the old rooms.  You needn't
pull out for me.  You can have them for all I care, but b'George, you
haven't done me right."

"I'll not live with you," said Carrie.  "I don't want to live with you.
You've done nothing but brag around ever since you've been here."

"Aw, I haven't anything of the kind," he answered.

Carrie walked over to the door.

"Where are you going?" he said, stepping over and heading her off.

"Let me out," she said.

"Where are you going?" he repeated.

He was, above all, sympathetic, and the sight of Carrie wandering out,
he knew not where, affected him, despite his grievance.

Carrie merely pulled at the door.

The strain of the situation was too much for her, however.  She made
one more vain effort and then burst into tears.

"Now, be reasonable, Cad," said Drouet gently.  "What do you want to
rush out for this way? You haven't any place to go.  Why not stay here
now and be quiet? I'll not bother you.  I don't want to stay here any
longer."

Carrie had gone sobbing from the door to the window.  She was so
overcome she could not speak.

"Be reasonable now," he said.  "I don't want to hold you.  You can go
if you want to, but why don't you think it over? Lord knows, I don't
want to stop you."

He received no answer.  Carrie was quieting, however, under the
influence of his plea.

"You stay here now, and I'll go," he added at last.

Carrie listened to this with mingled feelings.  Her mind was shaken
loose from the little mooring of logic that it had.  She was stirred by
this thought, angered by that--her own injustice, Hurstwood's,
Drouet's, their respective qualities of kindness and favor, the threat
of the world outside, in which she had failed once before, the
impossibility of this state inside, where the chambers were no longer
justly hers, the effect of the argument upon her nerves, all combined
to make her a mass of jangling fibers--an anchorless, storm-beaten
little craft which could do absolutely nothing but drift.

"Say," said Drouet, coming over to her after a few moments, with a new
idea, and putting his hand upon her.

"Don't!" said Carrie, drawing away, but not removing her handkerchief
from her eyes. "Never mind about this quarrel now.  Let it go.  You
stay here until the month's out, anyhow, and then you can tell better
what you want to do.  Eh?"

Carrie made no answer.

"You'd better do that," he said.  "There's no use your packing up now.
You can't go anywhere."

Still he got nothing for his words.

"If you'll do that, we'll call it off for the present and I'll get
out."

Carrie lowered her handkerchief slightly and looked out of the window.

"Will you do that?" he asked.

Still no answer.

"Will you?" he repeated.

She only looked vaguely into the street.

"Aw! come on," he said, "tell me.  Will you?"

"I don't know," said Carrie softly, forced to answer.

"Promise me you'll do that," he said, "and we'll quit talking about it.
It'll be the best thing for you."

Carrie heard him, but she could not bring herself to answer reasonably.
She felt that the man was gentle, and that his interest in her had not
abated, and it made her suffer a pang of regret.  She was in a most
helpless plight.

As for Drouet, his attitude had been that of the jealous lover. Now his
feelings were a mixture of anger at deception, sorrow at losing Carrie,
misery at being defeated.  He wanted his rights in some way or other,
and yet his rights included the retaining of Carrie, the making her
feel her error.

"Will you?" he urged.

"Well, I'll see," said Carrie.

This left the matter as open as before, but it was something.  It
looked as if the quarrel would blow over, if they could only get some
way of talking to one another.  Carrie was ashamed, and Drouet
aggrieved.  He pretended to take up the task of packing some things in
a valise.

Now, as Carrie watched him out of the corner of her eye, certain sound
thoughts came into her head.  He had erred, true, but what had she
done? He was kindly and good-natured for all his egotism. Throughout
this argument he had said nothing very harsh.  On the other hand, there
was Hurstwood--a greater deceiver than he.  He had pretended all this
affection, all this passion, and he was lying to her all the while.
Oh, the perfidy of men! And she had loved him.  There could be nothing
more in that quarter.  She would see Hurstwood no more.  She would
write him and let him know what she thought.  Thereupon what would she
do? Here were these rooms.  Here was Drouet, pleading for her to
remain. Evidently things could go on here somewhat as before, if all
were arranged.  It would be better than the street, without a place to
lay her head.

All this she thought of as Drouet rummaged the drawers for collars and
labored long and painstakingly at finding a shirt stud.  He was in no
hurry to rush this matter.  He felt an attraction to Carrie which would
not down.  He could not think that the thing would end by his walking
out of the room.  There must be some way round, some way to make her
own up that he was right and she was wrong--to patch up a peace and
shut out Hurstwood for ever.  Mercy, how he turned at the man's
shameless duplicity.

"Do you think," he said, after a few moments' silence, "that you'll try
and get on the stage?"

He was wondering what she was intending.

"I don't know what I'll do yet," said Carrie.

"If you do, maybe I can help you.  I've got a lot of friends in that
line."

She made no answer to this.

"Don't go and try to knock around now without any money.  Let me help
you," he said.  "It's no easy thing to go on your own hook here."

Carrie only rocked back and forth in her chair.

"I don't want you to go up against a hard game that way."

He bestirred himself about some other details and Carrie rocked on.

"Why don't you tell me all about this thing," he said, after a time,
"and let's call it off? You don't really care for Hurstwood, do you?"

"Why do you want to start on that again?" said Carrie.  "You were to
blame."

"No, I wasn't," he answered.

"Yes, you were, too," said Carrie.  "You shouldn't have ever told me
such a story as that."

"But you didn't have much to do with him, did you?" went on Drouet,
anxious for his own peace of mind to get some direct denial from her.

"I won't talk about it," said Carrie, pained at the quizzical turn the
peace arrangement had taken.

"What's the use of acting like that now, Cad?" insisted the drummer,
stopping in his work and putting up a hand expressively. "You might let
me know where I stand, at least."

"I won't," said Carrie, feeling no refuge but in anger. "Whatever has
happened is your own fault."

"Then you do care for him?" said Drouet, stopping completely and
experiencing a rush of feeling.

"Oh, stop!" said Carrie. "Well, I'll not be made a fool of," exclaimed
Drouet.  "You may trifle around with him if you want to, but you can't
lead me. You can tell me or not, just as you want to, but I won't fool
any longer!"

He shoved the last few remaining things he had laid out into his valise
and snapped it with a vengeance.  Then he grabbed his coat, which he
had laid off to work, picked up his gloves, and started out.

"You can go to the deuce as far as I am concerned," he said, as he
reached the door.  "I'm no sucker," and with that he opened it with a
jerk and closed it equally vigorously.

Carrie listened at her window view, more astonished than anything else
at this sudden rise of passion in the drummer.  She could hardly
believe her senses--so good-natured and tractable had he invariably
been.  It was not for her to see the wellspring of human passion.  A
real flame of love is a subtle thing.  It burns as a will-o'-the-wisp,
dancing onward to fairylands of delight. It roars as a furnace.  Too
often jealousy is the quality upon which it feeds.




Chapter XXIV
ASHES OF TINDER--A FACE AT THE WINDOW

 That night Hurstwood remained down town entirely, going to the Palmer
House for a bed after his work was through.  He was in a fevered state
of mind, owing to the blight his wife's action threatened to cast upon
his entire future.  While he was not sure how much significance might
be attached to the threat she had made, he was sure that her attitude,
if long continued, would cause him no end of trouble.  She was
determined, and had worsted him in a very important contest.  How would
it be from now on? He walked the floor of his little office, and later
that of his room, putting one thing and another together to no avail.

Mrs. Hurstwood, on the contrary, had decided not to lose her advantage
by inaction.  Now that she had practically cowed him, she would follow
up her work with demands, the acknowledgment of which would make her
word LAW in the future.  He would have to pay her the money which she
would now regularly demand or there would be trouble.  It did not
matter what he did.  She really did not care whether he came home any
more or not.  The household would move along much more pleasantly
without him, and she could do as she wished without consulting any one.
Now she proposed to consult a lawyer and hire a detective.  She would
find out at once just what advantages she could gain.

Hurstwood walked the floor, mentally arranging the chief points of his
situation.  "She has that property in her name," he kept saying to
himself.  "What a fool trick that was.  Curse it! What a fool move that
was."

He also thought of his managerial position.  "If she raises a row now
I'll lose this thing.  They won't have me around if my name gets in the
papers.  My friends, too!" He grew more angry as he thought of the talk
any action on her part would create.  How would the papers talk about
it? Every man he knew would be wondering.  He would have to explain and
deny and make a general mark of himself.  Then Moy would come and
confer with him and there would be the devil to pay.

Many little wrinkles gathered between his eyes as he contemplated this,
and his brow moistened.  He saw no solution of anything-not a loophole
left.

Through all this thoughts of Carrie flashed upon him, and the
approaching affair of Saturday.  Tangled as all his matters were, he
did not worry over that.  It was the one pleasing thing in this whole
rout of trouble.  He could arrange that satisfactorily, for Carrie
would be glad to wait, if necessary. He would see how things turned out
to-morrow, and then he would talk to her.  They were going to meet as
usual.  He saw only her pretty face and neat figure and wondered why
life was not arranged so that such joy as he found with her could be
steadily maintained.  How much more pleasant it would be.  Then he
would take up his wife's threat again, and the wrinkles and moisture
would return.

In the morning he came over from the hotel and opened his mail, but
there was nothing in it outside the ordinary run.  For some reason he
felt as if something might come that way, and was relieved when all the
envelopes had been scanned and nothing suspicious noticed.  He began to
feel the appetite that had been wanting before he had reached the
office, and decided before going out to the park to meet Carrie to drop
in at the Grand Pacific and have a pot of coffee and some rolls.  While
the danger had not lessened, it had not as yet materialized, and with
him no news was good news.  If he could only get plenty of time to
think, perhaps something would turn up.  Surely, surely, this thing
would not drift along to catastrophe and he not find a way out.

His spirits fell, however, when, upon reaching the park, he waited and
waited and Carrie did not come.  He held his favorite post for an hour
or more, then arose and began to walk about restlessly.  Could
something have happened out there to keep her away? Could she have been
reached by his wife? Surely not.  So little did he consider Drouet that
it never once occurred to him to worry about his finding out.  He grew
restless as he ruminated, and then decided that perhaps it was nothing.
She had not been able to get away this morning.  That was why no letter
notifying him had come.  He would get one to-day.  It would probably be
on his desk when he got back.  He would look for it at once.

After a time he gave up waiting and drearily headed for the Madison
car.  To add to his distress, the bright blue sky became overcast with
little fleecy clouds which shut out the sun.  The wind veered to the
east, and by the time he reached his office it was threatening to
drizzle all afternoon.

He went in and examined his letters, but there was nothing from Carrie.
Fortunately, there was nothing from his wife either.  He thanked his
stars that he did not have to confront that proposition just now when
he needed to think so much.  He walked the floor again, pretending to
be in an ordinary mood, but secretly troubled beyond the expression of
words.

At one-thirty he went to Rector's for lunch, and when he returned a
messenger was waiting for him.  He looked at the little chap with a
feeling of doubt.

"I'm to bring an answer," said the boy.

Hurstwood recognized his wife's writing.  He tore it open and read
without a show of feeling.  It began in the most formal manner and was
sharply and coldly worded throughout.

"I want you to send the money I asked for at once.  I need it to carry
out my plans.  You can stay away if you want to.  It doesn't matter in
the least.  But I must have some money.  So don't delay, but send it by
the boy."

When he had finished it, he stood holding it in his hands.  The
audacity of the thing took his breath.  It roused his ire also-the
deepest element of revolt in him.  His first impulse was to write but
four words in reply--"Go to the devil!"--but he compromised by telling
the boy that there would be no reply. Then he sat down in his chair and
gazed without seeing, contemplating the result of his work.  What would
she do about that? The confounded wretch! Was she going to try to
bulldoze him into submission? He would go up there and have it out with
her, that's what he would do.  She was carrying things with too high a
hand.  These were his first thoughts.

Later, however, his old discretion asserted itself.  Something had to
be done.  A climax was near and she would not sit idle. He knew her
well enough to know that when she had decided upon a plan she would
follow it up.  Possibly matters would go into a lawyer's hands at once.

"Damn her!" he said softly, with his teeth firmly set, "I'll make it
hot for her if she causes me trouble.  I'll make her change her tone if
I have to use force to do it!"

He arose from his chair and went and looked out into the street. The
long drizzle had begun.  Pedestrians had turned up collars, and
trousers at the bottom.  Hands were hidden in the pockets of the
umbrella less; umbrellas were up.  The street looked like a sea of
round black cloth roofs, twisting, bobbing, moving. Trucks and vans
were rattling in a noisy line and everywhere men were shielding
themselves as best they could.  He scarcely noticed the picture.  He
was forever confronting his wife, demanding of her to change her
attitude toward him before he worked her bodily harm.

At four o'clock another note came, which simply said that if the money
was not forthcoming that evening the matter would be laid before
Fitzgerald and Moy on the morrow, and other steps would be taken to get
it.

Hurstwood almost exclaimed out loud at the insistency of this thing.
Yes, he would send her the money.  He'd take it to her-he would go up
there and have a talk with her, and that at once.

He put on his hat and looked around for his umbrella.  He would have
some arrangement of this thing.

He called a cab and was driven through the dreary rain to the North
Side.  On the way his temper cooled as he thought of the details of the
case.  What did she know? What had she done? Maybe she'd got hold of
Carrie, who knows--or--or Drouet.  Perhaps she really had evidence, and
was prepared to fell him as a man does another from secret ambush.  She
was shrewd.  Why should she taunt him this way unless she had good
grounds?

He began to wish that he had compromised in some way or other-that he
had sent the money.  Perhaps he could do it up here.  He would go in
and see, anyhow.  He would have no row.  By the time he reached his own
street he was keenly alive to the difficulties of his situation and
wished over and over that some solution would offer itself, that he
could see his way out.  He alighted and went up the steps to the front
door, but it was with a nervous palpitation of the heart.  He pulled
out his key and tried to insert it, but another key was on the inside.
He shook at the knob, but the door was locked.  Then he rang the bell.
No answer.  He rang again--this time harder.  Still no answer.  He
jangled it fiercely several times in succession, but without avail.
Then he went below.

There was a door which opened under the steps into the kitchen,
protected by an iron grating, intended as a safeguard against burglars.
When he reached this he noticed that it also was bolted and that the
kitchen windows were down.  What could it mean? He rang the bell and
then waited.  Finally, seeing that no one was coming, he turned and
went back to his cab.

"I guess they've gone out," he said apologetically to the individual
who was hiding his red face in a loose tarpaulin raincoat.

"I saw a young girl up in that winder," returned the cabby.

Hurstwood looked, but there was no face there now.  He climbed moodily
into the cab, relieved and distressed.

So this was the game, was it? Shut him out and make him pay. Well, by
the Lord, that did beat all!




Chapter XXV
ASHES OF TINDER--THE LOOSING OF STAYS

 When Hurstwood got back to his office again he was in a greater
quandary than ever.  Lord, Lord, he thought, what had he got into? How
could things have taken such a violent turn, and so quickly? He could
hardly realize how it had all come about.  It seemed a monstrous,
unnatural, unwarranted condition which had suddenly descended upon him
without his let or hindrance.

Meanwhile he gave a thought now and then to Carrie.  What could be the
trouble in that quarter? No letter had come, no word of any kind, and
yet here it was late in the evening and she had agreed to meet him that
morning.  To-morrow they were to have met and gone off--where? He saw
that in the excitement of recent events he had not formulated a plan
upon that score.  He was desperately in love, and would have taken
great chances to win her under ordinary circumstances, but now--now
what? Supposing she had found out something? Supposing she, too, wrote
him and told him that she knew all--that she would have nothing more to
do with him? It would be just like this to happen as things were going
now.  Meanwhile he had not sent the money.

He strolled up and down the polished floor of the resort, his hands in
his pockets, his brow wrinkled, his mouth set.  He was getting some
vague comfort out of a good cigar, but it was no panacea for the ill
which affected him.  Every once in a while he would clinch his fingers
and tap his foot--signs of the stirring mental process he was
undergoing.  His whole nature was vigorously and powerfully shaken up,
and he was finding what limits the mind has to endurance.  He drank
more brandy and soda than he had any evening in months.  He was
altogether a fine example of great mental perturbation.

For all his study nothing came of the evening except this--he sent the
money.  It was with great opposition, after two or three hours of the
most urgent mental affirmation and denial, that at last he got an
envelope, placed in it the requested amount, and slowly sealed it up.

Then he called Harry, the boy of all work around the place.

"You take this to this address," he said, handing him the envelope,
"and give it to Mrs. Hurstwood."

"Yes, sir," said the boy.

"If she isn't there bring it back."

"Yes, sir"

"You've seen my wife?" he asked as a precautionary measure as the boy
turned to go.

"Oh, yes, sir.  I know her."

"All right, now.  Hurry right back."

"Any answer?"

"I guess not."

The boy hastened away and the manager fell to his musings.  Now he had
done it.  There was no use speculating over that.  He was beaten for
to-night and he might just as well make the best of it.  But, oh, the
wretchedness of being forced this way! He could see her meeting the boy
at the door and smiling sardonically. She would take the envelope and
know that she had triumphed.  If he only had that letter back he
wouldn't send it.  He breathed heavily and wiped the moisture from his
face.

For relief, he arose and joined in conversation with a few friends who
were drinking.  He tried to get the interest of things about him, but
it was not to be.  All the time his thoughts would run out to his home
and see the scene being therein enacted.  All the time he was wondering
what she would say when the boy handed her the envelope.

In about an hour and three-quarters the boy returned.  He had evidently
delivered the package, for, as he came up, he made no sign of taking
anything out of his pocket.

"Well?" said Hurstwood.

"I gave it to her."

"My wife?"

"Yes, sir."

"Any answer?"

"She said it was high time."

Hurstwood scowled fiercely.

There was no more to be done upon that score that night.  He went on
brooding over his situation until midnight, when he repaired again to
the Palmer House.  He wondered what the morning would bring forth, and
slept anything but soundly upon it. Next day he went again to the
office and opened his mail, suspicious and hopeful of its contents.  No
word from Carrie. Nothing from his wife, which was pleasant.

The fact that he had sent the money and that she had received it worked
to the ease of his mind, for, as the thought that he had done it
receded, his chagrin at it grew less and his hope of peace more.  He
fancied, as he sat at his desk, that nothing would be done for a week
or two.  Meanwhile, he would have time to think.

This process of THINKING began by a reversion to Carrie and the
arrangement by which he was to get her away from Drouet.  How about
that now? His pain at her failure to meet or write him rapidly
increased as he devoted himself to this subject.  He decided to write
her care of the West Side Post-office and ask for an explanation, as
well as to have her meet him.  The thought that this letter would
probably not reach her until Monday chafed him exceedingly.  He must
get some speedier method--but how?

He thought upon it for a half-hour, not contemplating a messenger or a
cab direct to the house, owing to the exposure of it, but finding that
time was slipping away to no purpose, he wrote the letter and then
began to think again.

The hours slipped by, and with them the possibility of the union he had
contemplated.  He had thought to be joyously aiding Carrie by now in
the task of joining her interests to his, and here it was afternoon and
nothing done.  Three o'clock came, four, five, six, and no letter.  The
helpless manager paced the floor and grimly endured the gloom of
defeat.  He saw a busy Saturday ushered out, the Sabbath in, and
nothing done.  All day, the bar being closed, he brooded alone, shut
out from home, from the excitement of his resort, from Carrie, and
without the ability to alter his condition one iota.  It was the worst
Sunday he had spent in his life.

In Monday's second mail he encountered a very legal-looking letter,
which held his interest for some time.  It bore the imprint of the law
offices of McGregor, James and Hay, and with a very formal "Dear Sir,"
and "We beg to state," went on to inform him briefly that they had been
retained by Mrs. Julia Hurstwood to adjust certain matters which
related to her sustenance and property rights, and would he kindly call
and see them about the matter at once.

He read it through carefully several times, and then merely shook his
head.  It seemed as if his family troubles were just beginning.

"Well!" he said after a time, quite audibly, "I don't know."

Then he folded it up and put it in his pocket.

To add to his misery there was no word from Carrie.  He was quite
certain now that she knew he was married and was angered at his
perfidy.  His loss seemed all the more bitter now that he needed her
most.  He thought he would go out and insist on seeing her if she did
not send him word of some sort soon.  He was really affected most
miserably of all by this desertion.  He had loved her earnestly enough,
but now that the possibility of losing her stared him in the face she
seemed much more attractive.  He really pined for a word, and looked
out upon her with his mind's eye in the most wistful manner.  He did
not propose to lose her, whatever she might think.  Come what might, he
would adjust this matter, and soon.  He would go to her and tell her
all his family complications.  He would explain to her just where he
stood and how much he needed her.  Surely she couldn't go back on him
now? It wasn't possible.  He would plead until her anger would melt-
until she would forgive him.

Suddenly he thought: "Supposing she isn't out there--suppose she has
gone?"

He was forced to take his feet.  It was too much to think of and sit
still.

Nevertheless, his rousing availed him nothing.

On Tuesday it was the same way.  He did manage to bring himself into
the mood to go out to Carrie, but when he got in Ogden Place he thought
he saw a man watching him and went away.  He did not go within a block
of the house.

One of the galling incidents of this visit was that he came back on a
Randolph Street car, and without noticing arrived almost opposite the
building of the concern with which his son was connected.  This sent a
pang through his heart.  He had called on his boy there several times.
Now the lad had not sent him a word.  His absence did not seem to be
noticed by either of his children.  Well, well, fortune plays a man
queer tricks.  He got back to his office and joined in a conversation
with friends.  It was as if idle chatter deadened the sense of misery.

That night he dined at Rector's and returned at once to his office.  In
the bustle and show of the latter was his only relief.  He troubled
over many little details and talked perfunctorily to everybody.  He
stayed at his desk long after all others had gone, and only quitted it
when the night watchman on his round pulled at the front door to see if
it was safely locked.

On Wednesday he received another polite note from McGregor, James and
Hay.  It read:

 "Dear Sir: We beg to inform you that we are instructed to wait until
to-morrow (Thursday) at one o'clock, before filing suit against you, on
behalf of Mrs. Julia Hurstwood, for divorce and alimony.  If we do not
hear from you before that time we shall consider that you do not wish
to compromise the matter in any way and act accordingly.  "Very truly
yours, etc."

 "Compromise!" exclaimed Hurstwood bitterly.  "Compromise!"

Again he shook his head.

So here it was spread out clear before him, and now he knew what to
expect.  If he didn't go and see them they would sue him promptly.  If
he did, he would be offered terms that would make his blood boil.  He
folded the letter and put it with the other one.  Then he put on his
hat and went for a turn about the block.




Chapter XXVI
THE AMBASSADOR FALLEN--A SEARCH FOR THE GATE

 Carrie, left alone by Drouet, listened to his retreating steps,
scarcely realizing what had happened.  She knew that he had stormed
out.  It was some moments before she questioned whether he would
return, not now exactly, but ever.  She looked around her upon the
rooms, out of which the evening light was dying, and wondered why she
did not feel quite the same towards them.  She went over to the dresser
and struck a match, lighting the gas. Then she went back to the rocker
to think.

It was some time before she could collect her thoughts, but when she
did, this truth began to take on importance.  She was quite alone.
Suppose Drouet did not come back? Suppose she should never hear
anything more of him? This fine arrangement of chambers would not last
long.  She would have to quit them.

To her credit, be it said, she never once counted on Hurstwood. She
could only approach that subject with a pang of sorrow and regret.  For
a truth, she was rather shocked and frightened by this evidence of
human depravity.  He would have tricked her without turning an eyelash.
She would have been led into a newer and worse situation.  And yet she
could not keep out the pictures of his looks and manners.  Only this
one deed seemed strange and miserable.  It contrasted sharply with all
she felt and knew concerning the man.

But she was alone.  That was the greater thought just at present. How
about that? Would she go out to work again? Would she begin to look
around in the business district? The stage! Oh, yes. Drouet had spoken
about that.  Was there any hope there? She moved to and fro, in deep
and varied thoughts, while the minutes slipped away and night fell
completely.  She had had nothing to eat, and yet there she sat,
thinking it over.

She remembered that she was hungry and went to the little cupboard in
the rear room where were the remains of one of their breakfasts.  She
looked at these things with certain misgivings. The contemplation of
food had more significance than usual.

While she was eating she began to wonder how much money she had. It
struck her as exceedingly important, and without ado she went to look
for her purse.  It was on the dresser, and in it were seven dollars in
bills and some change.  She quailed as she thought of the
insignificance of the amount and rejoiced because the rent was paid
until the end of the month.  She began also to think what she would
have done if she had gone out into the street when she first started.
By the side of that situation, as she looked at it now, the present
seemed agreeable.  She had a little time at least, and then, perhaps,
everything would come out all right, after all.

Drouet had gone, but what of it? He did not seem seriously angry. He
only acted as if he were huffy.  He would come back--of course he
would.  There was his cane in the corner.  Here was one of his collars.
He had left his light overcoat in the wardrobe.  She looked about and
tried to assure herself with the sight of a dozen such details, but,
alas, the secondary thought arrived. Supposing he did come back.  Then
what?

Here was another proposition nearly, if not quite, as disturbing. She
would have to talk with and explain to him.  He would want her to admit
that he was right.  It would be impossible for her to live with him.

On Friday Carrie remembered her appointment with Hurstwood, and the
passing of the hour when she should, by all right of promise, have been
in his company served to keep the calamity which had befallen her
exceedingly fresh and clear.  In her nervousness and stress of mind she
felt it necessary to act, and consequently put on a brown street dress,
and at eleven o'clock started to visit the business portion once again.
She must look for work.

The rain, which threatened at twelve and began at one, served equally
well to cause her to retrace her steps and remain within doors as it
did to reduce Hurstwood's spirits and give him a wretched day.

The morrow was Saturday, a half-holiday in many business quarters, and
besides it was a balmy, radiant day, with the trees and grass shining
exceedingly green after the rain of the night before.  When she went
out the sparrows were twittering merrily in joyous choruses.  She could
not help feeling, as she looked across the lovely park, that life was a
joyous thing for those who did not need to worry, and she wished over
and over that something might interfere now to preserve for her the
comfortable state which she had occupied.  She did not want Drouet or
his money when she thought of it, nor anything more to do with
Hurstwood, but only the content and ease of mind she had experienced,
for, after all, she had been happy--happier, at least, than she was now
when confronted by the necessity of making her way alone.

When she arrived in the business part it was quite eleven o'clock, and
the business had little longer to run.  She did not realize this at
first, being affected by some of the old distress which was a result of
her earlier adventure into this strenuous and exacting quarter.  She
wandered about, assuring herself that she was making up her mind to
look for something, and at the same time feeling that perhaps it was
not necessary to be in such haste about it.  The thing was difficult to
encounter, and she had a few days.  Besides, she was not sure that she
was really face to face again with the bitter problem of self-
sustenance. Anyhow, there was one change for the better.  She knew that
she had improved in appearance.  Her manner had vastly changed.  Her
clothes were becoming, and men--well-dressed men, some of the kind who
before had gazed at her indifferently from behind their polished
railings and imposing office partitions--now gazed into her face with a
soft light in their eyes.  In a way, she felt the power and
satisfaction of the thing, but it did not wholly reassure her.  She
looked for nothing save what might come legitimately and without the
appearance of special favor.  She wanted something, but no man should
buy her by false protestations or favor.  She proposed to earn her
living honestly.

"This store closes at one on Saturdays," was a pleasing and
satisfactory legend to see upon doors which she felt she ought to enter
and inquire for work.  It gave her an excuse, and after encountering
quite a number of them, and noting that the clock registered 12.15, she
decided that it would be no use to seek further to-day, so she got on a
car and went to Lincoln Park. There was always something to see there--
the flowers, the animals, the lake--and she flattered herself that on
Monday she would be up betimes and searching.  Besides, many things
might happen between now and Monday.

Sunday passed with equal doubts, worries, assurances, and heaven knows
what vagaries of mind and spirit.  Every half-hour in the day the
thought would come to her most sharply, like the tail of a swishing
whip, that action--immediate action--was imperative. At other times she
would look about her and assure herself that things were not so bad--
that certainly she would come out safe and sound.  At such times she
would think of Drouet's advice about going on the stage, and saw some
chance for herself in that quarter.  She decided to take up that
opportunity on the morrow.

Accordingly, she arose early Monday morning and dressed herself
carefully.  She did not know just how such applications were made, but
she took it to be a matter which related more directly to the theatre
buildings.  All you had to do was to inquire of some one about the
theatre for the manager and ask for a position.  If there was anything,
you might get it, or, at least, he could tell you how.

She had had no experience with this class of individuals whatsoever,
and did not know the salacity and humor of the theatrical tribe.  She
only knew of the position which Mr. Hale occupied, but, of all things,
she did not wish to encounter that personage, on account of her
intimacy with his wife.

There was, however, at this time, one theatre, the Chicago Opera House,
which was considerably in the public eye, and its manager, David A.
Henderson, had a fair local reputation.  Carrie had seen one or two
elaborate performances there and had heard of several others.  She knew
nothing of Henderson nor of the methods of applying, but she
instinctively felt that this would be a likely place, and accordingly
strolled about in that neighborhood.  She came bravely enough to the
showy entrance way, with the polished and begilded lobby, set with
framed pictures out of the current attraction, leading up to the quiet
box-office, but she could get no further.  A noted comic opera comedian
was holding forth that week, and the air of distinction and prosperity
overawed her. She could not imagine that there would be anything in
such a lofty sphere for her.  She almost trembled at the audacity which
might have carried her on to a terrible rebuff.  She could find heart
only to look at the pictures which were showy and then walk out.  It
seemed to her as if she had made a splendid escape and that it would be
foolhardy to think of applying in that quarter again.

This little experience settled her hunting for one day.  She looked
around elsewhere, but it was from the outside.  She got the location of
several playhouses fixed in her mind--notably the Grand Opera House and
McVickar's, both of which were leading in attractions--and then came
away.  Her spirits were materially reduced, owing to the newly restored
sense of magnitude of the great interests and the insignificance of her
claims upon society, such as she understood them to be.

That night she was visited by Mrs. Hale, whose chatter and protracted
stay made it impossible to dwell upon her predicament or the fortune of
the day.  Before retiring, however, she sat down to think, and gave
herself up to the most gloomy forebodings.  Drouet had not put in an
appearance.  She had had no word from any quarter, she had spent a
dollar of her precious sum in procuring food and paying car fare.  It
was evident that she would not endure long.  Besides, she had
discovered no resource.

In this situation her thoughts went out to her sister in Van Buren
Street, whom she had not seen since the night of her flight, and to her
home at Columbia City, which seemed now a part of something that could
not be again.  She looked for no refuge in that direction.  Nothing but
sorrow was brought her by thoughts of Hurstwood, which would return.
That he could have chosen to dupe her in so ready a manner seemed a
cruel thing.

Tuesday came, and with it appropriate indecision and speculation. She
was in no mood, after her failure of the day before, to hasten forth
upon her work-seeking errand, and yet she rebuked herself for what she
considered her weakness the day before. Accordingly she started out to
revisit the Chicago Opera House, but possessed scarcely enough courage
to approach.

She did manage to inquire at the box-office, however.

"Manager of the company or the house?" asked the smartly dressed
individual who took care of the tickets.  He was favorably impressed by
Carrie's looks.

"I don't know," said Carrie, taken back by the question.

"You couldn't see the manager of the house to-day, anyhow," volunteered
the young man.  "He's out of town."

He noted her puzzled look, and then added: "What is it you wish to see
about?"

"I want to see about getting a position," she answered.

"You'd better see the manager of the company," he returned, "but he
isn't here now."

"When will he be in?" asked Carrie, somewhat relieved by this
information.

"Well, you might find him in between eleven and twelve.  He's here
after two o'clock."

Carrie thanked him and walked briskly out, while the young man gazed
after her through one of the side windows of his gilded coop.

"Good-looking," he said to himself, and proceeded to visions of
condescension's on her part which were exceedingly flattering to
himself.

One of the principal comedy companies of the day was playing an
engagement at the Grand Opera House.  Here Carrie asked to see the
manager of the company.  She little knew the trivial authority of this
individual, or that had there been a vacancy an actor would have been
sent on from New York to fill it.

"His office is upstairs," said a man in the box-office.

Several persons were in the manager's office, two lounging near a
window, another talking to an individual sitting at a roll-top desk--
the manager.  Carrie glanced nervously about, and began to fear that
she should have to make her appeal before the assembled company, two of
whom--the occupants of the window--were already observing her
carefully.

"I can't do it," the manager was saying; "it's a rule of Mr. Frohman's
never to allow visitors back of the stage.  No, no!"

Carrie timidly waited, standing.  There were chairs, but no one
motioned her to be seated.  The individual to whom the manager had been
talking went away quite crestfallen.  That luminary gazed earnestly at
some papers before him, as if they were of the greatest concern.

"Did you see that in the 'Herald' this morning about Nat Goodwin,
Harris?"

"No," said the person addressed.  "What was it?" "Made quite a curtain
address at Hooley's last night.  Better look it up."

Harris reached over to a table and began to look for the "Herald."

"What is it?" said the manager to Carrie, apparently noticing her for
the first time.  He thought he was going to be held up for free
tickets.

Carrie summoned up all her courage, which was little at best. She
realized that she was a novice, and felt as if a rebuff were certain.
Of this she was so sure that she only wished now to pretend she had
called for advice.

"Can you tell me how to go about getting on the stage?"

It was the best way after all to have gone about the matter.  She was
interesting, in a manner, to the occupant of the chair, and the
simplicity of her request and attitude took his fancy.  He smiled, as
did the others in the room, who, however, made some slight effort to
conceal their humor.

"I don't know," he answered, looking her brazenly over.  "Have you ever
had any experience upon the stage?"

"A little," answered Carrie.  "I have taken part in amateur
performances."

She thought she had to make some sort of showing in order to retain his
interest.

"Never studied for the stage?" he said, putting on an air intended as
much to impress his friends with his discretion as Carrie.

"No, sir."

"Well, I don't know," he answered, tipping lazily back in his chair
while she stood before him.  "What makes you want to get on the stage?"

She felt abashed at the man's daring, but could only smile in answer to
his engaging smirk, and say:

"I need to make a living."

"Oh," he answered, rather taken by her trim appearance, and feeling as
if he might scrape up an acquaintance with her. "That's a good reason,
isn't it? Well, Chicago is not a good place for what you want to do.
You ought to be in New York. There's more chance there.  You could
hardly expect to get started out here." Carrie smiled genially,
grateful that he should condescend to advise her even so much.  He
noticed the smile, and put a slightly different construction on it.  He
thought he saw an easy chance for a little flirtation.

"Sit down," he said, pulling a chair forward from the side of his desk
and dropping his voice so that the two men in the room should not hear.
Those two gave each other the suggestion of a wink.

"Well, I'll be going, Barney," said one, breaking away and so
addressing the manager.  "See you this afternoon."

"All right," said the manager.

The remaining individual took up a paper as if to read.

"Did you have any idea what sort of part you would like to get?" asked
the manager softly.

"Oh, no," said Carrie.  "I would take anything to begin with."

"I see," he said.  "Do you live here in the city?"

"Yes, sir."

The manager smiled most blandly.

"Have you ever tried to get in as a chorus girl?" he asked, assuming a
more confidential air.

Carrie began to feel that there was something exuberant and unnatural
in his manner.

"No," she said.

"That's the way most girls begin," he went on, "who go on the stage.
It's a good way to get experience."

He was turning on her a glance of the companionable and persuasive
manner.

"I didn't know that," said Carrie.

"It's a difficult thing," he went on, "but there's always a chance, you
know." Then, as if he suddenly remembered, he pulled out his watch and
consulted it.  "I've an appointment at two," he said, "and I've got to
go to lunch now.  Would you care to come and dine with me? We can talk
it over there."

"Oh, no," said Carrie, the whole motive of the man flashing on her at
once.  "I have an engagement myself."

"That's too bad," he said, realizing that he had been a little
beforehand in his offer and that Carrie was about to go away. "Come in
later.  I may know of something."

"Thank you," she answered, with some trepidation and went out.

"She was good-looking, wasn't she?" said the manager's companion, who
had not caught all the details of the game he had played.

"Yes, in a way," said the other, sore to think the game had been lost.
"She'd never make an actress, though.  Just another chorus girl--that's
all."

This little experience nearly destroyed her ambition to call upon the
manager at the Chicago Opera House, but she decided to do so after a
time.  He was of a more sedate turn of mind.  He said at once that
there was no opening of any sort, and seemed to consider her search
foolish.

"Chicago is no place to get a start," he said.  "You ought to be in New
York."

Still she persisted, and went to McVickar's, where she could not find
any one.  "The Old Homestead" was running there, but the person to whom
she was referred was not to be found.

These little expeditions took up her time until quite four o'clock,
when she was weary enough to go home.  She felt as if she ought to
continue and inquire elsewhere, but the results so far were too
dispiriting.  She took the car and arrived at Ogden Place in three-
quarters of an hour, but decided to ride on to the West Side branch of
the Post-office, where she was accustomed to receive Hurstwood's
letters.  There was one there now, written Saturday, which she tore
open and read with mingled feelings. There was so much warmth in it and
such tense complaint at her having failed to meet him, and her
subsequent silence, that she rather pitied the man.  That he loved her
was evident enough. That he had wished and dared to do so, married as
he was, was the evil.  She felt as if the thing deserved an answer, and
consequently decided that she would write and let him know that she
knew of his married state and was justly incensed at his deception.
She would tell him that it was all over between them.

At her room, the wording of this missive occupied her for some time,
for she fell to the task at once.  It was most difficult.

"You do not need to have me explain why I did not meet you," she wrote
in part.  "How could you deceive me so? You cannot expect me to have
anything more to do with you.  I wouldn't under any circumstances.  Oh,
how could you act so?" she added in a burst of feeling.  "You have
caused me more misery than you can think. I hope you will get over your
infatuation for me.  We must not meet any more.  Good-bye."

 She took the letter the next morning, and at the corner dropped it
reluctantly into the letter-box, still uncertain as to whether she
should do so or not.  Then she took the car and went down town.

This was the dull season with the department stores, but she was
listened to with more consideration than was usually accorded to young
women applicants, owing to her neat and attractive appearance.  She was
asked the same old questions with which she was already familiar.

"What can you do? Have you ever worked in a retail store before? Are
you experienced?"

At The Fair, See and Company's, and all the great stores it was much
the same.  It was the dull season, she might come in a little later,
possibly they would like to have her.

When she arrived at the house at the end of the day, weary and
disheartened, she discovered that Drouet had been there.  His umbrella
and light overcoat were gone.  She thought she missed other things, but
could not be sure.  Everything had not been taken.

So his going was crystallizing into staying.  What was she to do now?
Evidently she would be facing the world in the same old way within a
day or two.  Her clothes would get poor.  She put her two hands
together in her customary expressive way and pressed her fingers.
Large tears gathered in her eyes and broke hot across her cheeks.  She
was alone, very much alone.

Drouet really had called, but it was with a very different mind from
that which Carrie had imagined.  He expected to find her, to justify
his return by claiming that he came to get the remaining portion of his
wardrobe, and before he got away again to patch up a peace.

Accordingly, when he arrived, he was disappointed to find Carrie out.
He trifled about, hoping that she was somewhere in the neighborhood and
would soon return.  He constantly listened, expecting to hear her foot
on the stair.

When he did so, it was his intention to make believe that he had just
come in and was disturbed at being caught.  Then he would explain his
need of his clothes and find out how things stood.

Wait as he did, however, Carrie did not come.  From pottering around
among the drawers, in momentary expectation of her arrival he changed
to looking out of the window, and from that to resting himself in the
rocking-chair.  Still no Carrie.  He began to grow restless and lit a
cigar.  After that he walked the floor.  Then he looked out of the
window and saw clouds gathering.  He remembered an appointment at
three.  He began to think that it would be useless to wait, and got
hold of his umbrella and light coat, intending to take these things,
any way.  It would scare her, he hoped.  To-morrow he would come back
for the others.  He would find out how things stood.

As he started to go he felt truly sorry that he had missed her. There
was a little picture of her on the wall, showing her arrayed in the
little jacket he had first bought her--her face a little more wistful
than he had seen it lately.  He was really touched by it, and looked
into the eyes of it with a rather rare feeling for him.

"You didn't do me right, Cad," he said, as if he were addressing her in
the flesh.

Then he went to the door, took a good look around and went out.




Chapter XXVII
WHEN WATERS ENGULF US WE REACH FOR A STAR

 It was when he returned from his disturbed stroll about the streets,
after receiving the decisive note from McGregor, James and Hay, that
Hurstwood found the letter Carrie had written him that morning.  He
thrilled intensely as he noted the handwriting, and rapidly tore it
open.

"Then," he thought, "she loves me or she would not have written to me
at all."

He was slightly depressed at the tenor of the note for the first few
minutes, but soon recovered.  "She wouldn't write at all if she didn't
care for me."

This was his one resource against the depression which held him. He
could extract little from the wording of the letter, but the spirit he
thought he knew.

There was really something exceedingly human--if not pathetic--in his
being thus relieved by a clearly worded reproof.  He who had for so
long remained satisfied with himself now looked outside of himself for
comfort--and to such a source.  The mystic cords of affection! How they
bind us all.

The color came to his cheeks.  For the moment he forgot the letter from
McGregor, James and Hay.  If he could only have Carrie, perhaps he
could get out of the whole entanglement-perhaps it would not matter.
He wouldn't care what his wife did with herself if only he might not
lose Carrie.  He stood up and walked about, dreaming his delightful
dream of a life continued with this lovely possessor of his heart.

It was not long, however, before the old worry was back for
consideration, and with it what weariness! He thought of the morrow and
the suit.  He had done nothing, and here was the afternoon slipping
away.  It was now a quarter of four.  At five the attorneys would have
gone home.  He still had the morrow until noon.  Even as he thought,
the last fifteen minutes passed away and it was five.  Then he
abandoned the thought of seeing them any more that day and turned to
Carrie.

It is to be observed that the man did not justify himself to himself.
He was not troubling about that.  His whole thought was the possibility
of persuading Carrie.  Nothing was wrong in that. He loved her dearly.
Their mutual happiness depended upon it. Would that Drouet were only
away!

While he was thinking thus elatedly, he remembered that he wanted some
clean linen in the morning.

This he purchased, together with a half-dozen ties, and went to the
Palmer House.  As he entered he thought he saw Drouet ascending the
stairs with a key.  Surely not Drouet! Then he thought, perhaps they
had changed their abode temporarily.  He went straight up to the desk.

"Is Mr. Drouet stopping here?" he asked of the clerk.

"I think he is," said the latter, consulting his private registry list.
"Yes."

"Is that so?" exclaimed Hurstwood, otherwise concealing his
astonishment.  "Alone?" he added.

"Yes," said the clerk.

Hurstwood turned away and set his lips so as best to express and
conceal his feelings.

"How's that?" he thought.  "They've had a row."

He hastened to his room with rising spirits and changed his linen.  As
he did so, he made up his mind that if Carrie was alone, or if she had
gone to another place, it behooved him to find out.  He decided to call
at once.

"I know what I'll do," he thought.  "I'll go to the door and ask if Mr.
Drouet is at home.  That will bring out whether he is there or not and
where Carrie is."

He was almost moved to some muscular display as he thought of it. He
decided to go immediately after supper.

On coming down from his room at six, he looked carefully about to see
if Drouet was present and then went out to lunch.  He could scarcely
eat, however, he was so anxious to be about his errand. Before starting
he thought it well to discover where Drouet would be, and returned to
his hotel.

"Has Mr. Drouet gone out?" he asked of the clerk.

"No," answered the latter, "he's in his room.  Do you wish to send up a
card?" "No, I'll call around later," answered Hurstwood, and strolled
out.

He took a Madison car and went direct to Ogden Place this time walking
boldly up to the door.  The chambermaid answered his knock.

"Is Mr. Drouet in?" said Hurstwood blandly.

"He is out of the city," said the girl, who had heard Carrie tell this
to Mrs. Hale.

"Is Mrs. Drouet in?"

"No, she has gone to the theatre."

"Is that so?" said Hurstwood, considerably taken back; then, as if
burdened with something important, "You don't know to which theatre?"

The girl really had no idea where she had gone, but not liking
Hurstwood, and wishing to cause him trouble, answered: "Yes, Hooley's."

"Thank you," returned the manager, and, tipping his hat slightly, went
away.

"I'll look in at Hooley's," thought he, but as a matter of fact he did
not.  Before he had reached the central portion of the city he thought
the whole matter over and decided it would be useless.  As much as he
longed to see Carrie, he knew she would be with some one and did not
wish to intrude with his plea there. A little later he might do so--in
the morning.  Only in the morning he had the lawyer question before
him.

This little pilgrimage threw quite a wet blanket upon his rising
spirits.  He was soon down again to his old worry, and reached the
resort anxious to find relief.  Quite a company of gentlemen were
making the place lively with their conversation.  A group of Cook
County politicians were conferring about a round cherry-wood table in
the rear portion of the room.  Several young merrymakers were
chattering at the bar before making a belated visit to the theatre.  A
shabbily-genteel individual, with a red nose and an old high hat, was
sipping a quiet glass of ale alone at one end of the bar.  Hurstwood
nodded to the politicians and went into his office.

About ten o'clock a friend of his, Mr. Frank L.  Taintor, a local sport
and racing man, dropped in, and seeing Hurstwood alone in his office
came to the door.

"Hello, George!" he exclaimed.

"How are you, Frank?" said Hurstwood, somewhat relieved by the sight of
him.  "Sit down," and he motioned him to one of the chairs in the
little room.

"What's the matter, George?" asked Taintor.  "You look a little glum.
Haven't lost at the track, have you?"

"I'm not feeling very well to-night.  I had a slight cold the other
day."

"Take whiskey, George," said Taintor.  "You ought to know that."

Hurstwood smiled.

While they were still conferring there, several other of Hurstwood's
friends entered, and not long after eleven, the theatres being out,
some actors began to drop in--among them some notabilities.

Then began one of those pointless social conversations so common in
American resorts where the would-be gilded attempt to rub off gilt from
those who have it in abundance.  If Hurstwood had one leaning, it was
toward notabilities.  He considered that, if anywhere, he belonged
among them.  He was too proud to toady, too keen not to strictly
observe the plane he occupied when there were those present who did not
appreciate him, but, in situations like the present, where he could
shine as a gentleman and be received without equivocation as a friend
and equal among men of known ability, he was most delighted.  It was on
such occasions, if ever, that he would "take something."  When the
social flavor was strong enough he would even unbend to the extent of
drinking glass for glass with his associates, punctiliously observing
his turn to pay as if he were an outsider like the others.  If he ever
approached intoxication--or rather that ruddy warmth and
comfortableness which precedes the more slovenly state--it was when
individuals such as these were gathered about him, when he was one of a
circle of chatting celebrities.  To-night, disturbed as was his state,
he was rather relieved to find company, and now that notabilities were
gathered, he laid aside his troubles for the nonce, and joined in right
heartily.

It was not long before the imbibing began to tell.  Stories began to
crop up--those ever-enduring, droll stories which form the major
portion of the conversation among American men under such
circumstances.

Twelve o'clock arrived, the hour for closing, and with it the company
took leave.  Hurstwood shook hands with them most cordially.  He was
very roseate physically.  He had arrived at that state where his mind,
though clear, was, nevertheless, warm in its fancies.  He felt as if
his troubles were not very serious.  Going into his office, he began to
turn over certain accounts, awaiting the departure of the bartenders
and the cashier, who soon left.

It was the manager's duty, as well as his custom, after all were gone
to see that everything was safely closed up for the night. As a rule,
no money except the cash taken in after banking hours was kept about
the place, and that was locked in the safe by the cashier, who, with
the owners, was joint keeper of the secret combination, but,
nevertheless, Hurstwood nightly took the precaution to try the cash
drawers and the safe in order to see that they were tightly closed.
Then he would lock his own little office and set the proper light
burning near the safe, after which he would take his departure.

Never in his experience had he found anything out of order, but to-
night, after shutting down his desk, he came out and tried the safe.
His way was to give a sharp pull.  This time the door responded.  He
was slightly surprised at that, and looking in found the money cases as
left for the day, apparently unprotected.  His first thought was, of
course, to inspect the drawers and shut the door.

"I'll speak to Mayhew about this to-morrow," he thought.

The latter had certainly imagined upon going out a half-hour before
that he had turned the knob on the door so as to spring the lock.  He
had never failed to do so before.  But to-night Mayhew had other
thoughts.  He had been revolving the problem of a business of his own.

"I'll look in here," thought the manager, pulling out the money
drawers.  He did not know why he wished to look in there.  It was quite
a superfluous action, which another time might not have happened at
all.

As he did so, a layer of bills, in parcels of a thousand, such as banks
issue, caught his eye.  He could not tell how much they represented,
but paused to view them.  Then he pulled out the second of the cash
drawers.  In that were the receipts of the day.

"I didn't know Fitzgerald and Moy ever left any money this way," his
mind said to itself.  "They must have forgotten it."

He looked at the other drawer and paused again.

"Count them," said a voice in his ear.

He put his hand into the first of the boxes and lifted the stack,
letting the separate parcels fall.  They were bills of fifty and one
hundred dollars done in packages of a thousand.  He thought he counted
ten such.

"Why don't I shut the safe?" his mind said to itself, lingering. "What
makes me pause here?"

For answer there came the strangest words:

"Did you ever have ten thousand dollars in ready money?"

Lo, the manager remembered that he had never had so much.  All his
property had been slowly accumulated, and now his wife owned that.  He
was worth more than forty thousand, all told--but she would get that.

He puzzled as he thought of these things, then pushed in the drawers
and closed the door, pausing with his hand upon the knob, which might
so easily lock it all beyond temptation.  Still he paused.  Finally he
went to the windows and pulled down the curtains.  Then he tried the
door, which he had previously locked.  What was this thing, making him
suspicious? Why did he wish to move about so quietly.  He came back to
the end of the counter as if to rest his arm and think.  Then he went
and unlocked his little office door and turned on the light.  He also
opened his desk, sitting down before it, only to think strange
thoughts.

"The safe is open," said a voice.  "There is just the least little
crack in it.  The lock has not been sprung."

The manager floundered among a jumble of thoughts.  Now all the
entanglement of the day came back.  Also the thought that here was a
solution.  That money would do it.  If he had that and Carrie.  He rose
up and stood stock-still, looking at the floor.

"What about it?" his mind asked, and for answer he put his hand slowly
up and scratched his head.

The manager was no fool to be led blindly away by such an errant
proposition as this, but his situation was peculiar.  Wine was in his
veins.  It had crept up into his head and given him a warm view of the
situation.  It also colored the possibilities of ten thousand for him.
He could see great opportunities with that. He could get Carrie.  Oh,
yes, he could! He could get rid of his wife.  That letter, too, was
waiting discussion to-morrow morning.  He would not need to answer
that.  He went back to the safe and put his hand on the knob.  Then he
pulled the door open and took the drawer with the money quite out.

With it once out and before him, it seemed a foolish thing to think
about leaving it.  Certainly it would.  Why, he could live quietly with
Carrie for years.

Lord! what was that? For the first time he was tense, as if a stern
hand had been laid upon his shoulder.  He looked fearfully around.  Not
a soul was present.  Not a sound.  Some one was shuffling by on the
sidewalk.  He took the box and the money and put it back in the safe.
Then he partly closed the door again.

To those who have never wavered in conscience, the predicament of the
individual whose mind is less strongly constituted and who trembles in
the balance between duty and desire is scarcely appreciable, unless
graphically portrayed.  Those who have never heard that solemn voice of
the ghostly clock which ticks with awful distinctness, "thou shalt,"
"thou shalt not," "thou shalt," "thou shalt not," are in no position to
judge.  Not alone in sensitive, highly organized natures is such a
mental conflict possible.  The dullest specimen of humanity, when drawn
by desire toward evil, is recalled by a sense of right, which is
proportionate in power and strength to his evil tendency.  We must
remember that it may not be a knowledge of right, for no knowledge of
right is predicated of the animal's instinctive recoil at evil.  Men
are still led by instinct before they are regulated by knowledge.  It
is instinct which recalls the criminal--it is instinct (where highly
organized reasoning is absent) which gives the criminal his feeling of
danger, his fear of wrong.

At every first adventure, then, into some untried evil, the mind
wavers.  The clock of thought ticks out its wish and its denial. To
those who have never experienced such a mental dilemma, the following
will appeal on the simple ground of revelation.

When Hurstwood put the money back, his nature again resumed its ease
and daring.  No one had observed him.  He was quite alone. No one could
tell what he wished to do.  He could work this thing out for himself.

The imbibation of the evening had not yet worn off.  Moist as was his
brow, tremble as did his hand once after the nameless fright, he was
still flushed with the fumes of liquor.  He scarcely noticed that the
time was passing.  He went over his situation once again, his eye
always seeing the money in a lump, his mind always seeing what it would
do.  He strolled into his little room, then to the door, then to the
safe again.  He put his hand on the knob and opened it.  There was the
money! Surely no harm could come from looking at it!

He took out the drawer again and lifted the bills.  They were so
smooth, so compact, so portable.  How little they made, after all.  He
decided he would take them.  Yes, he would.  He would put them in his
pocket.  Then he looked at that and saw they would not go there.  His
hand satchel! To be sure, his hand satchel.  They would go in that--all
of it would.  No one would think anything of it either.  He went into
the little office and took it from the shelf in the corner.  Now he set
it upon his desk and went out toward the safe.  For some reason he did
not want to fill it out in the big room. First he brought the bills and
then the loose receipts of the day.  He would take it all.  He put the
empty drawers back and pushed the iron door almost to, then stood
beside it meditating.

The wavering of a mind under such circumstances is an almost
inexplicable thing, and yet it is absolutely true.  Hurstwood could not
bring himself to act definitely.  He wanted to think about it--to
ponder over it, to decide whether it were best.  He was drawn by such a
keen desire for Carrie, driven by such a state of turmoil in his own
affairs that he thought constantly it would be best, and yet he
wavered.  He did not know what evil might result from it to him--how
soon he might come to grief. The true ethics of the situation never
once occurred to him, and never would have, under any circumstances.

After he had all the money in the handbag, a revulsion of feeling
seized him.  He would not do it--no! Think of what a scandal it would
make.  The police! They would be after him.  He would have to fly, and
where? Oh, the terror of being a fugitive from justice! He took out the
two boxes and put all the money back. In his excitement he forgot what
he was doing, and put the sums in the wrong boxes.  As he pushed the
door to, he thought he remembered doing it wrong and opened the door
again.  There were the two boxes mixed.

He took them out and straightened the matter, but now the terror had
gone.  Why be afraid?

While the money was in his hand the lock clicked.  It had sprung! Did
he do it? He grabbed at the knob and pulled vigorously.  It had closed.
Heavens! he was in for it now, sure enough.

The moment he realized that the safe was locked for a surety, the sweat
burst out upon his brow and he trembled violently.  He looked about him
and decided instantly.  There was no delaying now.

"Supposing I do lay it on the top," he said, "and go away, they'll know
who took it.  I'm the last to close up.  Besides, other things will
happen."

At once he became the man of action.

"I must get out of this," he thought.

He hurried into his little room, took down his light overcoat and hat,
locked his desk, and grabbed the satchel.  Then he turned out all but
one light and opened the door.  He tried to put on his old assured air,
but it was almost gone.  He was repenting rapidly.

"I wish I hadn't done that," he said.  "That was a mistake."

He walked steadily down the street, greeting a night watchman whom he
knew who was trying doors.  He must get out of the city, and that
quickly.

"I wonder how the trains run?" he thought.

Instantly he pulled out his watch and looked.  It was nearly half-past
one.

At the first drugstore he stopped, seeing a long-distance telephone
booth inside.  It was a famous drugstore, and contained one of the
first private telephone booths ever erected. "I want to use your 'phone
a minute," he said to the night clerk.

The latter nodded.

"Give me 1643," he called to Central, after looking up the Michigan
Central depot number.  Soon he got the ticket agent.

"How do the trains leave here for Detroit?" he asked.

The man explained the hours.

"No more to-night?"

"Nothing with a sleeper.  Yes, there is, too," he added.  "There is a
mail train out of here at three o'clock."

"All right," said Hurstwood.  "What time does that get to Detroit?"

He was thinking if he could only get there and cross the river into
Canada, he could take his time about getting to Montreal. He was
relieved to learn that it would reach there by noon.

"Mayhew won't open the safe till nine," he thought.  "They can't get on
my track before noon."

Then he thought of Carrie.  With what speed must he get her, if he got
her at all.  She would have to come along.  He jumped into the nearest
cab standing by.

"To Ogden Place," he said sharply.  "I'll give you a dollar more if you
make good time."

The cabby beat his horse into a sort of imitation gallop which was
fairly fast, however.  On the way Hurstwood thought what to do.
Reaching the number, he hurried up the steps and did not spare the bell
in waking the servant.

"Is Mrs. Drouet in?" he asked.

"Yes," said the astonished girl.

"Tell her to dress and come to the door at once.  Her husband is in the
hospital, injured, and wants to see her."

The servant girl hurried upstairs, convinced by the man's strained and
emphatic manner.

"What!" said Carrie, lighting the gas and searching for her clothes.

"Mr. Drouet is hurt and in the hospital.  He wants to see you. The
cab's downstairs."

Carrie dressed very rapidly, and soon appeared below, forgetting
everything save the necessities.

"Drouet is hurt," said Hurstwood quickly.  "He wants to see you. Come
quickly."

Carrie was so bewildered that she swallowed the whole story.

"Get in," said Hurstwood, helping her and jumping after.

The cabby began to turn the horse around. "Michigan Central depot," he
said, standing up and speaking so low that Carrie could not hear, "as
fast as you can go."




Chapter XXVIII
A PILGRIM, AN OUTLAW--THE SPIRIT DETAINED

 The cab had not traveled a short block before Carrie, settling herself
and thoroughly waking in the night atmosphere, asked:

"What's the matter with him? Is he hurt badly?"

"It isn't anything very serious," Hurstwood said solemnly.  He was very
much disturbed over his own situation, and now that he had Carrie with
him, he only wanted to get safely out of reach of the law.  Therefore
he was in no mood for anything save such words as would further his
plans distinctly.

Carrie did not forget that there was something to be settled between
her and Hurstwood, but the thought was ignored in her agitation.  The
one thing was to finish this strange pilgrimage.

"Where is he?"

"Way out on the South Side," said Hurstwood.  "We'll have to take the
train.  It's the quickest way."

Carrie said nothing, and the horse gamboled on.  The weirdness of the
city by night held her attention.  She looked at the long receding rows
of lamps and studied the dark, silent houses.

"How did he hurt himself?" she asked--meaning what was the nature of
his injuries.  Hurstwood understood.  He hated to lie any more than
necessary, and yet he wanted no protests until he was out of danger.

"I don't know exactly," he said.  "They just called me up to go and get
you and bring you out.  They said there wasn't any need for alarm, but
that I shouldn't fail to bring you."

The man's serious manner convinced Carrie, and she became silent,
wondering.

Hurstwood examined his watch and urged the man to hurry.  For one in so
delicate a position he was exceedingly cool.  He could only think of
how needful it was to make the train and get quietly away.  Carrie
seemed quite tractable, and he congratulated himself.

In due time they reached the depot, and after helping her out he handed
the man a five-dollar bill and hurried on.

"You wait here," he said to Carrie, when they reached the waiting-room,
"while I get the tickets."

"Have I much time to catch that train for Detroit?" he asked of the
agent.

"Four minutes," said the latter.

He paid for two tickets as circumspectly as possible.

"Is it far?" said Carrie, as he hurried back.

"Not very," he said.  "We must get right in."

He pushed her before him at the gate, stood between her and the ticket
man while the latter punched their tickets, so that she could not see,
and then hurried after.

There was a long line of express and passenger cars and one or two
common day coaches.  As the train had only recently been made up and
few passengers were expected, there were only one or two brakemen
waiting.  They entered the rear day coach and sat down. Almost
immediately, "All aboard," resounded faintly from the outside, and the
train started.

Carrie began to think it was a little bit curious--this going to a
depot--but said nothing.  The whole incident was so out of the natural
that she did not attach too much weight to anything she imagined.

"How have you been?" asked Hurstwood gently, for he now breathed
easier.

"Very well," said Carrie, who was so disturbed that she could not bring
a proper attitude to bear in the matter.  She was still nervous to
reach Drouet and see what could be the matter. Hurstwood contemplated
her and felt this.  He was not disturbed that it should be so.  He did
not trouble because she was moved sympathetically in the matter.  It
was one of the qualities in her which pleased him exceedingly.  He was
only thinking how he should explain.  Even this was not the most
serious thing in his mind, however.  His own deed and present flight
were the great shadows which weighed upon him.

"What a fool I was to do that," he said over and over.  "What a
mistake!"

In his sober senses, he could scarcely realize that the thing had been
done.  He could not begin to feel that he was a fugitive from justice.
He had often read of such things, and had thought they must be
terrible, but now that the thing was upon him, he only sat and looked
into the past.  The future was a thing which concerned the Canadian
line.  He wanted to reach that.  As for the rest he surveyed his
actions for the evening, and counted them parts of a great mistake.

"Still," he said, "what could I have done?"

Then he would decide to make the best of it, and would begin to do so
by starting the whole inquiry over again.  It was a fruitless,
harassing round, and left him in a queer mood to deal with the
proposition he had in the presence of Carrie.

The train clacked through the yards along the lake front, and ran
rather slowly to Twenty-fourth Street.  Brakes and signals were visible
without.  The engine gave short calls with its whistle, and frequently
the bell rang.  Several brakemen came through, bearing lanterns.  They
were locking the vestibules and putting the cars in order for a long
run.

Presently it began to gain speed, and Carrie saw the silent streets
flashing by in rapid succession.  The engine also began its whistle-
calls of four parts, with which it signaled danger to important
crossings.

"Is it very far?" asked Carrie. "Not so very," said Hurstwood.  He
could hardly repress a smile at her simplicity.  He wanted to explain
and conciliate her, but he also wanted to be well out of Chicago.

In the lapse of another half-hour it became apparent to Carrie that it
was quite a run to wherever he was taking her, anyhow.

"Is it in Chicago?" she asked nervously.  They were now far beyond the
city limits, and the train was scudding across the Indiana line at a
great rate.

"No," he said, "not where we are going."

There was something in the way he said this which aroused her in an
instant.

Her pretty brow began to contract.

"We are going to see Charlie, aren't we?" she asked.

He felt that the time was up.  An explanation might as well come now as
later.  Therefore, he shook his head in the most gentle negative.

"What?" said Carrie.  She was nonplussed at the possibility of the
errand being different from what she had thought.

He only looked at her in the most kindly and mollifying way.

"Well, where are you taking me, then?" she asked, her voice showing the
quality of fright.

"I'll tell you, Carrie, if you'll be quiet.  I want you to come along
with me to another city,"

"Oh," said Carrie, her voice rising into a weak cry.  "Let me off.  I
don't want to go with you."

She was quite appalled at the man's audacity.  This was something which
had never for a moment entered her head.  Her one thought now was to
get off and away.  If only the flying train could be stopped, the
terrible trick would be amended.

She arose and tried to push out into the aisle--anywhere.  She knew she
had to do something.  Hurstwood laid a gentle hand on her.

"Sit still, Carrie," he said.  "Sit still.  It won't do you any good to
get up here.  Listen to me and I'll tell you what I'll do.  Wait a
moment."

She was pushing at his knees, but he only pulled her back.  No one saw
this little altercation, for very few persons were in the car, and they
were attempting to doze.

"I won't," said Carrie, who was, nevertheless, complying against her
will.  "Let me go," she said.  "How dare you?" and large tears began to
gather in her eyes.

Hurstwood was now fully aroused to the immediate difficulty, and ceased
to think of his own situation.  He must do something with this girl, or
she would cause him trouble.  He tried the art of persuasion with all
his powers aroused.

"Look here now, Carrie," he said, "you mustn't act this way.  I didn't
mean to hurt your feelings.  I don't want to do anything to make you
feel bad."

"Oh," sobbed Carrie, "oh, oh--oo--o!"

"There, there," he said, "you mustn't cry.  Won't you listen to me?
Listen to me a minute, and I'll tell you why I came to do this thing.
I couldn't help it.  I assure you I couldn't.  Won't you listen?"

Her sobs disturbed him so that he was quite sure she did not hear a
word he said.

"Won't you listen?" he asked.

"No, I won't," said Carrie, flashing up.  "I want you to take me out of
this, or I'll tell the conductor.  I won't go with you. It's a shame,"
and again sobs of fright cut off her desire for expression.

Hurstwood listened with some astonishment.  He felt that she had just
cause for feeling as she did, and yet he wished that he could
straighten this thing out quickly.  Shortly the conductor would come
through for the tickets.  He wanted no noise, no trouble of any kind.
Before everything he must make her quiet.

"You couldn't get out until the train stops again," said Hurstwood.
"It won't be very long until we reach another station.  You can get out
then if you want to.  I won't stop you. All I want you to do is to
listen a moment.  You'll let me tell you, won't you?"

Carrie seemed not to listen.  She only turned her head toward the
window, where outside all was black.  The train was speeding with
steady grace across the fields and through patches of wood.  The long
whistles came with sad, musical effect as the lonely woodland crossings
were approached.

Now the conductor entered the car and took up the one or two fares that
had been added at Chicago.  He approached Hurstwood, who handed out the
tickets.  Poised as she was to act, Carrie made no move.  She did not
look about.

When the conductor had gone again Hurstwood felt relieved.

"You're angry at me because I deceived you," he said.  "I didn't mean
to, Carrie.  As I live I didn't.  I couldn't help it.  I couldn't stay
away from you after the first time I saw you."

He was ignoring the last deception as something that might go by the
board.  He wanted to convince her that his wife could no longer be a
factor in their relationship.  The money he had stolen he tried to shut
out of his mind.

"Don't talk to me," said Carrie, "I hate you.  I want you to go away
from me.  I am going to get out at the very next station."

She was in a tremble of excitement and opposition as she spoke.

"All right," he said, "but you'll hear me out, won't you? After all you
have said about loving me, you might hear me.  I don't want to do you
any harm.  I'll give you the money to go back with when you go.  I
merely want to tell you, Carrie.  You can't stop me from loving you,
whatever you may think."

He looked at her tenderly, but received no reply. "You think I have
deceived you badly, but I haven't.  I didn't do it willingly.  I'm
through with my wife.  She hasn't any claims on me.  I'll never see her
any more.  That's why I'm here tonight.  That's why I came and got
you."

"You said Charlie was hurt," said Carrie, savagely.  "You deceived me.
You've been deceiving me all the time, and now you want to force me to
run away with you."

She was so excited that she got up and tried to get by him again. He
let her, and she took another seat.  Then he followed.

"Don't run away from me, Carrie," he said gently.  "Let me explain.  If
you will only hear me out you will see where I stand.  I tell you my
wife is nothing to me.  She hasn't been anything for years or I
wouldn't have ever come near you.  I'm going to get a divorce just as
soon as I can.  I'll never see her again.  I'm done with all that.
You're the only person I want. If I can have you I won't ever think of
another woman again."

Carrie heard all this in a very ruffled state.  It sounded sincere
enough, however, despite all he had done.  There was a tenseness in
Hurstwood's voice and manner which could but have some effect.  She did
not want anything to do with him.  He was married, he had deceived her
once, and now again, and she thought him terrible.  Still there is
something in such daring and power which is fascinating to a woman,
especially if she can be made to feel that it is all prompted by love
of her.

The progress of the train was having a great deal to do with the
solution of this difficult situation.  The speeding wheels and
disappearing country put Chicago farther and farther behind. Carrie
could feel that she was being borne a long distance off-that the engine
was making an almost through run to some distant city.  She felt at
times as if she could cry out and make such a row that some one would
come to her aid; at other times it seemed an almost useless thing--so
far was she from any aid, no matter what she did.  All the while
Hurstwood was endeavoring to formulate his plea in such a way that it
would strike home and bring her into sympathy with him.

"I was simply put where I didn't know what else to do."

Carrie deigned no suggestion of hearing this.

"When I say you wouldn't come unless I could marry you, I decided to
put everything else behind me and get you to come away with me.  I'm
going off now to another city.  I want to go to Montreal for a while,
and then anywhere you want to.  We'll go and live in New York, if you
say."

"I'll not have anything to do with you," said Carrie.  "I want to get
off this train.  Where are we going?"

"To Detroit," said Hurstwood.

"Oh!" said Carrie, in a burst of anguish.  So distant and definite a
point seemed to increase the difficulty.

"Won't you come along with me?" he said, as if there was great danger
that she would not.  "You won't need to do anything but travel with me.
I'll not trouble you in any way.  You can see Montreal and New York,
and then if you don't want to stay you can go back.  It will be better
than trying to go back to-night."

The first gleam of fairness shone in this proposition for Carrie. It
seemed a plausible thing to do, much as she feared his opposition if
she tried to carry it out.  Montreal and New York! Even now she was
speeding toward those great, strange lands, and could see them if she
liked.  She thought, but made no sign.

Hurstwood thought he saw a shade of compliance in this.  He redoubled
his ardor.

"Think," he said, "what I've given up.  I can't go back to Chicago any
more.  I've got to stay away and live alone now, if you don't come with
me.  You won't go back on me entirely, will you, Carrie?"

"I don't want you to talk to me," she answered forcibly.

Hurstwood kept silent for a while.

Carrie felt the train to be slowing down.  It was the moment to act if
she was to act at all.  She stirred uneasily.

"Don't think of going, Carrie," he said.  "If you ever cared for me at
all, come along and let's start right.  I'll do whatever you say.  I'll
marry you, or I'll let you go back.  Give yourself time to think it
over.  I wouldn't have wanted you to come if I hadn't loved you.  I
tell you, Carrie, before God, I can't live without you.  I won't!"

There was the tensity of fierceness in the man's plea which appealed
deeply to her sympathies.  It was a dissolving fire which was actuating
him now.  He was loving her too intensely to think of giving her up in
this, his hour of distress.  He clutched her hand nervously and pressed
it with all the force of an appeal.

The train was now all but stopped.  It was running by some cars on a
side track.  Everything outside was dark and dreary.  A few sprinkles
on the window began to indicate that it was raining. Carrie hung in a
quandary, balancing between decision and helplessness.  Now the train
stopped, and she was listening to his plea.  The engine backed a few
feet and all was still.

She wavered, totally unable to make a move.  Minute after minute
slipped by and still she hesitated, he pleading.

"Will you let me come back if I want to?" she asked, as if she now had
the upper hand and her companion was utterly subdued.

"Of course," he answered, "you know I will."

Carrie only listened as one who has granted a temporary amnesty. She
began to feel as if the matter were in her hands entirely.

The train was again in rapid motion.  Hurstwood changed the subject.

"Aren't you very tired?" he said.

"No," she answered.

"Won't you let me get you a berth in the sleeper?"

She shook her head, though for all her distress and his trickery she
was beginning to notice what she had always felt--his thoughtfulness.

"Oh, yes," he said, "you will feel so much better."

She shook her head.

"Let me fix my coat for you, anyway," and he arose and arranged his
light coat in a comfortable position to receive her head.

"There," he said tenderly, "now see if you can't rest a little." He
could have kissed her for her compliance.  He took his seat beside her
and thought a moment.

"I believe we're in for a heavy rain," he said.

"So it looks," said Carrie, whose nerves were quieting under the sound
of the rain drops, driven by a gusty wind, as the train swept on
frantically through the shadow to a newer world.

The fact that he had in a measure mollified Carrie was a source of
satisfaction to Hurstwood, but it furnished only the most temporary
relief.  Now that her opposition was out of the way, he had all of his
time to devote to the consideration of his own error.

His condition was bitter in the extreme, for he did not want the
miserable sum he had stolen.  He did not want to be a thief. That sum
or any other could never compensate for the state which he had thus
foolishly doffed.  It could not give him back his host of friends, his
name, his house and family, nor Carrie, as he had meant to have her.
He was shut out from Chicago--from his easy, comfortable state.  He had
robbed himself of his dignity, his merry meetings, his pleasant
evenings.  And for what? The more he thought of it the more unbearable
it became.  He began to think that he would try and restore himself to
his old state.  He would return the miserable thievings of the night
and explain. Perhaps Moy would understand.  Perhaps they would forgive
him and let him come back.

By noontime the train rolled into Detroit and he began to feel
exceedingly nervous.  The police must be on his track by now. They had
probably notified all the police of the big cities, and detectives
would be watching for him.  He remembered instances in which defaulters
had been captured.  Consequently, he breathed heavily and paled
somewhat.  His hands felt as if they must have something to do.  He
simulated interest in several scenes without which he did not feel.  He
repeatedly beat his foot upon the floor.

Carrie noticed his agitation, but said nothing.  She had no idea what
it meant or that it was important.

He wondered now why he had not asked whether this train went on through
to Montreal or some Canadian point.  Perhaps he could have saved time.
He jumped up and sought the conductor.

"Does any part of this train go to Montreal?" he asked.

"Yes, the next sleeper back does."

He would have asked more, but it did not seem wise, so he decided to
inquire at the depot.

The train rolled into the yards, clanging and puffing.

"I think we had better go right on through to Montreal," he said to
Carrie.  "I'll see what the connections are when we get off."

He was exceedingly nervous, but did his best to put on a calm exterior.
Carrie only looked at him with large, troubled eyes. She was drifting
mentally, unable to say to herself what to do.

The train stopped and Hurstwood led the way out.  He looked warily
around him, pretending to look after Carrie.  Seeing nothing that
indicated studied observation, he made his way to the ticket office.

"The next train for Montreal leaves when?" he asked.

"In twenty minutes," said the man.

He bought two tickets and Pullman berths.  Then he hastened back to
Carrie.

"We go right out again," he said, scarcely noticing that Carrie looked
tired and weary.

"I wish I was out of all this," she exclaimed gloomily.

"You'll feel better when we reach Montreal," he said.

"I haven't an earthly thing with me," said Carrie; "not even a
handkerchief."

"You can buy all you want as soon as you get there, dearest," he
explained.  "You can call in a dressmaker."

Now the crier called the train ready and they got on.  Hurstwood
breathed a sigh of relief as it started.  There was a short run to the
river, and there they were ferried over.  They had barely pulled the
train off the ferry-boat when he settled back with a sigh.

"It won't be so very long now," he said, remembering her in his relief.
"We get there the first thing in the morning."

Carrie scarcely deigned to reply.

"I'll see if there is a dining-car," he added.  "I'm hungry."




Chapter XXIX
THE SOLACE OF TRAVEL--THE BOATS OF THE SEA

 To the untraveled, territory other than their own familiar heath is
invariably fascinating.  Next to love, it is the one thing which
solaces and delights.  Things new are too important to be neglected,
and mind, which is a mere reflection of sensory impressions, succumbs
to the flood of objects.  Thus lovers are forgotten, sorrows laid
aside, death hidden from view.  There is a world of accumulated feeling
back of the trite dramatic expression--"I am going away."

As Carrie looked out upon the flying scenery she almost forgot that she
had been tricked into this long journey against her will and that she
was without the necessary apparel for traveling. She quite forgot
Hurstwood's presence at times, and looked away to homely farmhouses and
cozy cottages in villages with wondering eyes.  It was an interesting
world to her.  Her life had just begun.  She did not feel herself
defeated at all. Neither was she blasted in hope.  The great city held
much. Possibly she would come out of bondage into freedom--who knows?
Perhaps she would be happy.  These thoughts raised her above the level
of erring.  She was saved in that she was hopeful.

The following morning the train pulled safely into Montreal and they
stepped down, Hurstwood glad to be out of danger, Carrie wondering at
the novel atmosphere of the northern city.  Long before, Hurstwood had
been here, and now he remembered the name of the hotel at which he had
stopped.  As they came out of the main entrance of the depot he heard
it called anew by a busman.

"We'll go right up and get rooms," he said.

At the clerk's office Hurstwood swung the register about while the
clerk came forward.  He was thinking what name he would put down.  With
the latter before him he found no time for hesitation.  A name he had
seen out of the car window came swiftly to him.  It was pleasing
enough.  With an easy hand he wrote, "G. W. Murdock and wife." It was
the largest concession to necessity he felt like making.  His initials
he could not spare.

When they were shown their room Carrie saw at once that he had secured
her a lovely chamber.

"You have a bath there," said he.  "Now you can clean up when you get
ready."

Carrie went over and looked out the window, while Hurstwood looked at
himself in the glass.  He felt dusty and unclean.  He had no trunk, no
change of linen, not even a hair-brush.

"I'll ring for soap and towels," he said, "and send you up a hair-
brush.  Then you can bathe and get ready for breakfast. I'll go for a
shave and come back and get you, and then we'll go out and look for
some clothes for you."

He smiled good-naturedly as he said this.

"All right," said Carrie.

She sat down in one of the rocking-chairs, while Hurstwood waited for
the boy, who soon knocked.

"Soap, towels, and a pitcher of ice-water."

"Yes, sir."

"I'll go now," he said to Carrie, coming toward her and holding out his
hands, but she did not move to take them.

"You're not mad at me, are you?" he asked softly.

"Oh, no!" she answered, rather indifferently.

"Don't you care for me at all?"

She made no answer, but looked steadily toward the window.

"Don't you think you could love me a little?" he pleaded, taking one of
her hands, which she endeavored to draw away.  "You once said you did."

"What made you deceive me so?" asked Carrie.

"I couldn't help it," he said, "I wanted you too much."

"You didn't have any right to want me," she answered, striking cleanly
home.

"Oh, well, Carrie," he answered, "here I am.  It's too late now. Won't
you try and care for me a little?"

He looked rather worsted in thought as he stood before her.

She shook her head negatively.

"Let me start all over again.  Be my wife from to-day on."

Carrie rose up as if to step away, he holding her hand.  Now he slipped
his arm about her and she struggled, but in vain.  He held her quite
close.  Instantly there flamed up in his body the all compelling
desire.  His affection took an ardent form.

"Let me go," said Carrie, who was folded close to him.

"Won't you love me?" he said.  "Won't you be mine from now on?"

Carrie had never been ill-disposed toward him.  Only a moment before
she had been listening with some complacency, remembering her old
affection for him.  He was so handsome, so daring!

Now, however, this feeling had changed to one of opposition, which rose
feebly.  It mastered her for a moment, and then, held close as she was,
began to wane.  Something else in her spoke. This man, to whose bosom
she was being pressed, was strong; he was passionate, he loved her, and
she was alone.  If she did not turn to him--accept of his love--where
else might she go? Her resistance half dissolved in the flood of his
strong feeling.

She found him lifting her head and looking into her eyes.  What
magnetism there was she could never know.  His many sins, however, were
for the moment all forgotten.

He pressed her closer and kissed her, and she felt that further
opposition was useless.

"Will you marry me?" she asked, forgetting how.

"This very day," he said, with all delight.

Now the hall-boy pounded on the door and he released his hold upon her
regretfully.

"You get ready now, will you," he said, "at once?"

"Yes," she answered.

"I'll be back in three-quarters of an hour."

Carrie, flushed and excited, moved away as he admitted the boy.

Below stairs, he halted in the lobby to look for a barber shop. For the
moment, he was in fine feather.  His recent victory over Carrie seemed
to atone for much he had endured during the last few days.  Life seemed
worth fighting for.  This eastward flight from all things customary and
attached seemed as if it might have happiness in store.  The storm
showed a rainbow at the end of which might be a pot of gold.

He was about to cross to a little red-and-white striped bar which was
fastened up beside a door when a voice greeted him familiarly.
Instantly his heart sank. "Why, hello, George, old man!" said the
voice.  "What are you doing down here?"

Hurstwood was already confronted, and recognized his friend Kenny, the
stock-broker.

"Just attending to a little private matter," he answered, his mind
working like a key-board of a telephone station.  This man evidently
did not know--he had not read the papers.

"Well, it seems strange to see you way up here," said Mr. Kenny
genially.  "Stopping here?"

"Yes," said Hurstwood uneasily, thinking of his handwriting on the
register.

"Going to be in town long?"

"No, only a day or so."

"Is that so? Had your breakfast?"

"Yes," said Hurstwood, lying blandly.  "I'm just going for a shave."

"Won't you come have a drink?"

"Not until afterwards," said the ex-manager.  "I'll see you later.  Are
you stopping here?"

"Yes," said Mr. Kenny, and then, turning the word again added: "How are
things out in Chicago?"

"About the same as usual," said Hurstwood, smiling genially.

"Wife with you?"

"No."

"Well, I must see more of you to-day.  I'm just going in here for
breakfast.  Come in when you're through."

"I will," said Hurstwood, moving away.  The whole conversation was a
trial to him.  It seemed to add complications with very word.  This man
called up a thousand memories.  He represented everything he had left.
Chicago, his wife, the elegant resort-all these were in his greeting
and inquiries.  And here he was in this same hotel expecting to confer
with him, unquestionably waiting to have a good time with him.  All at
once the Chicago papers would arrive.  The local papers would have
accounts in them this very day.  He forgot his triumph with Carrie in
the possibility of soon being known for what he was, in this man's
eyes, a safe-breaker.  He could have groaned as he went into the barber
shop.  He decided to escape and seek a more secluded hotel.

Accordingly, when he came out he was glad to see the lobby clear, and
hastened toward the stairs.  He would get Carrie and go out by the
ladies' entrance.  They would have breakfast in some more inconspicuous
place.

Across the lobby, however, another individual was surveying him. He was
of a commonplace Irish type, small of stature, cheaply dressed, and
with a head that seemed a smaller edition of some huge ward
politician's.  This individual had been evidently talking with the
clerk, but now he surveyed the ex-manager keenly.

Hurstwood felt the long-range examination and recognized the type.
Instinctively he felt that the man was a detective--that he was being
watched.  He hurried across, pretending not to notice, but in his mind
was a world of thoughts.  What would happen now? What could these
people do? He began to trouble concerning the extradition laws.  He did
not understand them absolutely.  Perhaps he could be arrested.  Oh, if
Carrie should find out! Montreal was too warm for him.  He began to
long to be out of it.

Carrie had bathed and was waiting when he arrived.  She looked
refreshed--more delightful than ever, but reserved.  Since he had gone
she had resumed somewhat of her cold attitude towards him. Love was not
blazing in her heart.  He felt it, and his troubles seemed increased.
He could not take her in his arms; he did not even try.  Something
about her forbade it.  In part his opinion was the result of his own
experiences and reflections below stairs.

"You're ready, are you?" he said kindly.

"Yes," she answered.

"We'll go out for breakfast.  This place down here doesn't appeal to me
very much."

"All right," said Carrie.

They went out, and at the corner the commonplace Irish individual was
standing, eyeing him.  Hurstwood could scarcely refrain from showing
that he knew of this chap's presence.  The insolence in the fellow's
eye was galling.  Still they passed, and he explained to Carrie
concerning the city.  Another restaurant was not long in showing
itself, and here they entered.

"What a queer town this is," said Carrie, who marveled at it solely
because it was not like Chicago.

"It Isn't as lively as Chicago," said Hurstwood.  "Don't you like it?"

"No," said Carrie, whose feelings were already localized in the great
Western city.

"Well, it isn't as interesting," said Hurstwood.

"What's here?" asked Carrie, wondering at his choosing to visit this
town.

"Nothing much," returned Hurstwood.  "It's quite a resort. There's some
pretty scenery about here."

Carrie listened, but with a feeling of unrest.  There was much about
her situation which destroyed the possibility of appreciation.

"We won't stay here long," said Hurstwood, who was now really glad to
note her dissatisfaction.  "You pick out your clothes as soon as
breakfast is over and we'll run down to New York soon. You'll like
that.  It's a lot more like a city than any place outside Chicago."

He was really planning to slip out and away.  He would see what these
detectives would do--what move his employers at Chicago would make--
then he would slip away--down to New York, where it was easy to hide.
He knew enough about that city to know that its mysteries and
possibilities of mystification were infinite.

The more he thought, however, the more wretched his situation became.
He saw that getting here did not exactly clear up the ground.  The firm
would probably employ detectives to watch him-Pinkerton men or agents
of Mooney and Boland.  They might arrest him the moment he tried to
leave Canada.  So he might be compelled to remain here months, and in
what a state!

Back at the hotel Hurstwood was anxious and yet fearful to see the
morning papers.  He wanted to know how far the news of his criminal
deed had spread.  So he told Carrie he would be up in a few moments,
and went to secure and scan the dailies.  No familiar or suspicious
faces were about, and yet he did not like reading in the lobby, so he
sought the main parlor on the floor above and, seated by a window
there, looked them over.  Very little was given to his crime, but it
was there, several "sticks" in all, among all the riffraff of
telegraphed murders, accidents, marriages, and other news.  He wished,
half sadly, that he could undo it all.  Every moment of his time in
this far-off abode of safety but added to his feeling that he had made
a great mistake. There could have been an easier way out if he had only
known.

He left the papers before going to the room, thinking thus to keep them
out of the hands of Carrie.

"Well, how are you feeling?" he asked of her.  She was engaged in
looking out of the window.

"Oh, all right," she answered.

He came over, and was about to begin a conversation with her, when a
knock came at their door.

"Maybe it's one of my parcels," said Carrie.

Hurstwood opened the door, outside of which stood the individual whom
he had so thoroughly suspected.

"You're Mr. Hurstwood, are you?" said the latter, with a volume of
affected shrewdness and assurance.

"Yes," said Hurstwood calmly.  He knew the type so thoroughly that some
of his old familiar indifference to it returned.  Such men as these
were of the lowest stratum welcomed at the resort. He stepped out and
closed the door.

"Well, you know what I am here for, don't you?" said the man
confidentially.

"I can guess," said Hurstwood softly.

"Well, do you intend to try and keep the money?"

"That's my affair," said Hurstwood grimly.

"You can't do it, you know," said the detective, eyeing him coolly.

"Look here, my man," said Hurstwood authoritatively, "you don't
understand anything about this case, and I can't explain to you.
Whatever I intend to do I'll do without advice from the outside. You'll
have to excuse me." "Well, now, there's no use of your talking that
way," said the man, "when you're in the hands of the police.  We can
make a lot of trouble for you if we want to.  You're not registered
right in this house, you haven't got your wife with you, and the
newspapers don't know you're here yet.  You might as well be
reasonable."

"What do you want to know?" asked Hurstwood.

"Whether you're going to send back that money or not."

Hurstwood paused and studied the floor.

"There's no use explaining to you about this," he said at last.
"There's no use of your asking me.  I'm no fool, you know.  I know just
what you can do and what you can't.  You can create a lot of trouble if
you want to.  I know that all right, but it won't help you to get the
money.  Now, I've made up my mind what to do.  I've already written
Fitzgerald and Moy, so there's nothing I can say.  You wait until you
hear more from them."

All the time he had been talking he had been moving away from the door,
down the corridor, out of the hearing of Carrie.  They were now near
the end where the corridor opened into the large general parlor.

"You won't give it up?" said the man.

The words irritated Hurstwood greatly.  Hot blood poured into his
brain.  Many thoughts formulated themselves.  He was no thief. He
didn't want the money.  If he could only explain to Fitzgerald and Moy,
maybe it would be all right again.

"See here," he said, "there's no use my talking about this at all.  I
respect your power all right, but I'll have to deal with the people who
know."

"Well, you can't get out of Canada with it," said the man.

"I don't want to get out," said Hurstwood.  "When I get ready there'll
be nothing to stop me for."

He turned back, and the detective watched him closely.  It seemed an
intolerable thing.  Still he went on and into the room.

"Who was it?" asked Carrie.

"A friend of mine from Chicago."

The whole of this conversation was such a shock that, coming as it did
after all the other worry of the past week, it sufficed to induce a
deep gloom and moral revulsion in Hurstwood.  What hurt him most was
the fact that he was being pursued as a thief.  He began to see the
nature of that social injustice which sees but one side--often but a
single point in a long tragedy.  All the newspapers noted but one
thing, his taking the money.  How and wherefore were but indifferently
dealt with.  All the complications which led up to it were unknown.  He
was accused without being understood.

Sitting in his room with Carrie the same day, he decided to send the
money back.  He would write Fitzgerald and Moy, explain all, and then
send it by express.  Maybe they would forgive him. Perhaps they would
ask him back.  He would make good the false statement he had made about
writing them.  Then he would leave this peculiar town.

For an hour he thought over this plausible statement of the tangle.  He
wanted to tell them about his wife, but couldn't.  He finally narrowed
it down to an assertion that he was light-headed from entertaining
friends, had found the safe open, and having gone so far as to take the
money out, had accidentally closed it. This act he regretted very much.
He was sorry he had put them to so much trouble.  He would undo what he
could by sending the money back--the major portion of it.  The
remainder he would pay up as soon as he could.  Was there any
possibility of his being restored? This he only hinted at.

The troubled state of the man's mind may be judged by the very
construction of this letter.  For the nonce he forgot what a painful
thing it would be to resume his old place, even if it were given him.
He forgot that he had severed himself from the past as by a sword, and
that if he did manage to in some way reunite himself with it, the
jagged line of separation and reunion would always show.  He was always
forgetting something-his wife, Carrie, his need of money, present
situation, or something--and so did not reason clearly.  Nevertheless,
he sent the letter, waiting a reply before sending the money.

Meanwhile, he accepted his present situation with Carrie, getting what
joy out of it he could.

Out came the sun by noon, and poured a golden flood through their open
windows.  Sparrows were twittering.  There were laughter and song in
the air.  Hurstwood could not keep his eyes from Carrie. She seemed the
one ray of sunshine in all his trouble.  Oh, if she would only love him
wholly--only throw her arms around him in the blissful spirit in which
he had seen her in the little park in Chicago--how happy he would be!
It would repay him; it would show him that he had not lost all.  He
would not care.

"Carrie," he said, getting up once and coming over to her, "are you
going to stay with me from now on?"

She looked at him quizzically, but melted with sympathy as the value of
the look upon his face forced itself upon her.  It was love now, keen
and strong--love enhanced by difficulty and worry. She could not help
smiling.

"Let me be everything to you from now on," he said.  "Don't make me
worry any more.  I'll be true to you.  We'll go to New York and get a
nice flat.  I'll go into business again, and we'll be happy.  Won't you
be mine?"

Carrie listened quite solemnly.  There was no great passion in her, but
the drift of things and this man's proximity created a semblance of
affection.  She felt rather sorry for him--a sorrow born of what had
only recently been a great admiration.  True love she had never felt
for him.  She would have known as much if she could have analyzed her
feelings, but this thing which she now felt aroused by his great
feeling broke down the barriers between them.

"You'll stay with me, won't you?" he asked.

"Yes," she said, nodding her head.

He gathered her to himself, imprinting kisses upon her lips and cheeks.

"You must marry me, though," she said. "I'll get a license to-day," he
answered.

"How?" she asked.

"Under a new name," he answered.  "I'll take a new name and live a new
life.  From now on I'm Murdock."

"Oh, don't take that name," said Carrie.

"Why not?" he said.

"I don't like it."

"Well, what shall I take?" he asked.

"Oh, anything, only don't take that."

He thought a while, still keeping his arms about her, and then said:

"How would Wheeler do?"

"That's all right," said Carrie.

"Well, then, Wheeler," he said.  "I'll get the license this afternoon."

They were married by a Baptist minister, the first divine they found
convenient.

At last the Chicago firm answered.  It was by Mr. Moy's dictation.  He
was astonished that Hurstwood had done this; very sorry that it had
come about as it had.  If the money were returned, they would not
trouble to prosecute him, as they really bore him no ill-will.  As for
his returning, or their restoring him to his former position, they had
not quite decided what the effect of it would be.  They would think it
over and correspond with him later, possibly, after a little time, and
so on.

The sum and substance of it was that there was no hope, and they wanted
the money with the least trouble possible.  Hurstwood read his doom.
He decided to pay $9,500 to the agent whom they said they would send,
keeping $1,300 for his own use.  He telegraphed his acquiescence,
explained to the representative who called at the hotel the same day,
took a certificate of payment, and told Carrie to pack her trunk.  He
was slightly depressed over this newest move at the time he began to
make it, but eventually restored himself.  He feared that even yet he
might be seized and taken back, so he tried to conceal his movements,
but it was scarcely possible.  He ordered Carrie's trunk sent to the
depot, where he had it sent by express to New York.  No one seemed to
be observing him, but he left at night.  He was greatly agitated lest
at the first station across the border or at the depot in New York
there should be waiting for him an officer of the law.

Carrie, ignorant of his theft and his fears, enjoyed the entry into the
latter city in the morning.  The round green hills sentineling the
broad, expansive bosom of the Hudson held her attention by their beauty
as the train followed the line of the stream.  She had heard of the
Hudson River, the great city of New York, and now she looked out,
filling her mind with the wonder of it.

As the train turned east at Spuyten Duyvil and followed the east bank
of the Harlem River, Hurstwood nervously called her attention to the
fact that they were on the edge of the city. After her experience with
Chicago, she expected long lines of cars--a great highway of tracks--
and noted the difference.  The sight of a few boats in the Harlem and
more in the East River tickled her young heart.  It was the first sign
of the great sea. Next came a plain street with five-story brick flats,
and then the train plunged into the tunnel.

"Grand Central Station!" called the trainman, as, after a few minutes
of darkness and smoke, daylight reappeared.  Hurstwood arose and
gathered up his small grip.  He was screwed up to the highest tension.
With Carrie he waited at the door and then dismounted.  No one
approached him, but he glanced furtively to and fro as he made for the
street entrance.  So excited was he that he forgot all about Carrie,
who fell behind, wondering at his self-absorption.  As he passed
through the depot proper the strain reached its climax and began to
wane.  All at once he was on the sidewalk, and none but cabmen hailed
him.  He heaved a great breath and turned, remembering Carrie.

"I thought you were going to run off and leave me," she said.

"I was trying to remember which car takes us to the Gilsey," he
answered.

Carrie hardly heard him, so interested was she in the busy scene.

"How large is New York?" she asked.

"Oh a million or more," said Hurstwood.

He looked around and hailed a cab, but he did so in a changed way.

For the first time in years the thought that he must count these little
expenses flashed through his mind.  It was a disagreeable thing.

He decided he would lose no time living in hotels but would rent a
flat.  Accordingly he told Carrie, and she agreed.

"We'll look to-day, if you want to," she said.

Suddenly he thought of his experience in Montreal.  At the more
important hotels he would be certain to meet Chicagoans whom he knew.
He stood up and spoke to the driver.

"Take me to the Belford," he said, knowing it to be less frequented by
those whom he knew.  Then he sat down.

"Where is the residence part?" asked Carrie, who did not take the tall
five-story walls on either hand to be the abodes of families.

"Everywhere," said Hurstwood, who knew the city fairly well. "There are
no lawns in New York.  All these are houses."

"Well, then, I don't like it," said Carrie, who was coming to have a
few opinions of her own.




Chapter XXX
THE KINGDOM OF GREATNESS--THE PILGRIM A DREAM

Whatever a man like Hurstwood could be in Chicago, it is very evident
that he would be but an inconspicuous drop in an ocean like New York.
In Chicago, whose population still ranged about 500,000, millionaires
were not numerous.  The rich had not become so conspicuously rich as to
drown all moderate incomes in obscurity.  The attention of the
inhabitants was not so distracted by local celebrities in the dramatic,
artistic, social, and religious fields as to shut the well-positioned
man from view.  In Chicago the two roads to distinction were politics
and trade.  In New York the roads were any one of a half-hundred, and
each had been diligently pursued by hundreds, so that celebrities were
numerous.  The sea was already full of whales. A common fish must needs
disappear wholly from view--remain unseen.  In other words, Hurstwood
was nothing.

There is a more subtle result of such a situation as this, which,
though not always taken into account, produces the tragedies of the
world.  The great create an atmosphere which reacts badly upon the
small.  This atmosphere is easily and quickly felt. Walk among the
magnificent residences, the splendid equipages, the gilded shops,
restaurants, resorts of all kinds; scent the flowers, the silks, the
wines; drink of the laughter springing from the soul of luxurious
content, of the glances which gleam like light from defiant spears;
feel the quality of the smiles which cut like glistening swords and of
strides born of place, and you shall know of what is the atmosphere of
the high and mighty.  Little use to argue that of such is not the
kingdom of greatness, but so long as the world is attracted by this and
the human heart views this as the one desirable realm which it must
attain, so long, to that heart, will this remain the realm of
greatness.  So long, also, will the atmosphere of this realm work its
desperate results in the soul of man.  It is like a chemical reagent.
One day of it, like one drop of the other, will so affect and discolor
the views, the aims, the desire of the mind, that it will thereafter
remain forever dyed.  A day of it to the untried mind is like opium to
the untried body.  A craving is set up which, if gratified, shall
eternally result in dreams and death.  Aye! dreams unfulfilled--
gnawing, luring, idle phantoms which beckon and lead, beckon and lead,
until death and dissolution dissolve their power and restore us blind
to nature's heart.

A man of Hurstwood's age and temperament is not subject to the
illusions and burning desires of youth, but neither has he the strength
of hope which gushes as a fountain in the heart of youth.  Such an
atmosphere could not incite in him the cravings of a boy of eighteen,
but in so far as they were excited, the lack of hope made them
proportionately bitter.  He could not fail to notice the signs of
affluence and luxury on every hand.  He had been to New York before and
knew the resources of its folly. In part it was an awesome place to
him, for here gathered all that he most respected on this earth--
wealth, place, and fame. The majority of the celebrities with whom he
had tipped glasses in his day as manager hailed from this self-centered
and populous spot.  The most inviting stories of pleasure and luxury
had been told of places and individuals here.  He knew it to be true
that unconsciously he was brushing elbows with fortune the livelong
day; that a hundred or five hundred thousand gave no one the privilege
of living more than comfortably in so wealthy a place. Fashion and pomp
required more ample sums, so that the poor man was nowhere.  All this
he realized, now quite sharply, as he faced the city, cut off from his
friends, despoiled of his modest fortune, and even his name, and forced
to begin the battle for place and comfort all over again.  He was not
old, but he was not so dull but that he could feel he soon would be.
Of a sudden, then, this show of fine clothes, place, and power took on
peculiar significance.  It was emphasized by contrast with his own
distressing state.

And it was distressing.  He soon found that freedom from fear of arrest
was not the sine qua non of his existence.  That danger dissolved, the
next necessity became the grievous thing.  The paltry sum of thirteen
hundred and some odd dollars set against the need of rent, clothing,
food, and pleasure for years to come was a spectacle little calculated
to induce peace of mind in one who had been accustomed to spend five
times that sum in the course of a year.  He thought upon the subject
rather actively the first few days he was in New York, and decided that
he must act quickly.  As a consequence, he consulted the business
opportunities advertised in the morning papers and began investigations
on his own account.

That was not before he had become settled, however.  Carrie and he went
looking for a flat, as arranged, and found one in Seventy-eighth Street
near Amsterdam Avenue.  It was a five-story building, and their flat
was on the third floor.  Owing to the fact that the street was not yet
built up solidly, it was possible to see east to the green tops of the
trees in Central Park and west to the broad waters of the Hudson, a
glimpse of which was to be had out of the west windows.  For the
privilege of six rooms and a bath, running in a straight line, they
were compelled to pay thirty-five dollars a month--an average, and yet
exorbitant, rent for a home at the time.  Carrie noticed the difference
between the size of the rooms here and in Chicago and mentioned it.

"You'll not find anything better, dear," said Hurstwood, "unless you go
into one of the old-fashioned houses, and then you won't have any of
these conveniences."

Carrie picked out the new abode because of its newness and bright wood-
work.  It was one of the very new ones supplied with steam heat, which
was a great advantage.  The stationary range, hot and cold water, dumb-
waiter, speaking tubes, and call-bell for the janitor pleased her very
much.  She had enough of the instincts of a housewife to take great
satisfaction in these things.

Hurstwood made arrangements with one of the installment houses whereby
they furnished the flat complete and accepted fifty dollars down and
ten dollars a month.  He then had a little plate, bearing the name G.
W. Wheeler, made, which he placed on his letter-box in the hall.  It
sounded exceedingly odd to Carrie to be called Mrs. Wheeler by the
janitor, but in time she became used to it and looked upon the name as
her own.

These house details settled, Hurstwood visited some of the advertised
opportunities to purchase an interest in some flourishing down-town
bar.  After the palatial resort in Adams Street, he could not stomach
the commonplace saloons which he found advertised.  He lost a number of
days looking up these and finding them disagreeable.  He did, however,
gain considerable knowledge by talking, for he discovered the influence
of Tammany Hall and the value of standing in with the police.  The most
profitable and flourishing places he found to be those which conducted
anything but a legitimate business, such as that controlled by
Fitzgerald and Moy.  Elegant back rooms and private drinking booths on
the second floor were usually adjuncts of very profitable places.  He
saw by portly keepers, whose shirt fronts shone with large diamonds,
and whose clothes were properly cut, that the liquor business here, as
elsewhere, yielded the same golden profit. At last he found an
individual who had a resort in Warren Street, and susceptible of
improvement.  The owner claimed the business to be excellent, and it
certainly looked so.

"We deal with a very good class of people," he told Hurstwood.
"Merchants, salesmen, and professionals.  It's a well-dressed class.
No bums.  We don't allow 'em in the place."

Hurstwood listened to the cash-register ring, and watched the trade for
a while.

"It's profitable enough for two, is it?" he asked.

"You can see for yourself if you're any judge of the liquor trade,"
said the owner.  "This is only one of the two places I have.  The other
is down in Nassau Street.  I can't tend to them both alone.  If I had
some one who knew the business thoroughly I wouldn't mind sharing with
him in this one and letting him manage it."

"I've had experience enough," said Hurstwood blandly, but he felt a
little diffident about referring to Fitzgerald and Moy.

"Well, you can suit yourself, Mr. Wheeler," said the proprietor.

He only offered a third interest in the stock, fixtures, and good-will,
and this in return for a thousand dollars and managerial ability on the
part of the one who should come in. There was no property involved,
because the owner of the saloon merely rented from an estate.

The offer was genuine enough, but it was a question with Hurstwood
whether a third interest in that locality could be made to yield one
hundred and fifty dollars a month, which he figured he must have in
order to meet the ordinary family expenses and be comfortable.  It was
not the time, however, after many failures to find what he wanted, to
hesitate.  It looked as though a third would pay a hundred a month now.
By judicious management and improvement, it might be made to pay more.
Accordingly he agreed to enter into partnership, and made over his
thousand dollars, preparing to enter the next day.

His first inclination was to be elated, and he confided to Carrie that
he thought he had made an excellent arrangement.  Time, however,
introduced food for reflection.  He found his partner to be very
disagreeable.  Frequently he was the worse for liquor, which made him
surly.  This was the last thing which Hurstwood was used to in
business.  Besides, the business varied.  It was nothing like the class
of patronage which he had enjoyed in Chicago.  He found that it would
take a long time to make friends.  These people hurried in and out
without seeking the pleasures of friendship.  It was no gathering or
lounging place. Whole days and weeks passed without one such hearty
greeting as he had been wont to enjoy every day in Chicago.

For another thing, Hurstwood missed the celebrities--those well
dressed, elite individuals who lend grace to the average bars and bring
news from far-off and exclusive circles.  He did not see one such in a
month.  Evenings, when still at his post, he would occasionally read in
the evening papers incidents concerning celebrities whom he knew--whom
he had drunk a glass with many a time.  They would visit a bar like
Fitzgerald and Moy's in Chicago, or the Hoffman House, uptown, but he
knew that he would never see them down here. Again, the business did
not pay as well as he thought.  It increased a little, but he found he
would have to watch his household expenses, which was humiliating.

In the very beginning it was a delight to go home late at night, as he
did, and find Carrie.  He managed to run up and take dinner with her
between six and seven, and to remain home until nine o'clock in the
morning, but the novelty of this waned after a time, and he began to
feel the drag of his duties.

The first month had scarcely passed before Carrie said in a very
natural way: "I think I'll go down this week and buy a dress.'

"What kind?" said Hurstwood.

"Oh, something for street wear."

"All right," he answered, smiling, although he noted mentally that it
would be more agreeable to his finances if she didn't. Nothing was said
about it the next day, but the following morning he asked:

"Have you done anything about your dress?"

"Not yet," said Carrie.

He paused a few moments, as if in thought, and then said:

"Would you mind putting it off a few days?"

"No," replied Carrie, who did not catch the drift of his remarks. She
had never thought of him in connection with money troubles before.
"Why?"

"Well, I'll tell you," said Hurstwood.  "This investment of mine is
taking a lot of money just now.  I expect to get it all back shortly,
but just at present I am running close."

"Oh!" answered Carrie.  "Why, certainly, dear.  Why didn't you tell me
before?"

"It wasn't necessary," said Hurstwood.

For all her acquiescence, there was something about the way Hurstwood
spoke which reminded Carrie of Drouet and his little deal which he was
always about to put through.  It was only the thought of a second, but
it was a beginning.  It was something new in her thinking of Hurstwood.

Other things followed from time to time, little things of the same
sort, which in their cumulative effect were eventually equal to a full
revelation.  Carrie was not dull by any means.  Two persons cannot long
dwell together without coming to an understanding of one another.  The
mental difficulties of an individual reveal themselves whether he
voluntarily confesses them or not.  Trouble gets in the air and
contributes gloom, which speaks for itself.  Hurstwood dressed as
nicely as usual, but they were the same clothes he had in Canada.
Carrie noticed that he did not install a large wardrobe, though his own
was anything but large.  She noticed, also, that he did not suggest
many amusements, said nothing about the food, seemed concerned about
his business.  This was not the easy Hurstwood of Chicago-not the
liberal, opulent Hurstwood she had known.  The change was too obvious
to escape detection.

In time she began to feel that a change had come about, and that she
was not in his confidence.  He was evidently secretive and kept his own
counsel.  She found herself asking him questions about little things.
This is a disagreeable state to a woman. Great love makes it seem
reasonable, sometimes plausible, but never satisfactory.  Where great
love is not, a more definite and less satisfactory conclusion is
reached.

As for Hurstwood, he was making a great fight against the difficulties
of a changed condition.  He was too shrewd not to realize the
tremendous mistake he had made, and appreciate that he had done well in
getting where he was, and yet he could not help contrasting his present
state with his former, hour after hour, and day after day.

Besides, he had the disagreeable fear of meeting old-time friends, ever
since one such encounter which he made shortly after his arrival in the
city.  It was in Broadway that he saw a man approaching him whom he
knew.  There was no time for simulating non-recognition.  The exchange
of glances had been too sharp, the knowledge of each other too
apparent.  So the friend, a buyer for one of the Chicago wholesale
houses, felt, perforce, the necessity of stopping.

"How are you?" he said, extending his hand with an evident mixture of
feeling and a lack of plausible interest.

"Very well," said Hurstwood, equally embarrassed.  "How is it with
you?"

"All right; I'm down here doing a little buying.  Are you located here
now?"

"Yes," said Hurstwood, "I have a place down in Warren Street."

"Is that so?" said the friend.  "Glad to hear it.  I'll come down and
see you."

"Do," said Hurstwood.

"So long," said the other, smiling affably and going on.

"He never asked for my number," thought Hurstwood; "he wouldn't think
of coming." He wiped his forehead, which had grown damp, and hoped
sincerely he would meet no one else.

These things told upon his good-nature, such as it was.  His one hope
was that things would change for the better in a money way.

He had Carrie.  His furniture was being paid for.  He was maintaining
his position.  As for Carrie, the amusements he could give her would
have to do for the present.  He could probably keep up his pretensions
sufficiently long without exposure to make good, and then all would be
well.  He failed therein to take account of the frailties of human
nature--the difficulties of matrimonial life.  Carrie was young.  With
him and with her varying mental states were common.  At any moment the
extremes of feeling might be anti-polarized at the dinner table.  This
often happens in the best regulated families.  Little things brought
out on such occasions need great love to obliterate them afterward.
Where that is not, both parties count two and two and make a problem
after a while.




Chapter XXXI
A PET OF GOOD FORTUNE--BROADWAY FLAUNTS ITS JOYS

 The effect of the city and his own situation on Hurstwood was
paralleled in the case of Carrie, who accepted the things which fortune
provided with the most genial good-nature.  New York, despite her first
expression of disapproval, soon interested her exceedingly.  Its clear
atmosphere, more populous thoroughfares, and peculiar indifference
struck her forcibly.  She had never seen such a little flat as hers,
and yet it soon enlisted her affection.  The new furniture made an
excellent showing, the sideboard which Hurstwood himself arranged
gleamed brightly.  The furniture for each room was appropriate, and in
the so-called parlor, or front room, was installed a piano, because
Carrie said she would like to learn to play.  She kept a servant and
developed rapidly in household tactics and information.  For the first
time in her life she felt settled, and somewhat justified in the eyes
of society as she conceived of it.  Her thoughts were merry and
innocent enough.  For a long while she concerned herself over the
arrangement of New York flats, and wondered at ten families living in
one building and all remaining strange and indifferent to each other.
She also marveled at the whistles of the hundreds of vessels in the
harbor--the long, low cries of the Sound steamers and ferry-boats when
fog was on.  The mere fact that these things spoke from the sea made
them wonderful. She looked much at what she could see of the Hudson
from her west windows and of the great city building up rapidly on
either hand. It was much to ponder over, and sufficed to entertain her
for more than a year without becoming stale.

For another thing, Hurstwood was exceedingly interesting in his
affection for her.  Troubled as he was, he never exposed his
difficulties to her.  He carried himself with the same self-important
air, took his new state with easy familiarity, and rejoiced in Carrie's
proclivities and successes.  Each evening he arrived promptly to
dinner, and found the little dining-room a most inviting spectacle.  In
a way, the smallness of the room added to its luxury.  It looked full
and replete.  The white covered table was arrayed with pretty dishes
and lighted with a four-armed candelabra, each light of which was
topped with a red shade.  Between Carrie and the girl the steaks and
chops came out all right, and canned goods did the rest for a while.
Carrie studied the art of making biscuit, and soon reached the stage
where she could show a plate of light, palatable morsels for her labor.

In this manner the second, third, and fourth months passed. Winter
came, and with it a feeling that indoors was best, so that the
attending of theatres was not much talked of.  Hurstwood made great
efforts to meet all expenditures without a show of feeling one way or
the other.  He pretended that he was reinvesting his money in
strengthening the business for greater ends in the future.  He
contented himself with a very moderate allowance of personal apparel,
and rarely suggested anything for Carrie.  Thus the first winter
passed.

In the second year, the business which Hurstwood managed did increase
somewhat.  He got out of it regularly the $150 per month which he had
anticipated.  Unfortunately, by this time Carrie had reached certain
conclusions, and he had scraped up a few acquaintances.

Being of a passive and receptive rather than an active and aggressive
nature, Carrie accepted the situation.  Her state seemed satisfactory
enough.  Once in a while they would go to a theatre together,
occasionally in season to the beaches and different points about the
city, but they picked up no acquaintances.  Hurstwood naturally
abandoned his show of fine manners with her and modified his attitude
to one of easy familiarity.  There were no misunderstandings, no
apparent differences of opinion.  In fact, without money or visiting
friends, he led a life which could neither arouse jealousy nor comment.
Carrie rather sympathized with his efforts and thought nothing upon her
lack of entertainment such as she had enjoyed in Chicago.  New York as
a corporate entity and her flat temporarily seemed sufficient.

However, as Hurstwood's business increased, he, as stated, began to
pick up acquaintances.  He also began to allow himself more clothes.
He convinced himself that his home life was very precious to him, but
allowed that he could occasionally stay away from dinner.  The first
time he did this he sent a message saying that he would be detained.
Carrie ate alone, and wished that it might not happen again.  The
second time, also, he sent word, but at the last moment.  The third
time he forgot entirely and explained afterwards.  These events were
months apart, each.

"Where were you, George?" asked Carrie, after the first absence.

"Tied up at the office," he said genially.  "There were some accounts I
had to straighten."

"I'm sorry you couldn't get home," she said kindly.  "I was fixing to
have such a nice dinner."

The second time he gave a similar excuse, but the third time the
feeling about it in Carrie's mind was a little bit out of the ordinary.

"I couldn't get home," he said, when he came in later in the evening,
"I was so busy."

"Couldn't you have sent me word?" asked Carrie.

"I meant to," he said, "but you know I forgot it until it was too late
to do any good."

"And I had such a good dinner!" said Carrie.

Now, it so happened that from his observations of Carrie he began to
imagine that she was of the thoroughly domestic type of mind. He really
thought, after a year, that her chief expression in life was finding
its natural channel in household duties. Notwithstanding the fact that
he had observed her act in Chicago, and that during the past year he
had only seen her limited in her relations to her flat and him by
conditions which he made, and that she had not gained any friends or
associates, he drew this peculiar conclusion.  With it came a feeling
of satisfaction in having a wife who could thus be content, and this
satisfaction worked its natural result.  That is, since he imagined he
saw her satisfied, he felt called upon to give only that which
contributed to such satisfaction.  He supplied the furniture, the
decorations, the food, and the necessary clothing.  Thoughts of
entertaining her, leading her out into the shine and show of life, grew
less and less.  He felt attracted to the outer world, but did not think
she would care to go along.  Once he went to the theatre alone.
Another time he joined a couple of his new friends at an evening game
of poker.  Since his money-feathers were beginning to grow again he
felt like sprucing about.  All this, however, in a much less imposing
way than had been his wont in Chicago.  He avoided the gay places where
he would be apt to meet those who had known him. Now, Carrie began to
feel this in various sensory ways.  She was not the kind to be
seriously disturbed by his actions.  Not loving him greatly, she could
not be jealous in a disturbing way. In fact, she was not jealous at
all.  Hurstwood was pleased with her placid manner, when he should have
duly considered it.  When he did not come home it did not seem anything
like a terrible thing to her.  She gave him credit for having the usual
allurements of men--people to talk to, places to stop, friends to
consult with.  She was perfectly willing that he should enjoy himself
in his way, but she did not care to be neglected herself. Her state
still seemed fairly reasonable, however.  All she did observe was that
Hurstwood was somewhat different.

Some time in the second year of their residence in Seventy-eighth
Street the flat across the hall from Carrie became vacant, and into it
moved a very handsome young woman and her husband, with both of whom
Carrie afterwards became acquainted.  This was brought about solely by
the arrangement of the flats, which were united in one place, as it
were, by the dumb-waiter.  This useful elevator, by which fuel,
groceries, and the like were sent up from the basement, and garbage and
waste sent down, was used by both residents of one floor; that is, a
small door opened into it from each flat.

If the occupants of both flats answered to the whistle of the janitor
at the same time, they would stand face to face when they opened the
dumb-waiter doors.  One morning, when Carrie went to remove her paper,
the newcomer, a handsome brunette of perhaps twenty-three years of age,
was there for a like purpose.  She was in a night-robe and dressing-
gown, with her hair very much tousled, but she looked so pretty and
good-natured that Carrie instantly conceived a liking for her.  The
newcomer did no more than smile shamefacedly, but it was sufficient.
Carrie felt that she would like to know her, and a similar feeling
stirred in the mind of the other, who admired Carrie's innocent face.

"That's a real pretty woman who has moved in next door," said Carrie to
Hurstwood at the breakfast table.

"Who are they?" asked Hurstwood.

"I don't know," said Carrie.  "The name on the bell is Vance. Some one
over there plays beautifully.  I guess it must be she."

"Well, you never can tell what sort of people you're living next to in
this town, can you?" said Hurstwood, expressing the customary New York
opinion about neighbors.

"Just think," said Carrie, "I have been in this house with nine other
families for over a year and I don't know a soul.  These people have
been here over a month and I haven't seen any one before this morning."

"It's just as well," said Hurstwood.  'You never know who you're going
to get in with.  Some of these people are pretty bad company."

"I expect so," said Carrie, agreeably.

The conversation turned to other things, and Carrie thought no more
upon the subject until a day or two later, when, going out to market,
she encountered Mrs. Vance coming in.  The latter recognized her and
nodded, for which Carrie returned a smile. This settled the probability
of acquaintanceship.  If there had been no faint recognition on this
occasion, there would have been no future association.

Carrie saw no more of Mrs. Vance for several weeks, but she heard her
play through the thin walls which divided the front rooms of the flats,
and was pleased by the merry selection of pieces and the brilliance of
their rendition.  She could play only moderately herself, and such
variety as Mrs. Vance exercised bordered, for Carrie, upon the verge of
great art.  Everything she had seen and heard thus far--the merest
scraps and shadows-indicated that these people were, in a measure,
refined and in comfortable circumstances.  So Carrie was ready for any
extension of the friendship which might follow.

One day Carrie's bell rang and the servant, who was in the kitchen,
pressed the button which caused the front door of the general entrance
on the ground floor to be electrically unlatched.  When Carrie waited
at her own door on the third floor to see who it might be coming up to
call on her, Mrs. Vance appeared.

"I hope you'll excuse me," she said.  "I went out a while ago and
forgot my outside key, so I thought I'd ring your bell."

This was a common trick of other residents of the building, whenever
they had forgotten their outside keys.  They did not apologize for it,
however.

"Certainly," said Carrie.  "I'm glad you did.  I do the same thing
sometimes."

"Isn't it just delightful weather?" said Mrs. Vance, pausing for a
moment.

Thus, after a few more preliminaries, this visiting acquaintance was
well launched, and in the young Mrs. Vance Carrie found an agreeable
companion.

On several occasions Carrie visited her and was visited.  Both flats
were good to look upon, though that of the Vances tended somewhat more
to the luxurious.

"I want you to come over this evening and meet my husband," said Mrs.
Vance, not long after their intimacy began.  "He wants to meet you.
You play cards, don't you?"

"A little," said Carrie.

"Well, we'll have a game of cards.  If your husband comes home bring
him over."

"He's not coming to dinner to-night," said Carrie.

"Well, when he does come we'll call him in."

Carrie acquiesced, and that evening met the portly Vance, an individual
a few years younger than Hurstwood, and who owed his seemingly
comfortable matrimonial state much more to his money than to his good
looks.  He thought well of Carrie upon the first glance and laid
himself out to be genial, teaching her a new game of cards and talking
to her about New York and its pleasures. Mrs. Vance played some upon
the piano, and at last Hurstwood came.

"I am very glad to meet you," he said to Mrs. Vance when Carrie
introduced him, showing much of the old grace which had captivated
Carrie. "Did you think your wife had run away?" said Mr. Vance,
extending his hand upon introduction.

"I didn't know but what she might have found a better husband," said
Hurstwood.

He now turned his attention to Mrs. Vance, and in a flash Carrie saw
again what she for some time had subconsciously missed in Hurstwood--
the adroitness and flattery of which he was capable. She also saw that
she was not well dressed--not nearly as well dressed--as Mrs. Vance.
These were not vague ideas any longer. Her situation was cleared up for
her.  She felt that her life was becoming stale, and therein she felt
cause for gloom.  The old helpful, urging melancholy was restored.  The
desirous Carrie was whispered to concerning her possibilities.

There were no immediate results to this awakening, for Carrie had
little power of initiative; but, nevertheless, she seemed ever capable
of getting herself into the tide of change where she would be easily
borne along.  Hurstwood noticed nothing.  He had been unconscious of
the marked contrasts which Carrie had observed.

He did not even detect the shade of melancholy which settled in her
eyes.  Worst of all, she now began to feel the loneliness of the flat
and seek the company of Mrs. Vance, who liked her exceedingly.

"Let's go to the matinee this afternoon," said Mrs. Vance, who had
stepped across into Carrie's flat one morning, still arrayed in a soft
pink dressing-gown, which she had donned upon rising. Hurstwood and
Vance had gone their separate ways nearly an hour before.

"All right," said Carrie, noticing the air of the petted and well-
groomed woman in Mrs. Vance's general appearance.  She looked as though
she was dearly loved and her every wish gratified.  "What shall we
see?"

"Oh, I do want to see Nat Goodwin," said Mrs. Vance.  "I do think he is
the jolliest actor.  The papers say this is such a good play."

"What time will we have to start?" asked Carrie.

"Let's go at once and walk down Broadway from Thirty-fourth Street,"
said Mrs. Vance.  "It's such an interesting walk.  He's at the Madison
Square."

"I'll be glad to go," said Carrie.  "How much will we have to pay for
seats?"

"Not more than a dollar," said Mrs. Vance.

The latter departed, and at one o'clock reappeared, stunningly arrayed
in a dark-blue walking dress, with a nobby hat to match. Carrie had
gotten herself up charmingly enough, but this woman pained her by
contrast.  She seemed to have so many dainty little things which Carrie
had not.  There were trinkets of gold, an elegant green leather purse
set with her initials, a fancy handkerchief, exceedingly rich in
design, and the like.  Carrie felt that she needed more and better
clothes to compare with this woman, and that any one looking at the two
would pick Mrs. Vance for her raiment alone.  It was a trying, though
rather unjust thought, for Carrie had now developed an equally pleasing
figure, and had grown in comeliness until she was a thoroughly
attractive type of her color of beauty.  There was some difference in
the clothing of the two, both of quality and age, but this difference
was not especially noticeable.  It served, however, to augment Carrie's
dissatisfaction with her state.

The walk down Broadway, then as now, was one of the remarkable features
of the city.  There gathered, before the matinee and afterwards, not
only all the pretty women who love a showy parade, but the men who love
to gaze upon and admire them.  It was a very imposing procession of
pretty faces and fine clothes. Women appeared in their very best hats,
shoes, and gloves, and walked arm in arm on their way to the fine shops
or theatres strung along from Fourteenth to Thirty-fourth Streets.
Equally the men paraded with the very latest they could afford.  A
tailor might have secured hints on suit measurements, a shoemaker on
proper lasts and colors, a hatter on hats.  It was literally true that
if a lover of fine clothes secured a new suit, it was sure to have its
first airing on Broadway.  So true and well understood was this fact,
that several years later a popular song, detailing this and other facts
concerning the afternoon parade on matinee days, and entitled "What
Right Has He on Broadway?" was published, and had quite a vogue about
the music halls of the city.

In all her stay in the city, Carrie had never heard of this showy
parade; had never even been on Broadway when it was taking place. On
the other hand, it was a familiar thing to Mrs. Vance, who not only
knew of it as an entity, but had often been in it, going purposely to
see and be seen, to create a stir with her beauty and dispel any
tendency to fall short in dressiness by contrasting herself with the
beauty and fashion of the town.

Carrie stepped along easily enough after they got out of the car at
Thirty-fourth Street, but soon fixed her eyes upon the lovely company
which swarmed by and with them as they proceeded.  She noticed suddenly
that Mrs. Vance's manner had rather stiffened under the gaze of
handsome men and elegantly dressed ladies, whose glances were not
modified by any rules of propriety.  To stare seemed the proper and
natural thing.  Carrie found herself stared at and ogled.  Men in
flawless top-coats, high hats, and silver-headed walking sticks elbowed
near and looked too often into conscious eyes.  Ladies rustled by in
dresses of stiff cloth, shedding affected smiles and perfume.  Carrie
noticed among them the sprinkling of goodness and the heavy percentage
of vice.  The rouged and powdered cheeks and lips, the scented hair,
the large, misty, and languorous eye, were common enough.  With a start
she awoke to find that she was in fashion's crowd, on parade in a show
place--and such a show place! Jewelers' windows gleamed along the path
with remarkable frequency.  Florist shops, furriers, haberdashers,
confectioners--all followed in rapid succession.  The street was full
of coaches.  Pompous doormen in immense coats, shiny brass belts and
buttons, waited in front of expensive salesrooms.  Coachmen in tan
boots, white tights, and blue jackets waited obsequiously for the
mistresses of carriages who were shopping inside.  The whole street
bore the flavor of riches and show, and Carrie felt that she was not of
it.  She could not, for the life of her, assume the attitude and
smartness of Mrs. Vance, who, in her beauty, was all assurance.  She
could only imagine that it must be evident to many that she was the
less handsomely dressed of the two.  It cut her to the quick, and she
resolved that she would not come here again until she looked better.
At the same time she longed to feel the delight of parading here as an
equal.  Ah, then she would be happy!




Chapter XXXII
THE FEAST OF BELSHAZZAR--A SEER TO TRANSLATE

 Such feelings as were generated in Carrie by this walk put her in an
exceedingly receptive mood for the pathos which followed in the play.
The actor whom they had gone to see had achieved his popularity by
presenting a mellow type of comedy, in which sufficient sorrow was
introduced to lend contrast and relief to humor. For Carrie, as we well
know, the stage had a great attraction.  She had never forgotten her
one histrionic achievement in Chicago.  It dwelt in her mind and
occupied her consciousness during many long afternoons in which her
rocking chair and her latest novel contributed the only pleasures of
her state.  Never could she witness a play without having her own
ability vividly brought to consciousness.  Some scenes made her long to
be a part of them--to give expression to the feelings which she, in the
place of the character represented, would feel. Almost invariably she
would carry the vivid imaginations away with her and brood over them
the next day alone.  She lived as much in these things as in the
realities which made up her daily life.

It was not often that she came to the play stirred to her heart's core
by actualities.  To-day a low song of longing had been set singing in
her heart by the finery, the merriment, the beauty she had seen.  Oh,
these women who had passed her by, hundreds and hundreds strong, who
were they? Whence came the rich, elegant dresses, the astonishingly
colored buttons, the knick-knacks of silver and gold? Where were these
lovely creatures housed? Amid what elegancies of carved furniture,
decorated walls, elaborate tapestries did they move? Where were their
rich apartments, loaded with all that money could provide? In what
stables champed these sleek, nervous horses and rested the gorgeous
carriages? Where lounged the richly groomed footmen? Oh, the mansions,
the lights, the perfume, the loaded boudoirs and tables! New York must
be filled with such bowers, or the beautiful, insolent, supercilious
creatures could not be.  Some hothouses held them. It ached her to know
that she was not one of them--that, alas, she had dreamed a dream and
it had not come true.  She wondered at her own solitude these two years
past--her indifference to the fact that she had never achieved what she
had expected.

The play was one of those drawing-room concoctions in which charmingly
overdressed ladies and gentlemen suffer the pangs of love and jealousy
amid gilded surroundings.  Such bon-mots are ever enticing to those who
have all their days longed for such material surroundings and have
never had them gratified.  They have the charm of showing suffering
under ideal conditions.  Who would not grieve upon a gilded chair? Who
would not suffer amid perfumed tapestries, cushioned furniture, and
liveried servants? Grief under such circumstances becomes an enticing
thing.  Carrie longed to be of it.  She wanted to take her sufferings,
whatever they were, in such a world, or failing that, at least to
simulate them under such charming conditions upon the stage.  So
affected was her mind by what she had seen, that the play now seemed an
extraordinarily beautiful thing.  She was soon lost in the world it
represented, and wished that she might never return.  Between the acts
she studied the galaxy of matinee attendants in front rows and boxes,
and conceived a new idea of the possibilities of New York.  She was
sure she had not seen it all--that the city was one whirl of pleasure
and delight.

Going out, the same Broadway taught her a sharper lesson.  The scene
she had witnessed coming down was now augmented and at its height.
Such a crush of finery and folly she had never seen.  It clinched her
convictions concerning her state.  She had not lived, could not lay
claim to having lived, until something of this had come into her own
life.  Women were spending money like water; she could see that in
every elegant shop she passed. Flowers, candy, jewelry, seemed the
principal things in which the elegant dames were interested.  And she--
she had scarcely enough pin money to indulge in such outings as this a
few times a month.

That night the pretty little flat seemed a commonplace thing.  It was
not what the rest of the world was enjoying.  She saw the servant
working at dinner with an indifferent eye.  In her mind were running
scenes of the play.  Particularly she remembered one beautiful actress-
-the sweetheart who had been wooed and won. The grace of this woman had
won Carrie's heart.  Her dresses had been all that art could suggest,
her sufferings had been so real. The anguish which she had portrayed
Carrie could feel.  It was done as she was sure she could do it.  There
were places in which she could even do better.  Hence she repeated the
lines to herself.  Oh, if she could only have such a part, how broad
would be her life! She, too, could act appealingly.

When Hurstwood came, Carrie was moody.  She was sitting, rocking and
thinking, and did not care to have her enticing imaginations broken in
upon; so she said little or nothing.

"What's the matter, Carrie?" said Hurstwood after a time, noticing her
quiet, almost moody state.

"Nothing," said Carrie.  "I don't feel very well tonight."

"Not sick, are you?" he asked, approaching very close.

"Oh, no," she said, almost pettishly, "I just don't feel very good."

"That's too bad," he said, stepping away and adjusting his vest after
his slight bending over.  "I was thinking we might go to a show to-
night."

"I don't want to go," said Carrie, annoyed that her fine visions should
have thus been broken into and driven out of her mind. "I've been to
the matinee this afternoon."

"Oh, you have?" said Hurstwood.  "What was it?"

"A Gold Mine."

"How was it?"

"Pretty good," said Carrie.

"And you don't want to go again to night?"

"I don't think I do," she said.

Nevertheless, wakened out of her melancholia and called to the dinner
table, she changed her mind.  A little food in the stomach does
wonders.  She went again, and in so doing temporarily recovered her
equanimity.  The great awakening blow had, however, been delivered.  As
often as she might recover from these discontented thoughts now, they
would occur again.  Time and repetition--ah, the wonder of it! The
dropping water and the solid stone--how utterly it yields at last!

Not long after this matinee experience--perhaps a month--Mrs. Vance
invited Carrie to an evening at the theatre with them.  She heard
Carrie say that Hurstwood was not coming home to dinner.

"Why don't you come with us? Don't get dinner for yourself. We're going
down to Sherry's for dinner and then over to the Lyceum.  Come along
with us."

"I think I will," answered Carrie.

She began to dress at three o'clock for her departure at half past five
for the noted dining-room which was then crowding Delmonico's for
position in society.  In this dressing Carrie showed the influence of
her association with the dashing Mrs. Vance.  She had constantly had
her attention called by the latter to novelties in everything which
pertains to a woman's apparel.

"Are you going to get such and such a hat?" or, "Have you seen the new
gloves with the oval pearl buttons?" were but sample phrases out of a
large selection.

"The next time you get a pair of shoes, dearie," said Mrs. Vance, "get
button, with thick soles and patent-leather tips.  They're all the rage
this fall."

"I will," said Carrie.

"Oh, dear, have you seen the new shirtwaists at Altman's? They have
some of the loveliest patterns.  I saw one there that I know would look
stunning on you.  I said so when I saw it."

Carrie listened to these things with considerable interest, for they
were suggested with more of friendliness than is usually common between
pretty women.  Mrs. Vance liked Carrie's stable good-nature so well
that she really took pleasure in suggesting to her the latest things.

"Why don't you get yourself one of those nice serge skirts they're
selling at Lord & Taylor's?" she said one day.  "They're the circular
style, and they're going to be worn from now on.  A dark blue one would
look so nice on you."

Carrie listened with eager ears.  These things never came up between
her and Hurstwood.  Nevertheless, she began to suggest one thing and
another, which Hurstwood agreed to without any expression of opinion.
He noticed the new tendency on Carrie's part, and finally, hearing much
of Mrs. Vance and her delightful ways, suspected whence the change
came.  He was not inclined to offer the slightest objection so soon,
but he felt that Carrie's wants were expanding.  This did not appeal to
him exactly, but he cared for her in his own way, and so the thing
stood.  Still, there was something in the details of the transactions
which caused Carrie to feel that her requests were not a delight to
him.  He did not enthuse over the purchases.  This led her to believe
that neglect was creeping in, and so another small wedge was entered.

Nevertheless, one of the results of Mrs. Vance's suggestions was the
fact that on this occasion Carrie was dressed somewhat to her own
satisfaction.  She had on her best, but there was comfort in the
thought that if she must confine herself to a best, it was neat and
fitting.  She looked the well-groomed woman of twenty-one, and Mrs.
Vance praised her, which brought color to her plump cheeks and a
noticeable brightness into her large eyes.  It was threatening rain,
and Mr. Vance, at his wife's request, had called a coach. "Your husband
isn't coming?" suggested Mr. Vance, as he met Carrie in his little
parlor.

"No; he said he wouldn't be home for dinner."

"Better leave a little note for him, telling him where we are. He might
turn up."

"I will," said Carrie, who had not thought of it before.

"Tell him we'll be at Sherry's until eight o'clock.  He knows, though I
guess."

Carrie crossed the hall with rustling skirts, and scrawled the note,
gloves on.  When she returned a newcomer was in the Vance flat.

"Mrs. Wheeler, let me introduce Mr. Ames, a cousin of mine," said Mrs.
Vance.  "He's going along with us, aren't you, Bob?"

"I'm very glad to meet you," said Ames, bowing politely to Carrie.

The latter caught in a glance the dimensions of a very stalwart figure.
She also noticed that he was smooth-shaven, good looking, and young,
but nothing more.

"Mr. Ames is just down in New York for a few days," put in Vance, "and
we're trying to show him around a little."

"Oh, are you?" said Carrie, taking another glance at the newcomer.

"Yes; I am just on here from Indianapolis for a week or so," said young
Ames, seating himself on the edge of a chair to wait while Mrs. Vance
completed the last touches of her toilet.

"I guess you find New York quite a thing to see, don't you?" said
Carrie, venturing something to avoid a possible deadly silence.

"It is rather large to get around in a week," answered Ames,
pleasantly.

He was an exceedingly genial soul, this young man, and wholly free of
affectation.  It seemed to Carrie he was as yet only overcoming the
last traces of the bashfulness of youth.  He did not seem apt at
conversation, but he had the merit of being well dressed and wholly
courageous.  Carrie felt as if it were not going to be hard to talk to
him.

"Well, I guess we're ready now.  The coach is outside."

"Come on, people," said Mrs. Vance, coming in smiling.  "Bob, you'll
have to look after Mrs. Wheeler."

"I'll try to," said Bob smiling, and edging closer to Carrie. "You
won't need much watching, will you?" he volunteered, in a sort of
ingratiating and help-me-out kind of way.

"Not very, I hope," said Carrie.

They descended the stairs, Mrs. Vance offering suggestions, and climbed
into the open coach.

"All right," said Vance, slamming the coach door, and the conveyance
rolled away.

"What is it we're going to see?" asked Ames.

"Sothern," said Vance, "in 'Lord Chumley.'"

"Oh, he is so good!" said Mrs. Vance.  "He's just the funniest man."

"I notice the papers praise it," said Ames.

"I haven't any doubt," put in Vance, "but we'll all enjoy it very
much."

Ames had taken a seat beside Carrie, and accordingly he felt it his
bounden duty to pay her some attention.  He was interested to find her
so young a wife, and so pretty, though it was only a respectful
interest.  There was nothing of the dashing lady's man about him.  He
had respect for the married state, and thought only of some pretty
marriageable girls in Indianapolis.

"Are you a born New Yorker?" asked Ames of Carrie.

"Oh, no; I've only been here for two years."

"Oh, well, you've had time to see a great deal of it, anyhow."

"I don't seem to have," answered Carrie.  "It's about as strange to me
as when I first came here."

"You're not from the West, are you?"

"Yes.  I'm from Wisconsin," she answered.

"Well, it does seem as if most people in this town haven't been here so
very long.  I hear of lots of Indiana people in my line who are here."

"What is your line?" asked Carrie.

"I'm connected with an electrical company," said the youth.

Carrie followed up this desultory conversation with occasional
interruptions from the Vances.  Several times it became general and
partially humorous, and in that manner the restaurant was reached.

Carrie had noticed the appearance of gayety and pleasure-seeking in the
streets which they were following.  Coaches were numerous, pedestrians
many, and in Fifty-ninth Street the street cars were crowded.  At
Fifty-ninth Street and Fifth Avenue a blaze of lights from several new
hotels which bordered the Plaza Square gave a suggestion of sumptuous
hotel life.  Fifth Avenue, the home of the wealthy, was noticeably
crowded with carriages, and gentlemen in evening dress.  At Sherry's an
imposing doorman opened the coach door and helped them out.  Young Ames
held Carrie's elbow as he helped her up the steps.  They entered the
lobby already swarming with patrons, and then, after divesting
themselves of their wraps, went into a sumptuous dining-room.

In all Carrie's experience she had never seen anything like this. In
the whole time she had been in New York Hurstwood's modified state had
not permitted his bringing her to such a place.  There was an almost
indescribable atmosphere about it which convinced the newcomer that
this was the proper thing.  Here was the place where the matter of
expense limited the patrons to the moneyed or pleasure-loving class.
Carrie had read of it often in the "Morning" and "Evening World." She
had seen notices of dances, parties, balls, and suppers at Sherry's.
The Misses So-and-so would give a party on Wednesday evening at
Sherry's.  Young Mr. So-and-So would entertain a party of friends at a
private luncheon on the sixteenth, at Sherry's.  The common run of
conventional, perfunctory notices of the doings of society, which she
could scarcely refrain from scanning each day, had given her a distinct
idea of the gorgeousness and luxury of this wonderful temple of
gastronomy.  Now, at last, she was really in it.  She had come up the
imposing steps, guarded by the large and portly doorman.  She had seen
the lobby, guarded by another large and portly gentleman, and been
waited upon by uniformed youths who took care of canes, overcoats, and
the like.  Here was the splendid dining-chamber, all decorated and
aglow, where the wealthy ate.  Ah, how fortunate was Mrs. Vance; young,
beautiful, and well off--at least, sufficiently so to come here in a
coach. What a wonderful thing it was to be rich.

Vance led the way through lanes of shining tables, at which were seated
parties of two, three, four, five, or six.  The air of assurance and
dignity about it all was exceedingly noticeable to the novitiate.
Incandescent lights, the reflection of their glow in polished glasses,
and the shine of gilt upon the walls, combined into one tone of light
which it requires minutes of complacent observation to separate and
take particular note of. The white shirt fronts of the gentlemen, the
bright costumes of the ladies, diamonds, jewels, fine feathers--all
were exceedingly noticeable.

Carrie walked with an air equal to that of Mrs. Vance, and accepted the
seat which the head waiter provided for her.  She was keenly aware of
all the little things that were done--the little genuflections and
attentions of the waiters and head waiter which Americans pay for.  The
air with which the latter pulled out each chair, and the wave of the
hand with which he motioned them to be seated, were worth several
dollars in themselves.

Once seated, there began that exhibition of showy, wasteful, and
unwholesome gastronomy as practiced by wealthy Americans, which is the
wonder and astonishment of true culture and dignity the world over.
The large bill of fare held an array of dishes sufficient to feed an
army, sidelined with prices which made reasonable expenditure a
ridiculous impossibility--an order of soup at fifty cents or a dollar,
with a dozen kinds to choose from; oysters in forty styles and at sixty
cents the half-dozen; entrees, fish, and meats at prices which would
house one over night in an average hotel.  One dollar fifty and two
dollars seemed to be the most common figures upon this most tastefully
printed bill of fare.

Carrie noticed this, and in scanning it the price of spring chicken
carried her back to that other bill of fare and far different occasion
when, for the first time, she sat with Drouet in a good restaurant in
Chicago.  It was only momentary--a sad note as out of an old song--and
then it was gone.  But in that flash was seen the other Carrie--poor,
hungry, drifting at her wits' ends, and all Chicago a cold and closed
world, from which she only wandered because she could not find work.

On the walls were designs in color, square spots of robin's-egg blue,
set in ornate frames of gilt, whose corners were elaborate moldings of
fruit and flowers, with fat cupids hovering in angelic comfort.  On the
ceilings were colored traceries with more gilt, leading to a center
where spread a cluster of lights-incandescent globes mingled with
glittering prisms and stucco tendrils of gilt.  The floor was of a
reddish hue, waxed and polished, and in every direction were mirrors--
tall, brilliant, bevel-edged mirrors--reflecting and re-reflecting
forms, faces, and candelabra a score and a hundred times.

The tables were not so remarkable in themselves, and yet the imprint of
Sherry upon the napery, the name of Tiffany upon the silverware, the
name of Haviland upon the china, and over all the glow of the small,
red-shaded candelabra and the reflected tints of the walls on garments
and faces, made them seem remarkable. Each waiter added an air of
exclusiveness and elegance by the manner in which he bowed, scraped,
touched, and trifled with things.  The exclusively personal attention
which he devoted to each one, standing half bent, ear to one side,
elbows akimbo, saying: "Soup--green turtle, yes.  One portion, yes.
Oysters-certainly--half-dozen--yes.  Asparagus.  Olives--yes."

It would be the same with each one, only Vance essayed to order for
all, inviting counsel and suggestions.  Carrie studied the company with
open eyes.  So this was high life in New York.  It was so that the rich
spent their days and evenings.  Her poor little mind could not rise
above applying each scene to all society.  Every fine lady must be in
the crowd on Broadway in the afternoon, in the theatre at the matinee,
in the coaches and dining-halls at night.  It must be glow and shine
everywhere, with coaches waiting, and footmen attending, and she was
out of it all.  In two long years she had never even been in such a
place as this.

Vance was in his element here, as Hurstwood would have been in former
days.  He ordered freely of soup, oysters, roast meats, and side
dishes, and had several bottles of wine brought, which were set down
beside the table in a wicker basket.

Ames was looking away rather abstractedly at the crowd and showed an
interesting profile to Carrie.  His forehead was high, his nose rather
large and strong, his chin moderately pleasing.  He had a good, wide,
well-shaped mouth, and his dark-brown hair was parted slightly on one
side.  He seemed to have the least touch of boyishness to Carrie, and
yet he was a man full grown.

"Do you know," he said, turning back to Carrie, after his reflection,
"I sometimes think it is a shame for people to spend so much money this
way."

Carrie looked at him a moment with the faintest touch of surprise at
his seriousness.  He seemed to be thinking about something over which
she had never pondered.

"Do you?" she answered, interestedly.

"Yes," he said, "they pay so much more than these things are worth.
They put on so much show."

"I don't know why people shouldn't spend when they have it," said Mrs.
Vance.

"It doesn't do any harm," said Vance, who was still studying the bill
of fare, though he had ordered.

Ames was looking away again, and Carrie was again looking at his
forehead.  To her he seemed to be thinking about strange things. As he
studied the crowd his eye was mild.

"Look at that woman's dress over there," he said, again turning to
Carrie, and nodding in a direction.

"Where?" said Carrie, following his eyes.

"Over there in the corner--way over.  Do you see that brooch?"

"Isn't it large?" said Carrie.

"One of the largest clusters of jewels I have ever seen," said Ames.

"It is, isn't it?" said Carrie.  She felt as if she would like to be
agreeable to this young man, and also there came with it, or perhaps
preceded it, the slightest shade of a feeling that he was better
educated than she was--that his mind was better.  He seemed to look it,
and the saving grace in Carrie was that she could understand that
people could be wiser.  She had seen a number of people in her life who
reminded her of what she had vaguely come to think of as scholars.
This strong young man beside her, with his clear, natural look, seemed
to get a hold of things which she did not quite understand, but
approved of.  It was fine to be so, as a man, she thought.

The conversation changed to a book that was having its vogue at the
time--"Molding a Maiden," by Albert Ross.  Mrs. Vance had read it.
Vance had seen it discussed in some of the papers.

"A man can make quite a strike writing a book," said Vance.  "I notice
this fellow Ross is very much talked about." He was looking at Carrie
as he spoke.

"I hadn't heard of him," said Carrie, honestly.

"Oh, I have," said Mrs. Vance.  "He's written lots of things. This last
story is pretty good."

"He doesn't amount to much," said Ames.

Carrie turned her eyes toward him as to an oracle.

"His stuff is nearly as bad as 'Dora Thorne,'" concluded Ames.

Carrie felt this as a personal reproof.  She read "Dora Thorne," or had
a great deal in the past.  It seemed only fair to her, but she supposed
that people thought it very fine.  Now this clear-eyed, fine-headed
youth, who looked something like a student to her, made fun of it.  It
was poor to him, not worth reading.  She looked down, and for the first
time felt the pain of not understanding.

Yet there was nothing sarcastic or supercilious in the way Ames spoke.
He had very little of that in him.  Carrie felt that it was just kindly
thought of a high order--the right thing to think, and wondered what
else was right, according to him.  He seemed to notice that she
listened and rather sympathized with him, and from now on he talked
mostly to her.

As the waiter bowed and scraped about, felt the dishes to see if they
were hot enough, brought spoons and forks, and did all those little
attentive things calculated to impress the luxury of the situation upon
the diner, Ames also leaned slightly to one side and told her of
Indianapolis in an intelligent way.  He really had a very bright mind,
which was finding its chief development in electrical knowledge.  His
sympathies for other forms of information, however, and for types of
people, were quick and warm.  The red glow on his head gave it a sandy
tinge and put a bright glint in his eye.  Carrie noticed all these
things as he leaned toward her and felt exceedingly young.  This man
was far ahead of her.  He seemed wiser than Hurstwood, saner and
brighter than Drouet.  He seemed innocent and clean, and she thought
that he was exceedingly pleasant.  She noticed, also, that his interest
in her was a far-off one.  She was not in his life, nor any of the
things that touched his life, and yet now, as he spoke of these things,
they appealed to her.

"I shouldn't care to be rich," he told her, as the dinner proceeded and
the supply of food warmed up his sympathies; "not rich enough to spend
my money this way."

"Oh, wouldn't you?" said Carrie, the, to her, new attitude forcing
itself distinctly upon her for the first time.

"No," he said.  "What good would it do? A man doesn't need this sort of
thing to be happy."

Carrie thought of this doubtfully; but, coming from him, it had weight
with her.

"He probably could be happy," she thought to herself, "all alone. He's
so strong."

Mr. and Mrs. Vance kept up a running fire of interruptions, and these
impressive things by Ames came at odd moments.  They were sufficient,
however, for the atmosphere that went with this youth impressed itself
upon Carrie without words.  There was something in him, or the world he
moved in, which appealed to her.  He reminded her of scenes she had
seen on the stage--the sorrows and sacrifices that always went with she
knew not what.  He had taken away some of the bitterness of the
contrast between this life and her life, and all by a certain calm
indifference which concerned only him.

As they went out, he took her arm and helped her into the coach, and
then they were off again, and so to the show.

During the acts Carrie found herself listening to him very attentively.
He mentioned things in the play which she most approved of--things
which swayed her deeply.

"Don't you think it rather fine to be an actor?" she asked once.

"Yes, I do," he said, "to be a good one.  I think the theatre a great
thing."

Just this little approval set Carrie's heart bounding.  Ah, if she
could only be an actress--a good one! This man was wise--he knew--and
he approved of it.  If she were a fine actress, such men as he would
approve of her.  She felt that he was good to speak as he had, although
it did not concern her at all.  She did not know why she felt this way.

At the close of the show it suddenly developed that he was not going
back with them.

"Oh, aren't you?" said Carrie, with an unwarrantable feeling.

"Oh, no," he said; "I'm stopping right around here in Thirty-third
Street."

Carrie could not say anything else, but somehow this development
shocked her.  She had been regretting the wane of a pleasant evening,
but she had thought there was a half-hour more.  Oh, the half-hours,
the minutes of the world; what miseries and griefs are crowded into
them!

She said good-bye with feigned indifference.  What matter could it
make? Still, the coach seemed lorn.

When she went into her own flat she had this to think about.  She did
not know whether she would ever see this man any more.  What difference
could it make--what difference could it make?

Hurstwood had returned, and was already in bed.  His clothes were
scattered loosely about.  Carrie came to the door and saw him, then
retreated.  She did not want to go in yet a while.  She wanted to
think.  It was disagreeable to her.

Back in the dining-room she sat in her chair and rocked.  Her little
hands were folded tightly as she thought.  Through a fog of longing and
conflicting desires she was beginning to see.  Oh, ye legions of hope
and pity--of sorrow and pain! She was rocking, and beginning to see.




Chapter XXXIII
WITHOUT THE WALLED CITY--THE SLOPE OF THE YEARS

 The immediate result of this was nothing.  Results from such things
are usually long in growing.  Morning brings a change of feeling.  The
existent condition invariably pleads for itself. It is only at odd
moments that we get glimpses of the misery of things.  The heart
understands when it is confronted with contrasts.  Take them away and
the ache subsides.

Carrie went on, leading much this same life for six months thereafter
or more.  She did not see Ames any more.  He called once upon the
Vances, but she only heard about it through the young wife.  Then he
went West, and there was a gradual subsidence of whatever personal
attraction had existed.  The mental effect of the thing had not gone,
however, and never would entirely.  She had an ideal to contrast men
by--particularly men close to her.

During all this time--a period rapidly approaching three years-
Hurstwood had been moving along in an even path.  There was no apparent
slope downward, and distinctly none upward, so far as the casual
observer might have seen.  But psychologically there was a change,
which was marked enough to suggest the future very distinctly indeed.
This was in the mere matter of the halt his career had received when he
departed from Chicago.  A man's fortune or material progress is very
much the same as his bodily growth.  Either he is growing stronger,
healthier, wiser, as the youth approaching manhood, or he is growing
weaker, older, less incisive mentally, as the man approaching old age.
There are no other states.  Frequently there is a period between the
cessation of youthful accretion and the setting in, in the case of the
middle-aged man, of the tendency toward decay when the two processes
are almost perfectly balanced and there is little doing in either
direction.  Given time enough, however, the balance becomes a sagging
to the grave side.  Slowly at first, then with a modest momentum, and
at last the graveward process is in the full swing.  So it is
frequently with man's fortune.  If its process of accretion is never
halted, if the balancing stage is never reached, there will be no
toppling.  Rich men are, frequently, in these days, saved from this
dissolution of their fortune by their ability to hire younger brains.
These younger brains look upon the interests of the fortune as their
own, and so steady and direct its progress.  If each individual were
left absolutely to the care of his own interests, and were given time
enough in which to grow exceedingly old, his fortune would pass as his
strength and will.  He and his would be utterly dissolved and scattered
unto the four winds of the heavens.

But now see wherein the parallel changes.  A fortune, like a man, is an
organism which draws to itself other minds and other strength than that
inherent in the founder.  Beside the young minds drawn to it by
salaries, it becomes allied with young forces, which make for its
existence even when the strength and wisdom of the founder are fading.
It may be conserved by the growth of a community or of a state.  It may
be involved in providing something for which there is a growing demand.
This removes it at once beyond the special care of the founder.  It
needs not so much foresight now as direction.  The man wanes, the need
continues or grows, and the fortune, fallen into whose hands it may,
continues.  Hence, some men never recognise the turning in the tide of
their abilities.  It is only in chance cases, where a fortune or a
state of success is wrested from them, that the lack of ability to do
as they did formerly becomes apparent. Hurstwood, set down under new
conditions, was in a position to see that he was no longer young.  If
he did not, it was due wholly to the fact that his state was so well
balanced that an absolute change for the worse did not show.

Not trained to reason or introspect himself, he could not analyze the
change that was taking place in his mind, and hence his body, but he
felt the depression of it.  Constant comparison between his old state
and his new showed a balance for the worse, which produced a constant
state of gloom or, at least, depression. Now, it has been shown
experimentally that a constantly subdued frame of mind produces certain
poisons in the blood, called katastates, just as virtuous feelings of
pleasure and delight produce helpful chemicals called anastates.  The
poisons generated by remorse inveigh against the system, and eventually
produce marked physical deterioration.  To these Hurstwood was subject.

In the course of time it told upon his temper.  His eye no longer
possessed that buoyant, searching shrewdness which had characterized it
in Adams Street.  His step was not as sharp and firm.  He was given to
thinking, thinking, thinking.  The new friends he made were not
celebrities.  They were of a cheaper, a slightly more sensual and
cruder, grade.  He could not possibly take the pleasure in this company
that he had in that of those fine frequenters of the Chicago resort.
He was left to brood.

Slowly, exceedingly slowly, his desire to greet, conciliate, and make
at home these people who visited the Warren Street place passed from
him.  More and more slowly the significance of the realm he had left
began to be clear.  It did not seem so wonderful to be in it when he
was in it.  It had seemed very easy for any one to get up there and
have ample raiment and money to spend, but now that he was out of it,
how far off it became.  He began to see as one sees a city with a wall
about it.  Men were posted at the gates.  You could not get in.  Those
inside did not care to come out to see who you were.  They were so
merry inside there that all those outside were forgotten, and he was on
the outside.

Each day he could read in the evening papers of the doings within this
walled city.  In the notices of passengers for Europe he read the names
of eminent frequenters of his old resort.  In the theatrical column
appeared, from time to time, announcements of the latest successes of
men he had known.  He knew that they were at their old gayeties.
Pullmans were hauling them to and fro about the land, papers were
greeting them with interesting mentions, the elegant lobbies of hotels
and the glow of polished dining-rooms were keeping them close within
the walled city.  Men whom he had known, men whom he had tipped glasses
with--rich men, and he was forgotten! Who was Mr. Wheeler? What was the
Warren Street resort? Bah!

If one thinks that such thoughts do not come to so common a type of
mind--that such feelings require a higher mental development-I would
urge for their consideration the fact that it is the higher mental
development that does away with such thoughts.  It is the higher mental
development which induces philosophy and that fortitude which refuses
to dwell upon such things--refuses to be made to suffer by their
consideration.  The common type of mind is exceedingly keen on all
matters which relate to its physical welfare--exceedingly keen.  It is
the unintellectual miser who sweats blood at the loss of a hundred
dollars.  It is the Epictetus who smiles when the last vestige of
physical welfare is removed.

The time came, in the third year, when this thinking began to produce
results in the Warren Street place.  The tide of patronage dropped a
little below what it had been at its best since he had been there.
This irritated and worried him.

There came a night when he confessed to Carrie that the business was
not doing as well this month as it had the month before. This was in
lieu of certain suggestions she had made concerning little things she
wanted to buy.  She had not failed to notice that he did not seem to
consult her about buying clothes for himself.  For the first time, it
struck her as a ruse, or that he said it so that she would not think of
asking for things.  Her reply was mild enough, but her thoughts were
rebellious.  He was not looking after her at all.  She was depending
for her enjoyment upon the Vances.

And now the latter announced that they were going away.  It was
approaching spring, and they were going North.

"Oh, yes," said Mrs. Vance to Carrie, "we think we might as well give
up the flat and store our things.  We'll be gone for the summer, and it
would be a useless expense.  I think we'll settle a little farther down
town when we come back."

Carrie heard this with genuine sorrow.  She had enjoyed Mrs. Vance's
companionship so much.  There was no one else in the house whom she
knew.  Again she would be all alone.

Hurstwood's gloom over the slight decrease in profits and the departure
of the Vances came together.  So Carrie had loneliness and this mood of
her husband to enjoy at the same time.  It was a grievous thing.  She
became restless and dissatisfied, not exactly, as she thought, with
Hurstwood, but with life.  What was it? A very dull round indeed.  What
did she have? Nothing but this narrow, little flat.  The Vances could
travel, they could do the things worth doing, and here she was.  For
what was she made, anyhow? More thought followed, and then tears--tears
seemed justified, and the only relief in the world.

For another period this state continued, the twain leading a rather
monotonous life, and then there was a slight change for the worse.  One
evening, Hurstwood, after thinking about a way to modify Carrie's
desire for clothes and the general strain upon his ability to provide,
said:

"I don't think I'll ever be able to do much with Shaughnessy."

"What's the matter?" said Carrie.

"Oh, he's a slow, greedy 'mick'! He won't agree to anything to improve
the place, and it won't ever pay without it."

"Can't you make him?" said Carrie.

"No; I've tried.  The only thing I can see, if I want to improve, is to
get hold of a place of my own."

"Why don't you?" said Carrie.

"Well, all I have is tied up in there just now.  If I had a chance to
save a while I think I could open a place that would give us plenty of
money."

"Can't we save?" said Carrie.

"We might try it," he suggested.  "I've been thinking that if we'd take
a smaller flat down town and live economically for a year, I would have
enough, with what I have invested, to open a good place.  Then we could
arrange to live as you want to."

"It would suit me all right," said Carrie, who, nevertheless, felt
badly to think it had come to this.  Talk of a smaller flat sounded
like poverty.

"There are lots of nice little flats down around Sixth Avenue, below
Fourteenth Street.  We might get one down there."

"I'll look at them if you say so," said Carrie.

"I think I could break away from this fellow inside of a year," said
Hurstwood.  "Nothing will ever come of this arrangement as it's going
on now."

"I'll look around," said Carrie, observing that the proposed change
seemed to be a serious thing with him.

The upshot of this was that the change was eventually effected; not
without great gloom on the part of Carrie.  It really affected her more
seriously than anything that had yet happened. She began to look upon
Hurstwood wholly as a man, and not as a lover or husband.  She felt
thoroughly bound to him as a wife, and that her lot was cast with his,
whatever it might be; but she began to see that he was gloomy and
taciturn, not a young, strong, and buoyant man.  He looked a little bit
old to her about the eyes and mouth now, and there were other things
which placed him in his true rank, so far as her estimation was
concerned. She began to feel that she had made a mistake.
Incidentally, she also began to recall the fact that he had practically
forced her to flee with him.

The new flat was located in Thirteenth Street, a half block west of
Sixth Avenue, and contained only four rooms.  The new neighborhood did
not appeal to Carrie as much.  There were no trees here, no west view
of the river.  The street was solidly built up.  There were twelve
families here, respectable enough, but nothing like the Vances.  Richer
people required more space.

Being left alone in this little place, Carrie did without a girl. She
made it charming enough, but could not make it delight her. Hurstwood
was not inwardly pleased to think that they should have to modify their
state, but he argued that he could do nothing. He must put the best
face on it, and let it go at that.

He tried to show Carrie that there was no cause for financial alarm,
but only congratulation over the chance he would have at the end of the
year by taking her rather more frequently to the theatre and by
providing a liberal table.  This was for the time only.  He was getting
in the frame of mind where he wanted principally to be alone and to be
allowed to think.  The disease of brooding was beginning to claim him
as a victim.  Only the newspapers and his own thoughts were worth
while.  The delight of love had again slipped away.  It was a case of
live, now, making the best you can out of a very commonplace station in
life.

The road downward has but few landings and level places.  The very
state of his mind, super induced by his condition, caused the breach to
widen between him and his partner.  At last that individual began to
wish that Hurstwood was out of it.  It so happened, however, that a
real estate deal on the part of the owner of the land arranged things
even more effectually than ill will could have schemed.

"Did you see that?" said Shaughnessy one morning to Hurstwood, pointing
to the real estate column in a copy of the "Herald," which he held.

"No, what is it?" said Hurstwood, looking down the items of news.

"The man who owns this ground has sold it."

"You don't say so?" said Hurstwood.

He looked, and there was the notice.  Mr. August Viele had yesterday
registered the transfer of the lot, 25 x 75 feet, at the corner of
Warren and Hudson Streets, to J. F. Slawson for the sum of $57,000.

"Our lease expires when?" asked Hurstwood, thinking.  "Next February,
isn't it?"

"That's right," said Shaughnessy.

"It doesn't say what the new man's going to do with it," remarked
Hurstwood, looking back to the paper.

"We'll hear, I guess, soon enough," said Shaughnessy.

Sure enough, it did develop.  Mr. Slawson owned the property adjoining,
and was going to put up a modern office building.  The present one was
to be torn down.  It would take probably a year and a half to complete
the other one.

All these things developed by degrees, and Hurstwood began to ponder
over what would become of the saloon.  One day he spoke about it to his
partner.

"Do you think it would be worth while to open up somewhere else in the
neighborhood?"

"What would be the use?" said Shaughnessy.  "We couldn't get another
corner around here."

"It wouldn't pay anywhere else, do you think?"

"I wouldn't try it," said the other. The approaching change now took on
a most serious aspect to Hurstwood.  Dissolution meant the loss of his
thousand dollars, and he could not save another thousand in the time.
He understood that Shaughnessy was merely tired of the arrangement, and
would probably lease the new corner, when completed, alone. He began to
worry about the necessity of a new connection and to see impending
serious financial straits unless something turned up.  This left him in
no mood to enjoy his flat or Carrie, and consequently the depression
invaded that quarter.

Meanwhile, he took such time as he could to look about, but
opportunities were not numerous.  More, he had not the same impressive
personality which he had when he first came to New York.  Bad thoughts
had put a shade into his eyes which did not impress others favorably.
Neither had he thirteen hundred dollars in hand to talk with.  About a
month later, finding that he had not made any progress, Shaughnessy
reported definitely that Slawson would not extend the lease.

"I guess this thing's got to come to an end," he said, affecting an air
of concern.

"Well, if it has, it has," answered Hurstwood, grimly.  He would not
give the other a key to his opinions, whatever they were.  He should
not have the satisfaction.

A day or two later he saw that he must say something to Carrie.

"You know," he said, "I think I'm going to get the worst of my deal
down there."

"How is that?" asked Carrie in astonishment.

"Well, the man who owns the ground has sold it.  and the new owner
won't release it to us.  The business may come to an end."

"Can't you start somewhere else?"

"There doesn't seem to be any place.  Shaughnessy doesn't want to."

"Do you lose what you put in?"

"Yes," said Hurstwood, whose face was a study.

"Oh, isn't that too bad?" said Carrie.

"It's a trick," said Hurstwood.  "That's all.  They'll start another
place there all right."

Carrie looked at him, and gathered from his whole demeanor what it
meant.  It was serious, very serious.

"Do you think you can get something else?" she ventured, timidly.

Hurstwood thought a while.  It was all up with the bluff about money
and investment.  She could see now that he was "broke."

"I don't know," he said solemnly; "I can try."




Chapter XXXIV
THE GRIND OF THE MILLSTONES--A SAMPLE OF CHAFF

Carrie pondered over this situation as consistently as Hurstwood, once
she got the facts adjusted in her mind.  It took several days for her
to fully realize that the approach of the dissolution of her husband's
business meant commonplace struggle and privation.  Her mind went back
to her early venture in Chicago, the Hansons and their flat, and her
heart revolted. That was terrible! Everything about poverty was
terrible.  She wished she knew a way out.  Her recent experiences with
the Vances had wholly unfitted her to view her own state with
complacence.  The glamour of the high life of the city had, in the few
experiences afforded her by the former, seized her completely.  She had
been taught how to dress and where to go without having ample means to
do either.  Now, these things-ever-present realities as they were--
filled her eyes and mind. The more circumscribed became her state, the
more entrancing seemed this other.  And now poverty threatened to seize
her entirely and to remove this other world far upward like a heaven to
which any Lazarus might extend, appealingly, his hands.

So, too, the ideal brought into her life by Ames remained.  He had
gone, but here was his word that riches were not everything; that there
was a great deal more in the world than she knew; that the stage was
good, and the literature she read poor.  He was a strong man and clean-
-how much stronger and better than Hurstwood and Drouet she only half
formulated to herself, but the difference was painful.  It was
something to which she voluntarily closed her eyes.

During the last three months of the Warren Street connection, Hurstwood
took parts of days off and hunted, tracking the business
advertisements.  It was a more or less depressing business, wholly
because of the thought that he must soon get something or he would
begin to live on the few hundred dollars he was saving, and then he
would have nothing to invest--he would have to hire out as a clerk.

Everything he discovered in his line advertised as an opportunity, was
either too expensive or too wretched for him. Besides, winter was
coming, the papers were announcing hardships, and there was a general
feeling of hard times in the air, or, at least, he thought so.  In his
worry, other people's worries became apparent.  No item about a firm
failing, a family starving, or a man dying upon the streets, supposedly
of starvation, but arrested his eye as he scanned the morning papers.
Once the "World" came out with a flaring announcement about "80,000
people out of employment in New York this winter," which struck as a
knife at his heart.

"Eighty thousand!" he thought.  "What an awful thing that is."

This was new reasoning for Hurstwood.  In the old days the world had
seemed to be getting along well enough.  He had been wont to see
similar things in the "Daily News," in Chicago, but they did not hold
his attention.  Now, these things were like gray clouds hovering along
the horizon of a clear day.  They threatened to cover and obscure his
life with chilly grayness.  He tried to shake them off, to forget and
brace up.  Sometimes he said to himself, mentally:

"What's the use worrying? I'm not out yet.  I've got six weeks more.
Even if worst comes to worst, I've got enough to live on for six
months."

Curiously, as he troubled over his future, his thoughts occasionally
reverted to his wife and family.  He had avoided such thoughts for the
first three years as much as possible.  He hated her, and he could get
along without her.  Let her go.  He would do well enough.  Now,
however, when he was not doing well enough, he began to wonder what she
was doing, how his children were getting along.  He could see them
living as nicely as ever, occupying the comfortable house and using his
property.

"By George! it's a shame they should have it all," he vaguely thought
to himself on several occasions.  "I didn't do anything."

As he looked back now and analyzed the situation which led up to his
taking the money, he began mildly to justify himself.  What had he
done--what in the world--that should bar him out this way and heap such
difficulties upon him? It seemed only yesterday to him since he was
comfortable and well-to-do.  But now it was all wrested from him.

"She didn't deserve what she got out of me, that is sure.  I didn't do
so much, if everybody could just know."

There was no thought that the facts ought to be advertised.  It was
only a mental justification he was seeking from himself-something that
would enable him to bear his state as a righteous man.

One afternoon, five weeks before the Warren Street place closed up, he
left the saloon to visit three or four places he saw advertised in the
"Herald." One was down in Gold Street, and he visited that, but did not
enter.  It was such a cheap looking place he felt that he could not
abide it.  Another was on the Bowery, which he knew contained many
showy resorts.  It was near Grand Street, and turned out to be very
handsomely fitted up.  He talked around about investments for fully
three-quarters of an hour with the proprietor, who maintained that his
health was poor, and that was the reason he wished a partner.

"Well, now, just how much money would it take to buy a half interest
here?" said Hurstwood, who saw seven hundred dollars as his limit.

"Three thousand," said the man.

Hurstwood's jaw fell.

"Cash?" he said.

"Cash."

He tried to put on an air of deliberation, as one who might really buy;
but his eyes showed gloom.  He wound up by saying he would think it
over, and came away.  The man he had been talking to sensed his
condition in a vague way.

"I don't think he wants to buy," he said to himself.  "He doesn't talk
right."

The afternoon was as gray as lead and cold.  It was blowing up a
disagreeable winter wind.  He visited a place far up on the east side,
near Sixty-ninth Street, and it was five o'clock, and growing dim, when
he reached there.  A portly German kept this place.

"How about this ad of yours?" asked Hurstwood, who rather objected to
the looks of the place.

"Oh, dat iss all over," said the German.  "I vill not sell now."

"Oh, is that so?"

"Yes; dere is nothing to dat.  It iss all over."

"Very well," said Hurstwood, turning around.

The German paid no more attention to him, and it made him angry.

"The crazy ass!" he said to himself.  "What does he want to advertise
for?"

Wholly depressed, he started for Thirteenth Street.  The flat had only
a light in the kitchen, where Carrie was working.  He struck a match
and, lighting the gas, sat down in the dining-room without even
greeting her.  She came to the door and looked in.

"It's you, is it?" she said, and went back.

"Yes," he said, without even looking up from the evening paper he had
bought.

Carrie saw things were wrong with him.  He was not so handsome when
gloomy.  The lines at the sides of the eyes were deepened. Naturally
dark of skin, gloom made him look slightly sinister. He was quite a
disagreeable figure.

Carrie set the table and brought in the meal.

"Dinner's ready," she said, passing him for something.

He did not answer, reading on.

She came in and sat down at her place, feeling exceedingly wretched.

"Won't you eat now?" she asked.

He folded his paper and drew near, silence holding for a time, except
for the "Pass me's."

"It's been gloomy to-day, hasn't it?" ventured Carrie, after a time.

"Yes," he said.

He only picked at his food.

"Are you still sure to close up?" said Carrie, venturing to take up the
subject which they had discussed often enough.

"Of course we are," he said, with the slightest modification of
sharpness.

This retort angered Carrie.  She had had a dreary day of it herself.

"You needn't talk like that," she said.

"Oh!" he exclaimed, pushing back from the table, as if to say more, but
letting it go at that.  Then he picked up his paper. Carrie left her
seat, containing herself with difficulty.  He saw she was hurt.

"Don't go 'way," he said, as she started back into the kitchen. "Eat
your dinner."

She passed, not answering.

He looked at the paper a few moments, and then rose up and put on his
coat.

"I'm going downtown, Carrie," he said, coming out.  "I'm out of sorts
to-night."

She did not answer.

"Don't be angry," he said.  "It will be all right to morrow."

He looked at her, but she paid no attention to him, working at her
dishes.

"Good-bye!" he said finally, and went out.

This was the first strong result of the situation between them, but
with the nearing of the last day of the business the gloom became
almost a permanent thing.  Hurstwood could not conceal his feelings
about the matter.  Carrie could not help wondering where she was
drifting.  It got so that they talked even less than usual, and yet it
was not Hurstwood who felt any objection to Carrie.  It was Carrie who
shied away from him.  This he noticed. It aroused an objection to her
becoming indifferent to him.  He made the possibility of friendly
intercourse almost a giant task, and then noticed with discontent that
Carrie added to it by her manner and made it more impossible.

At last the final day came.  When it actually arrived, Hurstwood, who
had got his mind into such a state where a thunderclap and raging storm
would have seemed highly appropriate, was rather relieved to find that
it was a plain, ordinary day.  The sun shone, the temperature was
pleasant.  He felt, as he came to the breakfast table, that it wasn't
so terrible, after all.

"Well," he said to Carrie, "to-day's my last day on earth."

Carrie smiled in answer to his humor.

Hurstwood glanced over his paper rather gaily.  He seemed to have lost
a load.

"I'll go down for a little while," he said after breakfast, "and then
I'll look around.  To-morrow I'll spend the whole day looking about.  I
think I can get something, now this thing's off my hands."

He went out smiling and visited the place.  Shaughnessy was there.
They had made all arrangements to share according to their interests.
When, however, he had been there several hours, gone out three more,
and returned, his elation had departed.  As much as he had objected to
the place, now that it was no longer to exist, he felt sorry.  He
wished that things were different.

Shaughnessy was coolly businesslike.

"Well," he said at five o'clock, "we might as well count the change and
divide."

They did so.  The fixtures had already been sold and the sum divided.

"Good-night," said Hurstwood at the final moment, in a last effort to
be genial.

"So long," said Shaughnessy, scarcely deigning a notice.

Thus the Warren Street arrangement was permanently concluded.

Carrie had prepared a good dinner at the flat, but after his ride up,
Hurstwood was in a solemn and reflective mood.

"Well?" said Carrie, inquisitively.

"I'm out of that," he answered, taking off his coat.

As she looked at him, she wondered what his financial state was now.
They ate and talked a little.

"Will you have enough to buy in anywhere else?" asked Carrie.

"No," he said.  "I'll have to get something else and save up."

"It would be nice if you could get some place," said Carrie, prompted
by anxiety and hope.

"I guess I will," he said reflectively.

For some days thereafter he put on his overcoat regularly in the
morning and sallied forth.  On these ventures he first consoled himself
with the thought that with the seven hundred dollars he had he could
still make some advantageous arrangement.  He thought about going to
some brewery, which, as he knew, frequently controlled saloons which
they leased, and get them to help him.  Then he remembered that he
would have to pay out several hundred any way for fixtures and that he
would have nothing left for his monthly expenses.  It was costing him
nearly eighty dollars a month to live.

"No," he said, in his sanest moments, "I can't do it.  I'll get
something else and save up."

This getting-something proposition complicated itself the moment he
began to think of what it was he wanted to do.  Manage a place? Where
should he get such a position? The papers contained no requests for
managers.  Such positions, he knew well enough, were either secured by
long years of service or were bought with a half or third interest.
Into a place important enough to need such a manager he had not money
enough to buy.

Nevertheless, he started out.  His clothes were very good and his
appearance still excellent, but it involved the trouble of deluding.
People, looking at him, imagined instantly that a man of his age, stout
and well dressed, must be well off.  He appeared a comfortable owner of
something, a man from whom the common run of mortals could well expect
gratuities.  Being now forty-three years of age, and comfortably built,
walking was not easy.  He had not been used to exercise for many years.
His legs tired, his shoulders ached, and his feet pained him at the
close of the day, even when he took street cars in almost every
direction.  The mere getting up and down, if long continued, produced
this result.

The fact that people took him to be better off than he was, he well
understood.  It was so painfully clear to him that it retarded his
search.  Not that he wished to be less well appearing, but that he was
ashamed to belie his appearance by incongruous appeals.  So he
hesitated, wondering what to do.

He thought of the hotels, but instantly he remembered that he had had
no experience as a clerk, and, what was more important, no
acquaintances or friends in that line to whom he could go.  He did know
some hotel owners in several cities, including New York, but they knew
of his dealings with Fitzgerald and Moy.  He could not apply to them.
He thought of other lines suggested by large buildings or businesses
which he knew of--wholesale groceries, hardware, insurance concerns,
and the like--but he had had no experience.

How to go about getting anything was a bitter thought.  Would he have
to go personally and ask; wait outside an office door, and, then,
distinguished and affluent looking, announce that he was looking for
something to do? He strained painfully at the thought.  No, he could
not do that.

He really strolled about, thinking, and then, the weather being cold,
stepped into a hotel.  He knew hotels well enough to know that any
decent individual was welcome to a chair in the lobby. This was in the
Broadway Central, which was then one of the most important hotels in
the city.  Taking a chair here was a painful thing to him.  To think he
should come to this! He had heard loungers about hotels called chair
warmers.  He had called them that himself in his day.  But here he was,
despite the possibility of meeting some one who knew him, shielding
himself from cold and the weariness of the streets in a hotel lobby.

"I can't do this way," he said to himself.  "There's no use of my
starting out mornings without first thinking up some place to go. I'll
think of some places and then look them up."

It occurred to him that the positions of bartenders were sometimes
open, but he put this out of his mind.  Bartender--he, the ex-manager!

It grew awfully dull sitting in the hotel lobby, and so at four he went
home.  He tried to put on a business air as he went in, but it was a
feeble imitation.  The rocking chair in the dining room was
comfortable.  He sank into it gladly, with several papers he had
bought, and began to read.

As she was going through the room to begin preparing dinner, Carrie
said:

"The man was here for the rent to-day."

"Oh, was he?" said Hurstwood.

The least wrinkle crept into his brow as he remembered that this was
February 2d, the time the man always called.  He fished down in his
pocket for his purse, getting the first taste of paying out when
nothing is coming in.  He looked at the fat, green roll as a sick man
looks at the one possible saving cure.  Then he counted off twenty-
eight dollars.

"Here you are," he said to Carrie, when she came through again.

He buried himself in his papers and read.  Oh, the rest of it-the
relief from walking and thinking! What Lethean waters were these floods
of telegraphed intelligence! He forgot his troubles, in part.  Here was
a young, handsome woman, if you might believe the newspaper drawing,
suing a rich, fat, candy-making husband in Brooklyn for divorce.  Here
was another item detailing the wrecking of a vessel in ice and snow off
Prince's Bay on Staten Island.  A long, bright column told of the
doings in the theatrical world--the plays produced, the actors
appearing, the managers making announcements.  Fannie Davenport was
just opening at the Fifth Avenue.  Daly was producing "King Lear." He
read of the early departure for the season of a party composed of the
Vanderbilts and their friends for Florida.  An interesting shooting
affray was on in the mountains of Kentucky.  So he read, read, read,
rocking in the warm room near the radiator and waiting for dinner to be
served.




Chapter XXXV
THE PASSING OF EFFORT--THE VISAGE OF CARE

 The next morning he looked over the papers and waded through a long
list of advertisements, making a few notes.  Then he turned to the
male-help-wanted column, but with disagreeable feelings. The day was
before him--a long day in which to discover something--and this was how
he must begin to discover.  He scanned the long column, which mostly
concerned bakers, bushelmen, cooks, compositors, drivers, and the like,
finding two things only which arrested his eye.  One was a cashier
wanted in a wholesale furniture house, and the other a salesman for a
whiskey house.  He had never thought of the latter.  At once he decided
to look that up.

The firm in question was Alsbery & Co., whiskey brokers.

He was admitted almost at once to the manager on his appearance.

"Good-morning, sir," said the latter, thinking at first that he was
encountering one of his out-of-town customers.

"Good-morning," said Hurstwood.  "You advertised, I believe, for a
salesman?"

"Oh," said the man, showing plainly the enlightenment which had come to
him.  "Yes.  Yes, I did."

"I thought I'd drop in," said Hurstwood, with dignity.  "I've had some
experience in that line myself."

"Oh, have you?" said the man.  "What experience have you had?"

"Well, I've managed several liquor houses in my time.  Recently I owned
a third-interest in a saloon at Warren and Hudson streets."

"I see," said the man.

Hurstwood ceased, waiting for some suggestion.

"We did want a salesman," said the man.  "I don't know as it's anything
you'd care to take hold of, though."

"I see," said Hurstwood.  "Well, I'm in no position to choose, just at
present.  If it were open, I should be glad to get it."

The man did not take kindly at all to his "No position to choose." He
wanted some one who wasn't thinking of a choice or something better.
Especially not an old man.  He wanted some one young, active, and glad
to work actively for a moderate sum. Hurstwood did not please him at
all.  He had more of an air than his employers.

"Well," he said in answer, "we'd be glad to consider your application.
We shan't decide for a few days yet.  Suppose you send us your
references."

"I will," said Hurstwood.

He nodded good-morning and came away.  At the corner he looked at the
furniture company's address, and saw that it was in West Twenty-third
Street.  Accordingly, he went up there.  The place was not large
enough, however.  It looked moderate, the men in it idle and small
salaried.  He walked by, glancing in, and then decided not to go in
there.

"They want a girl, probably, at ten a week," he said.

At one o'clock he thought of eating, and went to a restaurant in
Madison Square.  There he pondered over places which he might look up.
He was tired.  It was blowing up gray again.  Across the way, through
Madison Square Park, stood the great hotels, looking down upon a busy
scene.  He decided to go over to the lobby of one and sit a while.  It
was warm in there and bright. He had seen no one he knew at the
Broadway Central.  In all likelihood he would encounter no one here.
Finding a seat on one of the red plush divans close to the great
windows which look out on Broadway's busy rout, he sat musing.  His
state did not seem so bad in here.  Sitting still and looking out, he
could take some slight consolation in the few hundred dollars he had in
his purse.  He could forget, in a measure, the weariness of the street
and his tiresome searches.  Still, it was only escape from a severe to
a less severe state.  He was still gloomy and disheartened.  There,
minutes seemed to go very slowly.  An hour was a long, long time in
passing.  It was filled for him with observations and mental comments
concerning the actual guests of the hotel, who passed in and out, and
those more prosperous pedestrians whose good fortune showed in their
clothes and spirits as they passed along Broadway, outside.  It was
nearly the first time since he had arrived in the city that his leisure
afforded him ample opportunity to contemplate this spectacle. Now,
being, perforce, idle himself, he wondered at the activity of others.
How gay were the youths he saw, how pretty the women. Such fine clothes
they all wore.  They were so intent upon getting somewhere.  He saw
coquettish glances cast by magnificent girls.  Ah, the money it
required to train with such--how well he knew! How long it had been
since he had had the opportunity to do so!

The clock outside registered four.  It was a little early, but he
thought he would go back to the flat.

This going back to the flat was coupled with the thought that Carrie
would think he was sitting around too much if he came home early.  He
hoped he wouldn't have to, but the day hung heavily on his hands.  Over
there he was on his own ground.  He could sit in his rocking-chair and
read.  This busy, distracting, suggestive scene was shut out.  He could
read his papers.  Accordingly, he went home.  Carrie was reading, quite
alone.  It was rather dark in the flat, shut in as it was.

"You'll hurt your eyes," he said when he saw her.

After taking off his coat, he felt it incumbent upon him to make some
little report of his day.

"I've been talking with a wholesale liquor company," he said.  "I may
go on the road."

"Wouldn't that be nice!" said Carrie. "It wouldn't be such a bad
thing," he answered.

Always from the man at the corner now he bought two papers--the
"Evening World" and "Evening Sun." So now he merely picked his papers
up, as he came by, without stopping.

He drew up his chair near the radiator and lighted the gas.  Then it
was as the evening before.  His difficulties vanished in the items he
so well loved to read.

The next day was even worse than the one before, because now he could
not think of where to go.  Nothing he saw in the papers he studied--
till ten o'clock--appealed to him.  He felt that he ought to go out,
and yet he sickened at the thought.  Where to, where to?

"You mustn't forget to leave me my money for this week," said Carrie,
quietly.

They had an arrangement by which he placed twelve dollars a week in her
hands, out of which to pay current expenses.  He heaved a little sigh
as she said this, and drew out his purse.  Again he felt the dread of
the thing.  Here he was taking off, taking off, and nothing coming in.

"Lord!" he said, in his own thoughts, "this can't go on."

To Carrie he said nothing whatsoever.  She could feel that her request
disturbed him.  To pay her would soon become a distressing thing.

"Yet, what have I got to do with it?" she thought.  "Oh, why should I
be made to worry?"

Hurstwood went out and made for Broadway.  He wanted to think up some
place.  Before long, though, he reached the Grand Hotel at Thirty-first
Street.  He knew of its comfortable lobby.  He was cold after his
twenty blocks' walk.

"I'll go in their barber shop and get a shave," he thought.

Thus he justified himself in sitting down in here after his tonsorial
treatment.

Again, time hanging heavily on his hands, he went home early, and this
continued for several days, each day the need to hunt paining him, and
each day disgust, depression, shamefacedness driving him into lobby
idleness.

At last three days came in which a storm prevailed, and he did not go
out at all.  The snow began to fall late one afternoon. It was a
regular flurry of large, soft, white flakes.  In the morning it was
still coming down with a high wind, and the papers announced a
blizzard.  From out the front windows one could see a deep, soft
bedding.

"I guess I'll not try to go out to-day," he said to Carrie at
breakfast.  "It's going to be awful bad, so the papers say."

"The man hasn't brought my coal, either," said Carrie, who ordered by
the bushel.

"I'll go over and see about it," said Hurstwood.  This was the first
time he had ever suggested doing an errand, but, somehow, the wish to
sit about the house prompted it as a sort of compensation for the
privilege.

All day and all night it snowed, and the city began to suffer from a
general blockade of traffic.  Great attention was given to the details
of the storm by the newspapers, which played up the distress of the
poor in large type.

Hurstwood sat and read by his radiator in the corner.  He did not try
to think about his need of work.  This storm being so terrific, and
tying up all things, robbed him of the need.  He made himself wholly
comfortable and toasted his feet.

Carrie observed his ease with some misgiving.  For all the fury of the
storm she doubted his comfort.  He took his situation too
philosophically.

Hurstwood, however, read on and on.  He did not pay much attention to
Carrie.  She fulfilled her household duties and said little to disturb
him.

The next day it was still snowing, and the next, bitter cold. Hurstwood
took the alarm of the paper and sat still.  Now he volunteered to do a
few other little things.  One was to go to the butcher, another to the
grocery.  He really thought nothing of these little services in
connection with their true significance.  He felt as if he were not
wholly useless--indeed, in such a stress of weather, quite worth while
about the house.

On the fourth day, however, it cleared, and he read that the storm was
over.  Now, however, he idled, thinking how sloppy the streets would
be.

It was noon before he finally abandoned his papers and got under way.
Owing to the slightly warmer temperature the streets were bad.  He went
across Fourteenth Street on the car and got a transfer south on
Broadway.  One little advertisement he had, relating to a saloon down
in Pearl Street.  When he reached the Broadway Central, however, he
changed his mind.

"What's the use?" he thought, looking out upon the slop and snow. "I
couldn't buy into it.  It's a thousand to one nothing comes of it.  I
guess I'll get off," and off he got.  In the lobby he took a seat and
waited again, wondering what he could do.

While he was idly pondering, satisfied to be inside, a well dressed man
passed up the lobby, stopped, looked sharply, as if not sure of his
memory, and then approached.  Hurstwood recognized Cargill, the owner
of the large stables in Chicago of the same name, whom he had last seen
at Avery Hall, the night Carrie appeared there.  The remembrance of how
this individual brought up his wife to shake hands on that occasion was
also on the instant clear.

Hurstwood was greatly abashed.  His eyes expressed the difficulty he
felt.

"Why, it's Hurstwood!" said Cargill, remembering now, and sorry that he
had not recognized him quickly enough in the beginning to have avoided
this meeting.

"Yes," said Hurstwood.  "How are you?"

"Very well," said Cargill, troubled for something to talk about.
"Stopping here?"

"No," said Hurstwood, "just keeping an appointment." "I knew you had
left Chicago.  I was wondering what had become of you."

"Oh, I'm here now," answered Hurstwood, anxious to get away.

"Doing well, I suppose?"

"Excellent."

"Glad to hear it."

They looked at one another, rather embarrassed.

"Well, I have an engagement with a friend upstairs.  I'll leave you.
So long."

Hurstwood nodded his head.

"Damn it all," he murmured, turning toward the door.  "I knew that
would happen."

He walked several blocks up the street.  His watch only registered
1.30.  He tried to think of some place to go or something to do.  The
day was so bad he wanted only to be inside. Finally his feet began to
feel wet and cold, and he boarded a car.  This took him to Fifty-ninth
Street, which was as good as anywhere else.  Landed here, he turned to
walk back along Seventh Avenue, but the slush was too much.  The misery
of lounging about with nowhere to go became intolerable.  He felt as if
he were catching cold.

Stopping at a corner, he waited for a car south bound.  This was no day
to be out; he would go home.

Carrie was surprised to see him at a quarter of three.

"It's a miserable day out," was all he said.  Then he took off his coat
and changed his shoes.

That night he felt a cold coming on and took quinine.  He was feverish
until morning, and sat about the next day while Carrie waited on him.
He was a helpless creature in sickness, not very handsome in a dull-
colored bath gown and his hair uncombed.  He looked haggard about the
eyes and quite old.  Carrie noticed this, and it did not appeal to her.
She wanted to be good-natured and sympathetic, but something about the
man held her aloof.

Toward evening he looked so badly in the weak light that she suggested
he go to bed.

"You'd better sleep alone," she said, "you'll feel better.  I'll open
your bed for you now."

"All right," he said.

As she did all these things, she was in a most despondent state.

"What a life! What a life!" was her one thought.

Once during the day, when he sat near the radiator, hunched up and
reading, she passed through, and seeing him, wrinkled her brows.  In
the front room, where it was not so warm, she sat by the window and
cried.  This was the life cut out for her, was it? To live cooped up in
a small flat with some one who was out of work, idle, and indifferent
to her.  She was merely a servant to him now, nothing more.

This crying made her eyes red, and when, in preparing his bed, she
lighted the gas, and, having prepared it, called him in, he noticed the
fact.

"What's the matter with you?" he asked, looking into her face. His
voice was hoarse and his unkempt head only added to its gruesome
quality.

"Nothing," said Carrie, weakly.

"You've been crying," he said.

"I haven't, either," she answered.

It was not for love of him, that he knew.

"You needn't cry," he said, getting into bed.  "Things will come out
all right."

In a day or two he was up again, but rough weather holding, he stayed
in.  The Italian news dealer now delivered the morning papers, and
these he read assiduously.  A few times after that he ventured out, but
meeting another of his old-time friends, he began to feel uneasy
sitting about hotel corridors.

Every day he came home early, and at last made no pretence of going
anywhere.  Winter was no time to look for anything.

Naturally, being about the house, he noticed the way Carrie did things.
She was far from perfect in household methods and economy, and her
little deviations on this score first caught his eye.  Not, however,
before her regular demand for her allowance became a grievous thing.
Sitting around as he did, the weeks seemed to pass very quickly.  Every
Tuesday Carrie asked for her money.

"Do you think we live as cheaply as we might?" he asked one Tuesday
morning.

"I do the best I can," said Carrie.

Nothing was added to this at the moment, but the next day he said:

"Do you ever go to the Gansevoort Market over here?"

"I didn't know there was such a market," said Carrie.

"They say you can get things lots cheaper there."

Carrie was very indifferent to the suggestion.  These were things which
she did not like at all.

"How much do you pay for a pound of meat?" he asked one day.

"Oh, there are different prices," said Carrie.  "Sirloin steak is
twenty-two cents."

"That's steep, isn't it?" he answered.

So he asked about other things, until finally, with the passing days,
it seemed to become a mania with him.  He learned the prices and
remembered them. His errand-running capacity also improved.  It began
in a small way, of course.  Carrie, going to get her hat one morning,
was stopped by him.

"Where are you going, Carrie?" he asked.

"Over to the baker's," she answered.

"I'd just as leave go for you," he said.

She acquiesced, and he went.  Each afternoon he would go to the corner
for the papers.

"Is there anything you want?" he would say.

By degrees she began to use him.  Doing this, however, she lost the
weekly payment of twelve dollars.

"You want to pay me to-day," she said one Tuesday, about this time.

"How much?" he asked.

She understood well enough what it meant.

"Well, about five dollars," she answered.  "I owe the coal man."

The same day he said:

"I think this Italian up here on the corner sells coal at twenty-five
cents a bushel.  I'll trade with him."

Carrie heard this with indifference.

"All right," she said.

Then it came to be:

"George, I must have some coal to-day," or, "You must get some meat of
some kind for dinner."

He would find out what she needed and order.

Accompanying this plan came skimpiness.

"I only got a half-pound of steak," he said, coming in one afternoon
with his papers.  "We never seem to eat very much."

These miserable details ate the heart out of Carrie.  They blackened
her days and grieved her soul.  Oh, how this man had changed!  All day
and all day, here he sat, reading his papers. The world seemed to have
no attraction.  Once in a while he would go out, in fine weather, it
might be four or five hours, between eleven and four.  She could do
nothing but view him with gnawing contempt.

It was apathy with Hurstwood, resulting from his inability to see his
way out.  Each month drew from his small store.  Now, he had only five
hundred dollars left, and this he hugged, half feeling as if he could
stave off absolute necessity for an indefinite period.  Sitting around
the house, he decided to wear some old clothes he had.  This came first
with the bad days.  Only once he apologized in the very beginning:

"It's so bad to-day, I'll just wear these around." Eventually these
became the permanent thing.

Also, he had been wont to pay fifteen cents for a shave, and a tip of
ten cents.  In his first distress, he cut down the tip to five, then to
nothing.  Later, he tried a ten-cent barber shop, and, finding that the
shave was satisfactory, patronized regularly.  Later still, he put off
shaving to every other day, then to every third, and so on, until once
a week became the rule.  On Saturday he was a sight to see.

Of course, as his own self-respect vanished, it perished for him in
Carrie.  She could not understand what had gotten into the man.  He had
some money, he had a decent suit remaining, he was not bad looking when
dressed up.  She did not forget her own difficult struggle in Chicago,
but she did not forget either that she had never ceased trying.  He
never tried.  He did not even consult the ads in the papers any more.

Finally, a distinct impression escaped from her.

"What makes you put so much butter on the steak?" he asked her one
evening, standing around in the kitchen.

"To make it good, of course," she answered.

"Butter is awful dear these days," he suggested.

"You wouldn't mind it if you were working," she answered.

He shut up after this, and went in to his paper, but the retort rankled
in his mind.  It was the first cutting remark that had come from her.

That same evening, Carrie, after reading, went off to the front room to
bed.  This was unusual.  When Hurstwood decided to go, he retired, as
usual, without a light.  It was then that he discovered Carrie's
absence.

"That's funny," he said; "maybe she's sitting up."

He gave the matter no more thought, but slept.  In the morning she was
not beside him.  Strange to say, this passed without comment.

Night approaching, and a slightly more conversational feeling
prevailing, Carrie said:

"I think I'll sleep alone to-night.  I have a headache."

"All right," said Hurstwood.

The third night she went to her front bed without apologies.

This was a grim blow to Hurstwood, but he never mentioned it.

"All right," he said to himself, with an irrepressible frown, "let her
sleep alone."




Chapter XXXVI
A GRIM RETROGRESSION--THE PHANTOM OF CHANCE

 The Vances, who had been back in the city ever since Christmas, had
not forgotten Carrie; but they, or rather Mrs. Vance, had never called
on her, for the very simple reason that Carrie had never sent her
address.  True to her nature, she corresponded with Mrs. Vance as long
as she still lived in Seventy-eighth Street, but when she was compelled
to move into Thirteenth, her fear that the latter would take it as an
indication of reduced circumstances caused her to study some way of
avoiding the necessity of giving her address.  Not finding any
convenient method, she sorrowfully resigned the privilege of writing to
her friend entirely.  The latter wondered at this strange silence,
thought Carrie must have left the city, and in the end gave her up as
lost.  So she was thoroughly surprised to encounter her in Fourteenth
Street, where she had gone shopping.  Carrie was there for the same
purpose.

"Why, Mrs. Wheeler," said Mrs. Vance, looking Carrie over in a glance,
"where have you been? Why haven't you been to see me? I've been
wondering all this time what had become of you. Really, I----"

"I'm so glad to see you," said Carrie, pleased and yet nonplussed.  Of
all times, this was the worst to encounter Mrs. Vance.  "Why, I'm
living down town here.  I've been intending to come and see you.  Where
are you living now?"

"In Fifty-eighth Street," said Mrs. Vance, "just off Seventh Avenue--
218.  Why don't you come and see me?"

"I will," said Carrie.  "Really, I've been wanting to come.  I know I
ought to.  It's a shame.  But you know----"

"What's your number?" said Mrs. Vance.

"Thirteenth Street," said Carrie, reluctantly.  "112 West."

"Oh," said Mrs. Vance, "that's right near here, isn't it?"

"Yes," said Carrie.  "You must come down and see me some time."

"Well, you're a fine one," said Mrs. Vance, laughing, the while noting
that Carrie's appearance had modified somewhat.  "The address, too,"
she added to herself.  "They must be hard up."

Still she liked Carrie well enough to take her in tow.

"Come with me in here a minute," she exclaimed, turning into a store.

When Carrie returned home, there was Hurstwood, reading as usual. He
seemed to take his condition with the utmost nonchalance.  His beard
was at least four days old.

"Oh," thought Carrie, "if she were to come here and see him?"

She shook her head in absolute misery.  It looked as if her situation
was becoming unbearable.

Driven to desperation, she asked at dinner:

"Did you ever hear any more from that wholesale house?"

"No," he said.  "They don't want an inexperienced man."

Carrie dropped the subject, feeling unable to say more.

"I met Mrs. Vance this afternoon," she said, after a time.

"Did, eh?" he answered.

"They're back in New York now," Carrie went on.  "She did look so
nice."

"Well, she can afford it as long as he puts up for it," returned
Hurstwood.  "He's got a soft job."

Hurstwood was looking into the paper.  He could not see the look of
infinite weariness and discontent Carrie gave him.

"She said she thought she'd call here some day."

"She's been long getting round to it, hasn't she?" said Hurstwood, with
a kind of sarcasm.

The woman didn't appeal to him from her spending side.

"Oh, I don't know," said Carrie, angered by the man's attitude.
"Perhaps I didn't want her to come."

"She's too gay," said Hurstwood, significantly.  "No one can keep up
with her pace unless they've got a lot of money."

"Mr. Vance doesn't seem to find it very hard."

"He may not now," answered Hurstwood, doggedly, well understanding the
inference; "but his life isn't done yet.  You can't tell what'll
happen.  He may get down like anybody else."

There was something quite knavish in the man's attitude.  His eye
seemed to be cocked with a twinkle upon the fortunate, expecting their
defeat.  His own state seemed a thing apart--not considered.

This thing was the remains of his old-time cocksureness and
independence.  Sitting in his flat, and reading of the doings of other
people, sometimes this independent, undefeated mood came upon him.
Forgetting the weariness of the streets and the degradation of search,
he would sometimes prick up his ears.  It was as if he said:

"I can do something.  I'm not down yet.  There's a lot of things coming
to me if I want to go after them."

It was in this mood that he would occasionally dress up, go for a
shave, and, putting on his gloves, sally forth quite actively. Not with
any definite aim.  It was more a barometric condition. He felt just
right for being outside and doing something.

On such occasions, his money went also.  He knew of several poker rooms
down town.  A few acquaintances he had in downtown resorts and about
the City Hall.  It was a change to see them and exchange a few friendly
commonplaces.

He had once been accustomed to hold a pretty fair hand at poker. Many a
friendly game had netted him a hundred dollars or more at the time when
that sum was merely sauce to the dish of the game-not the all in all.
Now, he thought of playing.

"I might win a couple of hundred.  I'm not out of practice."

It is but fair to say that this thought had occurred to him several
times before he acted upon it. The poker room which he first invaded
was over a saloon in West Street, near one of the ferries.  He had been
there before. Several games were going.  These he watched for a time
and noticed that the pots were quite large for the ante involved.

"Deal me a hand," he said at the beginning of a new shuffle.  He pulled
up a chair and studied his cards.  Those playing made that quiet study
of him which is so unapparent, and yet invariably so searching.

Poor fortune was with him at first.  He received a mixed collection
without progression or pairs.  The pot was opened.

"I pass," he said.

On the strength of this, he was content to lose his ante.  The deals
did fairly by him in the long run, causing him to come away with a few
dollars to the good.

The next afternoon he was back again, seeking amusement and profit.
This time he followed up three of a kind to his doom. There was a
better hand across the table, held by a pugnacious Irish youth, who was
a political hanger-on of the Tammany district in which they were
located.  Hurstwood was surprised at the persistence of this
individual, whose bets came with a sangfroid which, if a bluff, was
excellent art.  Hurstwood began to doubt, but kept, or thought to keep,
at least, the cool demeanor with which, in olden times, he deceived
those psychic students of the gaming table, who seem to read thoughts
and moods, rather than exterior evidences, however subtle.  He could
not down the cowardly thought that this man had something better and
would stay to the end, drawing his last dollar into the pot, should he
choose to go so far.  Still, he hoped to win much--his hand was
excellent.  Why not raise it five more?

"I raise you three," said the youth.

"Make it five," said Hurstwood, pushing out his chips.

"Come again," said the youth, pushing out a small pile of reds.

"Let me have some more chips," said Hurstwood to the keeper in charge,
taking out a bill.

A cynical grin lit up the face of his youthful opponent.  When the
chips were laid out, Hurstwood met the raise.

"Five again," said the youth.

Hurstwood's brow was wet.  He was deep in now--very deep for him. Sixty
dollars of his good money was up.  He was ordinarily no coward, but the
thought of losing so much weakened him.  Finally he gave way.  He would
not trust to this fine hand any longer.

"I call," he said.

"A full house!" said the youth, spreading out his cards.

Hurstwood's hand dropped.

"I thought I had you," he said, weakly.

The youth raked in his chips, and Hurstwood came away, not without
first stopping to count his remaining cash on the stair.

"Three hundred and forty dollars," he said.

With this loss and ordinary expenses, so much had already gone.

Back in the flat, he decided he would play no more.

Remembering Mrs. Vance's promise to call, Carrie made one other mild
protest.  It was concerning Hurstwood's appearance.  This very day,
coming home, he changed his clothes to the old togs he sat around in.

"What makes you always put on those old clothes?" asked Carrie.

"What's the use wearing my good ones around here?" he asked.

"Well, I should think you'd feel better." Then she added: "Some one
might call."

"Who?" he said.

"Well, Mrs. Vance," said Carrie.

"She needn't see me," he answered, sullenly.

This lack of pride and interest made Carrie almost hate him.

"Oh," she thought, "there he sits.  'She needn't see me.' I should
think he would be ashamed of himself."

The real bitterness of this thing was added when Mrs. Vance did call.
It was on one of her shopping rounds.  Making her way up the
commonplace hall, she knocked at Carrie's door.  To her subsequent and
agonizing distress, Carrie was out.  Hurstwood opened the door, half-
thinking that the knock was Carrie's.  For once, he was taken honestly
aback.  The lost voice of youth and pride spoke in him.

"Why," he said, actually stammering, "how do you do?"

"How do you do?" said Mrs. Vance, who could scarcely believe her eyes.
His great confusion she instantly perceived.  He did not know whether
to invite her in or not.

"Is your wife at home?" she inquired.

"No," he said, "Carrie's out; but won't you step in? She'll be back
shortly."

"No-o," said Mrs. Vance, realizing the change of it all.  "I'm really
very much in a hurry.  I thought I'd just run up and look in, but I
couldn't stay.  Just tell your wife she must come and see me."

"I will," said Hurstwood, standing back, and feeling intense relief at
her going.  He was so ashamed that he folded his hands weakly, as he
sat in the chair afterwards, and thought.

Carrie, coming in from another direction, thought she saw Mrs. Vance
going away.  She strained her eyes, but could not make sure.

"Was anybody here just now?" she asked of Hurstwood.

"Yes," he said guiltily; "Mrs. Vance."

"Did she see you?" she asked, expressing her full despair. This cut
Hurstwood like a whip, and made him sullen.

"If she had eyes, she did.  I opened the door."

"Oh," said Carrie, closing one hand tightly out of sheer nervousness.
"What did she have to say?"

"Nothing," he answered.  "She couldn't stay."

"And you looking like that!" said Carrie, throwing aside a long
reserve.

"What of it?" he said, angering.  "I didn't know she was coming, did
I?"

"You knew she might," said Carrie.  "I told you she said she was
coming.  I've asked you a dozen times to wear your other clothes. Oh, I
think this is just terrible."

"Oh, let up," he answered.  "What difference does it make? You couldn't
associate with her, anyway.  They've got too much money.

"Who said I wanted to?" said Carrie, fiercely.

"Well, you act like it, rowing around over my looks.  You'd think I'd
committed----"

Carrie interrupted:

"It's true," she said.  "I couldn't if I wanted to, but whose fault is
it? You're very free to sit and talk about who I could associate with.
Why don't you get out and look for work?"

This was a thunderbolt in camp.

"What's it to you?" he said, rising, almost fiercely.  "I pay the rent,
don't I? I furnish the----"

"Yes, you pay the rent," said Carrie.  "You talk as if there was
nothing else in the world but a flat to sit around in.  You haven't
done a thing for three months except sit around and interfere here.
I'd like to know what you married me for?"

"I didn't marry you," he said, in a snarling tone.

"I'd like to know what you did, then, in Montreal?" she answered.

"Well, I didn't marry you," he answered.  "You can get that out of your
head.  You talk as though you didn't know."

Carrie looked at him a moment, her eyes distending.  She had believed
it was all legal and binding enough.

"What did you lie to me for, then?" she asked, fiercely.  "What did you
force me to run away with you for?"

Her voice became almost a sob.

"Force!" he said, with curled lip.  "A lot of forcing I did."

"Oh!" said Carrie, breaking under the strain, and turning.  "Oh, oh!"
and she hurried into the front room.

Hurstwood was now hot and waked up.  It was a great shaking up for him,
both mental and moral.  He wiped his brow as he looked around, and then
went for his clothes and dressed.  Not a sound came from Carrie; she
ceased sobbing when she heard him dressing. She thought, at first, with
the faintest alarm, of being left without money--not of losing him,
though he might be going away permanently.  She heard him open the top
of the wardrobe and take out his hat.  Then the dining-room door
closed, and she knew he had gone.

After a few moments of silence, she stood up, dry-eyed, and looked out
the window.  Hurstwood was just strolling up the street, from the flat,
toward Sixth Avenue.

The latter made progress along Thirteenth and across Fourteenth Street
to Union Square.

"Look for work!" he said to himself.  "Look for work! She tells me to
get out and look for work."

He tried to shield himself from his own mental accusation, which told
him that she was right.

"What a cursed thing that Mrs. Vance's call was, anyhow," he thought.
"Stood right there, and looked me over.  I know what she was thinking."

He remembered the few times he had seen her in Seventy-eight Street.
She was always a swell-looker, and he had tried to put on the air of
being worthy of such as she, in front of her.  Now, to think she had
caught him looking this way.  He wrinkled his forehead in his distress.

"The devil!" he said a dozen times in an hour.

It was a quarter after four when he left the house.  Carrie was in
tears.  There would be no dinner that night.

"What the deuce," he said, swaggering mentally to hide his own shame
from himself.  "I'm not so bad.  I'm not down yet."

He looked around the square, and seeing the several large hotels,
decided to go to one for dinner.  He would get his papers and make
himself comfortable there.

He ascended into the fine parlor of the Morton House, then one of the
best New York hotels, and, finding a cushioned seat, read. It did not
trouble him much that his decreasing sum of money did not allow of such
extravagance.  Like the morphine fiend, he was becoming addicted to his
ease.  Anything to relieve his mental distress, to satisfy his craving
for comfort.  He must do it.  No thoughts for the morrow--he could not
stand to think of it any more than he could of any other calamity.
Like the certainty of death, he tried to shut the certainty of soon
being without a dollar completely out of his mind, and he came very
near doing it.

Well-dressed guests moving to and fro over the thick carpets carried
him back to the old days.  A young lady, a guest of the house, playing
a piano in an alcove pleased him.  He sat there reading.

His dinner cost him $1.50.  By eight o'clock he was through, and then,
seeing guests leaving and the crowd of pleasure-seekers thickening
outside wondered where he should go.  Not home. Carrie would be up.
No, he would not go back there this evening. He would stay out and
knock around as a man who was independent-not broke--well might.  He
bought a cigar, and went outside on the corner where other individuals
were lounging--brokers, racing people, thespians--his own flesh and
blood.  As he stood there, he thought of the old evenings in Chicago,
and how he used to dispose of them.  Many's the game he had had.  This
took him to poker.

"I didn't do that thing right the other day," he thought, referring to
his loss of sixty dollars.  "I shouldn't have weakened.  I could have
bluffed that fellow down.  I wasn't in form, that's what ailed me."

Then he studied the possibilities of the game as it had been played,
and began to figure how he might have won, in several instances, by
bluffing a little harder.

"I'm old enough to play poker and do something with it.  I'll try my
hand to-night."

Visions of a big stake floated before him.  Supposing he did win a
couple of hundred, wouldn't he be in it? Lots of sports he knew made
their living at this game, and a good living, too.

"They always had as much as I had," he thought.

So off he went to a poker room in the neighborhood, feeling much as he
had in the old days.  In this period of self-forgetfulness, aroused
first by the shock of argument and perfected by a dinner in the hotel,
with cocktails and cigars, he was as nearly like the old Hurstwood as
he would ever be again.  It was not the old Hurstwood--only a man
arguing with a divided conscience and lured by a phantom.

This poker room was much like the other one, only it was a back room in
a better drinking resort.  Hurstwood watched a while, and then, seeing
an interesting game, joined in.  As before, it went easy for a while,
he winning a few times and cheering up, losing a few pots and growing
more interested and determined on that account.  At last the
fascinating game took a strong hold on him. He enjoyed its risks and
ventured, on a trifling hand, to bluff the company and secure a fair
stake.  To his self-satisfaction intense and strong, he did it.

In the height of this feeling he began to think his luck was with him.
No one else had done so well.  Now came another moderate hand, and
again he tried to open the jack-pot on it.  There were others there who
were almost reading his heart, so close was their observation.

"I have three of a kind," said one of the players to himself. "I'll
just stay with that fellow to the finish."

The result was that bidding began.

"I raise you ten."

"Good."

"Ten more."

"Good."

"Ten again."

"Right you are."

It got to where Hurstwood had seventy-five dollars up.  The other man
really became serious.  Perhaps this individual (Hurstwood) really did
have a stiff hand.

"I call," he said.

Hurstwood showed his hand.  He was done.  The bitter fact that he had
lost seventy-five dollars made him desperate.

"Let's have another pot," he said, grimly.

"All right," said the man.

Some of the other players quit, but observant loungers took their
places.  Time passed, and it came to twelve o'clock.  Hurstwood held
on, neither winning nor losing much.  Then he grew weary, and on a last
hand lost twenty more.  He was sick at heart.

At a quarter after one in the morning he came out of the place. The
chill, bare streets seemed a mockery of his state.  He walked slowly
west, little thinking of his row with Carrie.  He ascended the stairs
and went into his room as if there had been no trouble.  It was his
loss that occupied his mind.  Sitting down on the bedside he counted
his money.  There was now but a hundred and ninety dollars and some
change.  He put it up and began to undress.

"I wonder what's getting into me, anyhow?" he said.

In the morning Carrie scarcely spoke and he felt as if he must go out
again.  He had treated her badly, but he could not afford to make up.
Now desperation seized him, and for a day or two, going out thus, he
lived like a gentleman--or what he conceived to be a gentleman--which
took money.  For his escapades he was soon poorer in mind and body, to
say nothing of his purse, which had lost thirty by the process.  Then
he came down to cold, bitter sense again.

"The rent man comes to-day," said Carrie, greeting him thus
indifferently three mornings later.

"He does?"

"Yes; this is the second," answered Carrie.

Hurstwood frowned.  Then in despair he got out his purse.

"It seems an awful lot to pay for rent," he said.

He was nearing his last hundred dollars.




Chapter XXXVII
THE SPIRIT AWAKENS--NEW SEARCH FOR THE GATE

 It would be useless to explain how in due time the last fifty dollars
was in sight.  The seven hundred, by his process of handling, had only
carried them into June.  Before the final hundred mark was reached he
began to indicate that a calamity was approaching.

"I don't know," he said one day, taking a trivial expenditure for meat
as a text, "it seems to take an awful lot for us to live."

"It doesn't seem to me," said Carrie, "that we spend very much."

"My money is nearly gone," he said, "and I hardly know where it's gone
to."

"All that seven hundred dollars?" asked Carrie.

"All but a hundred."

He looked so disconsolate that it scared her.  She began to see that
she herself had been drifting.  She had felt it all the time.

"Well, George," she exclaimed, "why don't you get out and look for
something? You could find something."

"I have looked," he said.  "You can t make people give you a place."

She gazed weakly at him and said: "Well, what do you think you will do?
A hundred dollars won't last long."

"I don't know," he said.  "I can't do any more than look."

Carrie became frightened over this announcement.  She thought
desperately upon the subject.  Frequently she had considered the stage
as a door through which she might enter that gilded state which she had
so much craved.  Now, as in Chicago, it came as a last resource in
distress.  Something must be done if he did not get work soon.  Perhaps
she would have to go out and battle again alone.

She began to wonder how one would go about getting a place.  Her
experience in Chicago proved that she had not tried the right way.
There must be people who would listen to and try you--men who would
give you an opportunity.

They were talking at the breakfast table, a morning or two later, when
she brought up the dramatic subject by saying that she saw that Sarah
Bernhardt was coming to this country.  Hurstwood had seen it, too.

"How do people get on the stage, George?" she finally asked,
innocently.

"I don't know," he said.  "There must be dramatic agents."

Carrie was sipping coffee, and did not look up.

"Regular people who get you a place?"

"Yes, I think so," he answered.

Suddenly the air with which she asked attracted his attention.

"You're not still thinking about being an actress, are you?" he asked.

"No," she answered, "I was just wondering."

Without being clear, there was something in the thought which he
objected to.  He did not believe any more, after three years of
observation, that Carrie would ever do anything great in that line.
She seemed too simple, too yielding.  His idea of the art was that it
involved something more pompous.  If she tried to get on the stage she
would fall into the hands of some cheap manager and become like the
rest of them.  He had a good idea of what he meant by THEM.  Carrie was
pretty.  She would get along all right, but where would he be?

"I'd get that idea out of my head, if I were you.  It's a lot more
difficult than you think."

Carrie felt this to contain, in some way, an aspersion upon her
ability.

"You said I did real well in Chicago," she rejoined.

"You did," he answered, seeing that he was arousing opposition, "but
Chicago isn't New York, by a big jump."

Carrie did not answer this at all.  It hurt her.

"The stage," he went on, "is all right if you can be one of the big
guns, but there's nothing to the rest of it.  It takes a long while to
get up."

"Oh, I don't know," said Carrie, slightly aroused.

In a flash, he thought he foresaw the result of this thing.  Now, when
the worst of his situation was approaching, she would get on the stage
in some cheap way and forsake him.  Strangely, he had not conceived
well of her mental ability.  That was because he did not understand the
nature of emotional greatness.  He had never learned that a person
might be emotionally--instead of intellectually--great.  Avery Hall was
too far away for him to look back and sharply remember.  He had lived
with this woman too long.

"Well, I do," he answered.  "If I were you I wouldn't think of it.
It's not much of a profession for a woman."

"It's better than going hungry," said Carrie.  "If you don't want me to
do that, why don't you get work yourself?"

There was no answer ready for this.  He had got used to the suggestion.

"Oh, let up," he answered.

The result of this was that she secretly resolved to try.  It didn't
matter about him.  She was not going to be dragged into poverty and
something worse to suit him.  She could act.  She could get something
and then work up.  What would he say then? She pictured herself already
appearing in some fine performance on Broadway; of going every evening
to her dressing-room and making up.  Then she would come out at eleven
o'clock and see the carriages ranged about, waiting for the people.  It
did not matter whether she was the star or not.  If she were only once
in, getting a decent salary, wearing the kind of clothes she liked,
having the money to do with, going here and there as she pleased, how
delightful it would all be.  Her mind ran over this picture all the day
long.  Hurstwood's dreary state made its beauty become more and more
vivid.

Curiously this idea soon took hold of Hurstwood.  His vanishing sum
suggested that he would need sustenance.  Why could not Carrie assist
him a little until he could get something?

He came in one day with something of this idea in his mind.

"I met John B. Drake to-day," he said.  "He's going to open a hotel
here in the fall.  He says that he can make a place for me then."

"Who is he?" asked Carrie.

"He's the man that runs the Grand Pacific in Chicago."

"Oh," said Carrie.

"I'd get about fourteen hundred a year out of that."

"That would be good, wouldn't it?" she said, sympathetically.

"If I can only get over this summer," he added, "I think I'll be all
right.  I'm hearing from some of my friends again."

Carrie swallowed this story in all its pristine beauty.  She sincerely
wished he could get through the summer.  He looked so hopeless.

"How much money have you left?"

"Only fifty dollars."

"Oh, mercy," she exclaimed, "what will we do? It's only twenty days
until the rent will be due again."

Hurstwood rested his head on his hands and looked blankly at the floor.

"Maybe you could get something in the stage line?" he blandly
suggested.

"Maybe I could," said Carrie, glad that some one approved of the idea.

"I'll lay my hand to whatever I can get," he said, now that he saw her
brighten up.  "I can get something."

She cleaned up the things one morning after he had gone, dressed as
neatly as her wardrobe permitted, and set out for Broadway. She did not
know that thoroughfare very well.  To her it was a wonderful
conglomeration of everything great and mighty.  The theatres were
there--these agencies must be somewhere about.

She decided to stop in at the Madison Square Theatre and ask how to
find the theatrical agents.  This seemed the sensible way. Accordingly,
when she reached that theatre she applied to the clerk at the box
office.

"Eh?" he said, looking out.  "Dramatic agents? I don't know. You'll
find them in the 'Clipper,' though.  They all advertise in that."

"Is that a paper?" said Carrie.

"Yes," said the clerk, marveling at such ignorance of a common fact.
"You can get it at the news-stands," he added politely, seeing how
pretty the inquirer was.

Carrie proceeded to get the "Clipper," and tried to find the agents by
looking over it as she stood beside the stand.  This could not be done
so easily.  Thirteenth Street was a number of blocks off, but she went
back, carrying the precious paper and regretting the waste of time.

Hurstwood was already there, sitting in his place.

"Where were you?" he asked.

"I've been trying to find some dramatic agents."

He felt a little diffident about asking concerning her success. The
paper she began to scan attracted his attention.

"What have you got there?" he asked.

"The 'Clipper.' The man said I'd find their addresses in here."

"Have you been all the way over to Broadway to find that out? I could
have told you."

"Why didn't you?" she asked, without looking up.

"You never asked me," he returned.

She went hunting aimlessly through the crowded columns.  Her mind was
distracted by this man's indifference.  The difficulty of the situation
she was facing was only added to by all he did.  Self commiseration
brewed in her heart.  Tears trembled along her eyelids but did not
fall.  Hurstwood noticed something.

"Let me look."

To recover herself she went into the front room while he searched.
Presently she returned.  He had a pencil, and was writing upon an
envelope.

"Here're three," he said.

Carrie took it and found that one was Mrs. Bermudez, another Marcus
Jenks, a third Percy Weil.  She paused only a moment, and then moved
toward the door.

"I might as well go right away," she said, without looking back.

Hurstwood saw her depart with some faint stirrings of shame, which were
the expression of a manhood rapidly becoming stultified.  He sat a
while, and then it became too much.  He got up and put on his hat.

"I guess I'll go out," he said to himself, and went, strolling nowhere
in particular, but feeling somehow that he must go.

Carrie's first call was upon Mrs. Bermudez, whose address was quite the
nearest.  It was an old-fashioned residence turned into offices.  Mrs.
Bermudez's offices consisted of what formerly had been a back chamber
and a hall bedroom, marked "Private."

As Carrie entered she noticed several persons lounging about-men, who
said nothing and did nothing.

While she was waiting to be noticed, the door of the hall bedroom
opened and from it issued two very mannish-looking women, very tightly
dressed, and wearing white collars and cuffs.  After them came a portly
lady of about forty-five, light-haired, sharp-eyed, and evidently good-
natured.  At least she was smiling.

"Now, don't forget about that," said one of the mannish women.

"I won't," said the portly woman.  "Let's see," she added, "where are
you the first week in February?" "Pittsburgh," said the woman.

"I'll write you there."

"All right," said the other, and the two passed out.

Instantly the portly lady's face became exceedingly sober and shrewd.
She turned about and fixed on Carrie a very searching eye.

"Well," she said, "young woman, what can I do for you?"

"Are you Mrs. Bermudez?"

"Yes."

"Well," said Carrie, hesitating how to begin, "do you get places for
persons upon the stage?"

"Yes."

"Could you get me one?"

"Have you ever had any experience?"

"A very little," said Carrie.

"Whom did you play with?"

"Oh, with no one," said Carrie.  "It was just a show gotten----"

"Oh, I see," said the woman, interrupting her.  "No, I don't know of
anything now."

Carrie's countenance fell.

"You want to get some New York experience," concluded the affable Mrs.
Bermudez.  "We'll take your name, though."

Carrie stood looking while the lady retired to her office.

"What is your address?" inquired a young lady behind the counter,
taking up the curtailed conversation.

"Mrs. George Wheeler," said Carrie, moving over to where she was
writing.  The woman wrote her address in full and then allowed her to
depart at her leisure.

She encountered a very similar experience in the office of Mr. Jenks,
only he varied it by saying at the close: "If you could play at some
local house, or had a program with your name on it, I might do
something."

In the third place the individual asked:

"What sort of work do you want to do?"

"What do you mean?" said Carrie.

"Well, do you want to get in a comedy or on the vaudeville or in the
chorus?"

"Oh, I'd like to get a part in a play," said Carrie.

"Well," said the man, "it'll cost you something to do that." "How
much?" said Carrie, who, ridiculous as it may seem, had not thought of
this before.

"Well, that's for you to say," he answered shrewdly.

Carrie looked at him curiously.  She hardly knew how to continue the
inquiry.

"Could you get me a part if I paid?"

"If we didn't you'd get your money back."

"Oh," she said.

The agent saw he was dealing with an inexperienced soul, and continued
accordingly.

"You'd want to deposit fifty dollars, anyway.  No agent would trouble
about you for less than that."

Carrie saw a light.

"Thank you," she said.  "I'll think about it."

She started to go, and then bethought herself.

"How soon would I get a place?" she asked.

"Well, that's hard to say," said the man.  "You might get one in a
week, or it might be a month.  You'd get the first thing that we
thought you could do."

"I see," said Carrie, and then, half-smiling to be agreeable, she
walked out.

The agent studied a moment, and then said to himself:

"It's funny how anxious these women are to get on the stage."

Carrie found ample food for reflection in the fifty-dollar proposition.
"Maybe they'd take my money and not give me anything," she thought.
She had some jewelry--a diamond ring and pin and several other pieces.
She could get fifty dollars for those if she went to a pawnbroker.

Hurstwood was home before her.  He had not thought she would be so long
seeking.

"Well?" he said, not venturing to ask what news.

"I didn't find out anything to-day," said Carrie, taking off her
gloves.  "They all want money to get you a place."

"How much?" asked Hurstwood.

"Fifty dollars."

"They don't want anything, do they?"

"Oh, they're like everybody else.  You can't tell whether they'd ever
get you anything after you did pay them."

"Well, I wouldn't put up fifty on that basis," said Hurstwood, as if he
were deciding, money in hand.

"I don't know," said Carrie.  "I think I'll try some of the managers."

Hurstwood heard this, dead to the horror of it.  He rocked a little to
and fro, and chewed at his finger.  It seemed all very natural in such
extreme states.  He would do better later on.

Chapter XXXVIII
IN ELF LAND DISPORTING--THE GRIM WORLD WITHOUT

 When Carrie renewed her search, as she did the next day, going to the
Casino, she found that in the opera chorus, as in other fields,
employment is difficult to secure.  Girls who can stand in a line and
look pretty are as numerous as labourers who can swing a pick.  She
found there was no discrimination between one and the other of
applicants, save as regards a conventional standard of prettiness and
form.  Their own opinion or knowledge of their ability went for
nothing.

"Where shall I find Mr. Gray?" she asked of a sulky doorman at the
stage entrance of the Casino.

"You can't see him now; he's busy."

"Do you know when I can see him?"

"Got an appointment with him?"

"No."

"Well, you'll have to call at his office."

"Oh, dear!" exclaimed Carrie.  "Where is his office?"

He gave her the number.

She knew there was no need of calling there now.  He would not be in.
Nothing remained but to employ the intermediate hours in search.

The dismal story of ventures in other places is quickly told. Mr. Daly
saw no one save by appointment.  Carrie waited an hour in a dingy
office, quite in spite of obstacles, to learn this fact of the placid,
indifferent Mr. Dorney.

"You will have to write and ask him to see you."

So she went away.

At the Empire Theatre she found a hive of peculiarly listless and
indifferent individuals.  Everything ornately upholstered, everything
carefully finished, everything remarkably reserved.

At the Lyceum she entered one of those secluded, under-stairway
closets, berugged and bepaneled, which causes one to feel the greatness
of all positions of authority.  Here was reserve itself done into a
box-office clerk, a doorman, and an assistant, glorying in their fine
positions.

"Ah, be very humble now--very humble indeed.  Tell us what it is you
require.  Tell it quickly, nervously, and without a vestige of self-
respect.  If no trouble to us in any way, we may see what we can do."

This was the atmosphere of the Lyceum--the attitude, for that matter,
of every managerial office in the city.  These little proprietors of
businesses are lords indeed on their own ground.

Carrie came away wearily, somewhat more abashed for her pains.

Hurstwood heard the details of the weary and unavailing search that
evening.

"I didn't get to see any one," said Carrie.  "I just walked, and
walked, and waited around."

Hurstwood only looked at her.

"I suppose you have to have some friends before you can get in," she
added, disconsolately.

Hurstwood saw the difficulty of this thing, and yet it did not seem so
terrible.  Carrie was tired and dispirited, but now she could rest.
Viewing the world from his rocking-chair, its bitterness did not seem
to approach so rapidly.  To-morrow was another day.

To-morrow came, and the next, and the next.

Carrie saw the manager at the Casino once.

"Come around," he said, "the first of next week.  I may make some
changes then."

He was a large and corpulent individual, surfeited with good clothes
and good eating, who judged women as another would horseflesh.  Carrie
was pretty and graceful.  She might be put in even if she did not have
any experience.  One of the proprietors had suggested that the chorus
was a little weak on looks.

The first of next week was some days off yet.  The first of the month
was drawing near.  Carrie began to worry as she had never worried
before.

"Do you really look for anything when you go out?" she asked Hurstwood
one morning as a climax to some painful thoughts of her own.

"Of course I do," he said pettishly, troubling only a little over the
disgrace of the insinuation.

"I'd take anything," she said, "for the present.  It will soon be the
first of the month again."

She looked the picture of despair.

Hurstwood quit reading his paper and changed his clothes.

"He would look for something," he thought.  "He would go and see if
some brewery couldn't get him in somewhere.  Yes, he would take a
position as bartender, if he could get it."

It was the same sort of pilgrimage he had made before.  One or two
slight rebuffs, and the bravado disappeared.

"No use," he thought.  "I might as well go on back home."

Now that his money was so low, he began to observe his clothes and feel
that even his best ones were beginning to look commonplace.  This was a
bitter thought.

Carrie came in after he did.

"I went to see some of the variety managers," she said, aimlessly.
"You have to have an act.  They don't want anybody that hasn't."

"I saw some of the brewery people to-day," said Hurstwood.  "One man
told me he'd try to make a place for me in two or three weeks."

In the face of so much distress on Carrie's part, he had to make some
showing, and it was thus he did so.  It was lassitude's apology to
energy.

Monday Carrie went again to the Casino.

"Did I tell you to come around to day?" said the manager, looking her
over as she stood before him.

"You said the first of the week," said Carrie, greatly abashed.

"Ever had any experience?" he asked again, almost severely.

Carrie owned to ignorance.

He looked her over again as he stirred among some papers.  He was
secretly pleased with this pretty, disturbed-looking young woman. "Come
around to the theatre to-morrow morning."

Carrie's heart bounded to her throat.

"I will," she said with difficulty.  She could see he wanted her, and
turned to go.

"Would he really put her to work? Oh, blessed fortune, could it be?"

Already the hard rumble of the city through the open windows became
pleasant.

A sharp voice answered her mental interrogation, driving away all
immediate fears on that score.

"Be sure you're there promptly," the manager said roughly. "You'll be
dropped if you're not."

Carrie hastened away.  She did not quarrel now with Hurstwood's
idleness.  She had a place--she had a place! This sang in her ears.

In her delight she was almost anxious to tell Hurstwood.  But, as she
walked homeward, and her survey of the facts of the case became larger,
she began to think of the anomaly of her finding work in several weeks
and his lounging in idleness for a number of months.

"Why don't he get something?" she openly said to herself.  "If I can he
surely ought to.  It wasn't very hard for me."

She forgot her youth and her beauty.  The handicap of age she did not,
in her enthusiasm, perceive.

Thus, ever, the voice of success. Still, she could not keep her secret.
She tried to be calm and indifferent, but it was a palpable sham.

"Well?" he said, seeing her relieved face.

"I have a place."

"You have?" he said, breathing a better breath.

"Yes."

"What sort of a place is it?" he asked, feeling in his veins as if now
he might get something good also.

"In the chorus," she answered.

"Is it the Casino show you told me about?"

"Yes," she answered.  "I begin rehearsing to-morrow."

There was more explanation volunteered by Carrie, because she was
happy.  At last Hurstwood said:

"Do you know how much you'll get?"

"No, I didn't want to ask," said Carrie.  "I guess they pay twelve or
fourteen dollars a week."

"About that, I guess," said Hurstwood.

There was a good dinner in the flat that evening, owing to the mere
lifting of the terrible strain.  Hurstwood went out for a shave, and
returned with a fair-sized sirloin steak.

"Now, to-morrow," he thought, "I'll look around myself," and with
renewed hope he lifted his eyes from the ground.

On the morrow Carrie reported promptly and was given a place in the
line.  She saw a large, empty, shadowy play-house, still redolent of
the perfumes and blazonry of the night, and notable for its rich,
oriental appearance.  The wonder of it awed and delighted her.  Blessed
be its wondrous reality.  How hard she would try to be worthy of it.
It was above the common mass, above idleness, above want, above
insignificance.  People came to it in finery and carriages to see.  It
was ever a center of light and mirth.  And here she was of it.  Oh, if
she could only remain, how happy would be her days!

"What is your name?" said the manager, who was conducting the drill.

"Madenda," she replied, instantly mindful of the name Drouet had
selected in Chicago.  "Carrie Madenda."

"Well, now, Miss Madenda," he said, very affably, as Carrie thought,
"you go over there."

Then he called to a young woman who was already of the company:

"Miss Clark, you pair with Miss Madenda."

This young lady stepped forward, so that Carrie saw where to go, and
the rehearsal began.

Carrie soon found that while this drilling had some slight resemblance
to the rehearsals as conducted at Avery Hall, the attitude of the
manager was much more pronounced.  She had marveled at the insistence
and superior airs of Mr. Millice, but the individual conducting here
had the same insistence, coupled with almost brutal roughness.  As the
drilling proceeded, he seemed to wax exceedingly wroth over trifles,
and to increase his lung power in proportion.  It was very evident that
he had a great contempt for any assumption of dignity or innocence on
the part of these young women.

"Clark," he would call--meaning, of course, Miss Clark--"why don't you
catch step there?"

"By fours, right! Right, I said, right! For heaven's sake, get on to
yourself! Right!" and in saying this he would lift the last sounds into
a vehement roar.

"Maitland! Maitland!" he called once.

A nervous, comely-dressed little girl stepped out.  Carrie trembled for
her out of the fullness of her own sympathies and fear.

"Yes, sir," said Miss Maitland.

"Is there anything the matter with your ears?"

"No, sir."

"Do you know what 'column left' means?"

"Yes, sir."

"Well, what are you stumbling around the right for? Want to break up
the line?"

"I was just"

"Never mind what you were just.  Keep your ears open."

Carrie pitied, and trembled for her turn.

Yet another suffered the pain of personal rebuke.

"Hold on a minute," cried the manager, throwing up his hands, as if in
despair.  His demeanor was fierce.

"Elvers," he shouted, "what have you got in your mouth?"

"Nothing," said Miss Elvers, while some smiled and stood nervously by.

"Well, are you talking?"

"No, sir."

"Well, keep your mouth still then.  Now, all together again."

At last Carrie's turn came.  It was because of her extreme anxiety to
do all that was required that brought on the trouble.

She heard some one called.

"Mason," said the voice.  "Miss Mason."

She looked around to see who it could be.  A girl behind shoved her a
little, but she did not understand.

"You, you!" said the manager.  "Can't you hear?"

"Oh," said Carrie, collapsing, and blushing fiercely.

"Isn't your name Mason?" asked the manager.

"No, sir," said Carrie, "it's Madenda."

"Well, what's the matter with your feet? Can't you dance?"

"Yes, sir," said Carrie, who had long since learned this art.

"Why don't you do it then? Don't go shuffling along as if you were
dead.  I've got to have people with life in them."

Carrie's cheek burned with a crimson heat.  Her lips trembled a little.

"Yes, sir," she said.

It was this constant urging, coupled with irascibility and energy, for
three long hours.  Carrie came away worn enough in body, but too
excited in mind to notice it.  She meant to go home and practice her
evolutions as prescribed.  She would not err in any way, if she could
help it.

When she reached the flat Hurstwood was not there.  For a wonder he was
out looking for work, as she supposed.  She took only a mouthful to eat
and then practiced on, sustained by visions of freedom from financial
distress--"The sound of glory ringing in her ears."

When Hurstwood returned he was not so elated as when he went away, and
now she was obliged to drop practice and get dinner. Here was an early
irritation.  She would have her work and this. Was she going to act and
keep house?

"I'll not do it," she said, "after I get started.  He can take his
meals out."

Each day thereafter brought its cares.  She found it was not such a
wonderful thing to be in the chorus, and she also learned that her
salary would be twelve dollars a week.  After a few days she had her
first sight of those high and mighties--the leading ladies and
gentlemen.  She saw that they were privileged and deferred to.  She was
nothing--absolutely nothing at all.

At home was Hurstwood, daily giving her cause for thought.  He seemed
to get nothing to do, and yet he made bold to inquire how she was
getting along.  The regularity with which he did this smacked of some
one who was waiting to live upon her labor.  Now that she had a visible
means of support, this irritated her.  He seemed to be depending upon
her little twelve dollars.

"How are you getting along?" he would blandly inquire.

"Oh, all right," she would reply.

"Find it easy?"

"It will be all right when I get used to it."

His paper would then engross his thoughts.

"I got some lard," he would add, as an afterthought.  "I thought maybe
you might want to make some biscuit."

The calm suggestion of the man astonished her a little, especially in
the light of recent developments.  Her dawning independence gave her
more courage to observe, and she felt as if she wanted to say things.
Still she could not talk to him as she had to Drouet.  There was
something in the man's manner of which she had always stood in awe.  He
seemed to have some invisible strength in reserve.

One day, after her first week's rehearsal, what she expected came
openly to the surface.

"We'll have to be rather saving," he said, laying down some meat he had
purchased.  "You won't get any money for a week or so yet."

"No," said Carrie, who was stirring a pan at the stove.

"I've only got the rent and thirteen dollars more," he added.

"That's it," she said to herself.  "I'm to use my money now."

Instantly she remembered that she had hoped to buy a few things for
herself.  She needed clothes.  Her hat was not nice.

"What will twelve dollars do towards keeping up this flat?" she
thought.  "I can't do it.  Why doesn't he get something to do?"

The important night of the first real performance came.  She did not
suggest to Hurstwood that he come and see.  He did not think of going.
It would only be money wasted.  She had such a small part.

The advertisements were already in the papers; the posters upon the
bill-boards.  The leading lady and many members were cited. Carrie was
nothing.

As in Chicago, she was seized with stage fright as the very first
entrance of the ballet approached, but later she recovered.  The
apparent and painful insignificance of the part took fear away from
her.  She felt that she was so obscure it did not matter. Fortunately,
she did not have to wear tights.  A group of twelve were assigned
pretty golden-hued skirts which came only to a line about an inch above
the knee.  Carrie happened to be one of the twelve.

In standing about the stage, marching, and occasionally lifting up her
voice in the general chorus, she had a chance to observe the audience
and to see the inauguration of a great hit.  There was plenty of
applause, but she could not help noting how poorly some of the women of
alleged ability did.

"I could do better than that," Carrie ventured to herself, in several
instances.  To do her justice, she was right.

After it was over she dressed quickly, and as the manager had scolded
some others and passed her, she imagined she must have proved
satisfactory.  She wanted to get out quickly, because she knew but few,
and the stars were gossiping.  Outside were carriages and some correct
youths in attractive clothing, waiting.  Carrie saw that she was
scanned closely.  The flutter of an eyelash would have brought her a
companion.  That she did not give.

One experienced youth volunteered, anyhow.

"Not going home alone, are you?" he said.

Carrie merely hastened her steps and took the Sixth Avenue car. Her
head was so full of the wonder of it that she had time for nothing
else.

"Did you hear any more from the brewery?" she asked at the end of the
week, hoping by the question to stir him on to action.

"No," he answered, "they're not quite ready yet.  I think something
will come of that, though."

She said nothing more then, objecting to giving up her own money, and
yet feeling that such would have to be the case.  Hurstwood felt the
crisis, and artfully decided to appeal to Carrie.  He had long since
realized how good-natured she was, how much she would stand.  There was
some little shame in him at the thought of doing so, but he justified
himself with the thought that he really would get something.  Rent day
gave him his opportunity.

"Well," he said, as he counted it out, "that's about the last of my
money.  I'll have to get something pretty soon."

Carrie looked at him askance, half-suspicious of an appeal.

"If I could only hold out a little longer I think I could get
something.  Drake is sure to open a hotel here in September."

"Is he?" said Carrie, thinking of the short month that still remained
until that time.

"Would you mind helping me out until then?" he said appealingly. "I
think I'll be all right after that time."

"No," said Carrie, feeling sadly handicapped by fate.

"We can get along if we economies.  I'll pay you back all right."

"Oh, I'll help you," said Carrie, feeling quite hardhearted at thus
forcing him to humbly appeal, and yet her desire for the benefit of her
earnings wrung a faint protest from her.

"Why don't you take anything, George, temporarily?" she said. "What
difference does it make? Maybe, after a while, you'll get something
better."

"I will take anything," he said, relieved, and wincing under reproof.
"I'd just as leave dig on the streets.  Nobody knows me here."

"Oh, you needn't do that," said Carrie, hurt by the pity of it. "But
there must be other things."

"I'll get something!" he said, assuming determination.

Then he went back to his paper.




Chapter XXXIX
OF LIGHTS AND OF SHADOWS--THE PARTING OF WORLDS

 What Hurstwood got as the result of this determination was more self-
assurance that each particular day was not the day.  At the same time,
Carrie passed through thirty days of mental distress.

Her need of clothes--to say nothing of her desire for ornaments-grew
rapidly as the fact developed that for all her work she was not to have
them.  The sympathy she felt for Hurstwood, at the time he asked her to
tide him over, vanished with these newer urgings of decency.  He was
not always renewing his request, but this love of good appearance was.
It insisted, and Carrie wished to satisfy it, wished more and more that
Hurstwood was not in the way.

Hurstwood reasoned, when he neared the last ten dollars, that he had
better keep a little pocket change and not become wholly dependent for
car-fare, shaves, and the like; so when this sum was still in his hand
he announced himself as penniless.

"I'm clear out," he said to Carrie one afternoon.  "I paid for some
coal this morning, and that took all but ten or fifteen cents."

"I've got some money there in my purse."

Hurstwood went to get it, starting for a can of tomatoes.  Carrie
scarcely noticed that this was the beginning of the new order. He took
out fifteen cents and bought the can with it.  Thereafter it was dribs
and drabs of this sort, until one morning Carrie suddenly remembered
that she would not be back until close to dinner time.

"We're all out of flour," she said; "you'd better get some this
afternoon.  We haven't any meat, either.  How would it do if we had
liver and bacon?"

"Suits me," said Hurstwood.

"Better get a half or three-quarters of a pound of that."

"Half'll be enough," volunteered Hurstwood.

She opened her purse and laid down a half dollar.  He pretended not to
notice it.

Hurstwood bought the flour--which all grocers sold in 3 1/2-pound
packages--for thirteen cents and paid fifteen cents for a half pound of
liver and bacon.  He left the packages, together with the balance of
twenty-two cents, upon the kitchen table, where Carrie found it.  It
did not escape her that the change was accurate.  There was something
sad in realizing that, after all, all that he wanted of her was
something to eat.  She felt as if hard thoughts were unjust.  Maybe he
would get something yet.  He had no vices.

That very evening, however, on going into the theatre, one of the
chorus girls passed her all newly arrayed in a pretty mottled tweed
suit, which took Carrie's eye.  The young woman wore a fine bunch of
violets and seemed in high spirits.  She smiled at Carrie good-
naturedly as she passed, showing pretty, even teeth, and Carrie smiled
back.

"She can afford to dress well," thought Carrie, "and so could I, if I
could only keep my money.  I haven't a decent tie of any kind to wear."

She put out her foot and looked at her shoe reflectively. "I'll get a
pair of shoes Saturday, anyhow; I don't care what happens."

One of the sweetest and most sympathetic little chorus girls in the
company made friends with her because in Carrie she found nothing to
frighten her away.  She was a gay little Manon, unwitting of society's
fierce conception of morality, but, nevertheless, good to her neighbor
and charitable.  Little license was allowed the chorus in the matter of
conversation, but, nevertheless, some was indulged in.

"It's warm to-night, isn't it?" said this girl, arrayed in pink
fleshings and an imitation golden helmet.  She also carried a shining
shield.

"Yes; it is," said Carrie, pleased that some one should talk to her.

"I'm almost roasting," said the girl.

Carrie looked into her pretty face, with its large blue eyes, and saw
little beads of moisture.

"There's more marching in this opera than ever I did before," added the
girl.

"Have you been in others?" asked Carrie, surprised at her experience.

"Lots of them," said the girl; "haven't you?"

"This is my first experience."

"Oh, is it? I thought I saw you the time they ran 'The Queen's Mate'
here."

"No," said Carrie, shaking her head; "not me."

This conversation was interrupted by the blare of the orchestra and the
sputtering of the calcium lights in the wings as the line was called to
form for a new entrance.  No further opportunity for conversation
occurred, but the next evening, when they were getting ready for the
stage, this girl appeared anew at her side.

"They say this show is going on the road next month."

"Is it?" said Carrie.

"Yes; do you think you'll go?"

"I don't know; I guess so, if they'll take me."

"Oh, they'll take you.  I wouldn't go.  They won't give you any more,
and it will cost you everything you make to live.  I never leave New
York.  There are too many shows going on here."

"Can you always get in another show?"

"I always have.  There's one going on up at the Broadway this month.
I'm going to try and get in that if this one really goes."

Carrie heard this with aroused intelligence.  Evidently it wasn't so
very difficult to get on.  Maybe she also could get a place if this
show went away. "Do they all pay about the same?" she asked.

"Yes.  Sometimes you get a little more.  This show doesn't pay very
much."

"I get twelve," said Carrie.

"Do you?" said the girl.  "They pay me fifteen, and you do more work
than I do.  I wouldn't stand it if I were you.  They're just giving you
less because they think you don't know.  You ought to be making
fifteen."

"Well, I'm not," said Carrie.

"Well, you'll get more at the next place if you want it," went on the
girl, who admired Carrie very much.  "You do fine, and the manager
knows it."

To say the truth, Carrie did unconsciously move about with an air
pleasing and somewhat distinctive.  It was due wholly to her natural
manner and total lack of self-consciousness.

"Do you suppose I could get more up at the Broadway?"

"Of course you can," answered the girl.  "You come with me when I go.
I'll do the talking."

Carrie heard this, flushing with thankfulness.  She liked this little
gaslight soldier.  She seemed so experienced and self-reliant in her
tinsel helmet and military accoutrements.

"My future must be assured if I can always get work this way," thought
Carrie.

Still, in the morning, when her household duties would infringe upon
her and Hurstwood sat there, a perfect load to contemplate, her fate
seemed dismal and unrelieved.  It did not take so very much to feed
them under Hurstwood's close-measured buying, and there would possibly
be enough for rent, but it left nothing else.  Carrie bought the shoes
and some other things, which complicated the rent problem very
seriously.  Suddenly, a week from the fatal day, Carrie realized that
they were going to run short.

"I don't believe," she exclaimed, looking into her purse at breakfast,
"that I'll have enough to pay the rent."

"How much have you?" inquired Hurstwood.

"Well, I've got twenty-two dollars, but there's everything to be paid
for this week yet, and if I use all I get Saturday to pay this, there
won't be any left for next week.  Do you think your hotel man will open
his hotel this month?"

"I think so," returned Hurstwood.  "He said he would."

After a while, Hurstwood said:

"Don't worry about it.  Maybe the grocer will wait.  He can do that.
We've traded there long enough to make him trust us for a week or two."

"Do you think he will?" she asked.

"I think so." On this account, Hurstwood, this very day, looked grocer
Oeslogge clearly in the eye as he ordered a pound of coffee, and said:

"Do you mind carrying my account until the end of every week?"

"No, no, Mr. Wheeler," said Mr. Oeslogge.  "Dat iss all right."

Hurstwood, still tactful in distress, added nothing to this.  It seemed
an easy thing.  He looked out of the door, and then gathered up his
coffee when ready and came away.  The game of a desperate man had
begun.

Rent was paid, and now came the grocer.  Hurstwood managed by paying
out of his own ten and collecting from Carrie at the end of the week.
Then he delayed a day next time settling with the grocer, and so soon
had his ten back, with Oeslogge getting his pay on this Thursday or
Friday for last Saturday's bill.

This entanglement made Carrie anxious for a change of some sort.
Hurstwood did not seem to realize that she had a right to anything.  He
schemed to make what she earned cover all expenses, but seemed not to
trouble over adding anything himself.

"He talks about worrying," thought Carrie.  "If he worried enough he
couldn't sit there and wait for me.  He'd get something to do. No man
could go seven months without finding something if he tried."

The sight of him always around in his untidy clothes and gloomy
appearance drove Carrie to seek relief in other places.  Twice a week
there were matinees, and then Hurstwood ate a cold snack, which he
prepared himself.  Two other days there were rehearsals beginning at
ten in the morning and lasting usually until one. Now, to this Carrie
added a few visits to one or two chorus girls, including the blue-eyed
soldier of the golden helmet.  She did it because it was pleasant and a
relief from dullness of the home over which her husband brooded.

The blue-eyed soldier's name was Osborne--Lola Osborne.  Her room was
in Nineteenth Street near Fourth Avenue, a block now given up wholly to
office buildings.  Here she had a comfortable back room, looking over a
collection of back yards in which grew a number of shade trees pleasant
to see.

"Isn't your home in New York?" she asked of Lola one day.

"Yes; but I can't get along with my people.  They always want me to do
what they want.  Do you live here?"

"Yes," said Carrie.

"With your family?"

Carrie was ashamed to say that she was married.  She had talked so much
about getting more salary and confessed to so much anxiety about her
future, that now, when the direct question of fact was waiting, she
could not tell this girl.

"With some relatives," she answered.

Miss Osborne took it for granted that, like herself, Carrie's time was
her own.  She invariably asked her to stay, proposing little outings
and other things of that sort until Carrie began neglecting her dinner
hours.  Hurstwood noticed it, but felt in no position to quarrel with
her.  Several times she came so late as scarcely to have an hour in
which to patch up a meal and start for the theatre.

"Do you rehearse in the afternoons?" Hurstwood once asked, concealing
almost completely the cynical protest and regret which prompted it.

"No; I was looking around for another place," said Carrie.

As a matter of fact she was, but only in such a way as furnished the
least straw of an excuse.  Miss Osborne and she had gone to the office
of the manager who was to produce the new opera at the Broadway and
returned straight to the former's room, where they had been since three
o'clock.

Carrie felt this question to be an infringement on her liberty. She did
not take into account how much liberty she was securing. Only the
latest step, the newest freedom, must not be questioned.

Hurstwood saw it all clearly enough.  He was shrewd after his kind, and
yet there was enough decency in the man to stop him from making any
effectual protest.  In his almost inexplicable apathy he was content to
droop supinely while Carrie drifted out of his life, just as he was
willing supinely to see opportunity pass beyond his control.  He could
not help clinging and protesting in a mild, irritating, and ineffectual
way, however--a way that simply widened the breach by slow degrees.

A further enlargement of this chasm between them came when the manager,
looking between the wings upon the brightly lighted stage where the
chorus was going through some of its glittering evolutions, said to the
master of the ballet:

"Who is that fourth girl there on the right--the one coming round at
the end now?"

"Oh," said the ballet-master, "that's Miss Madenda."

"She's good looking.  Why don't you let her head that line?"

"I will," said the man.

"Just do that.  She'll look better there than the woman you've got."

"All right.  I will do that," said the master.

The next evening Carrie was called out, much as if for an error.

"You lead your company to night," said the master.

"Yes, sir," said Carrie.

"Put snap into it," he added.  "We must have snap."

"Yes, sir," replied Carrie.

Astonished at this change, she thought that the heretofore leader must
be ill; but when she saw her in the line, with a distinct expression of
something unfavorable in her eye, she began to think that perhaps it
was merit.

She had a chic way of tossing her head to one side, and holding her
arms as if for action--not listlessly.  In front of the line this
showed up even more effectually.

"That girl knows how to carry herself," said the manager, another
evening.  He began to think that he should like to talk with her. If he
hadn't made it a rule to have nothing to do with the members of the
chorus, he would have approached her most unbendingly.

"Put that girl at the head of the white column," he suggested to the
man in charge of the ballet.

This white column consisted of some twenty girls, all in snow white
flannel trimmed with silver and blue.  Its leader was most stunningly
arrayed in the same colors, elaborated, however, with epaulets and a
belt of silver, with a short sword dangling at one side.  Carrie was
fitted for this costume, and a few days later appeared, proud of her
new laurels.  She was especially gratified to find that her salary was
now eighteen instead of twelve.

Hurstwood heard nothing about this.

"I'll not give him the rest of my money," said Carrie.  "I do enough.
I am going to get me something to wear."

As a matter of fact, during this second month she had been buying for
herself as recklessly as she dared, regardless of the consequences.
There were impending more complications rent day, and more extension of
the credit system in the neighborhood. Now, however, she proposed to do
better by herself.

Her first move was to buy a shirt waist, and in studying these she
found how little her money would buy--how much, if she could only use
all.  She forgot that if she were alone she would have to pay for a
room and board, and imagined that every cent of her eighteen could be
spent for clothes and things that she liked.

At last she picked upon something, which not only used up all her
surplus above twelve, but invaded that sum.  She knew she was going too
far, but her feminine love of finery prevailed.  The next day Hurstwood
said:

"We owe the grocer five dollars and forty cents this week."

"Do we?" said Carrie, frowning a little.

She looked in her purse to leave it.

"I've only got eight dollars and twenty cents altogether."

"We owe the milkman sixty cents," added Hurstwood.

"Yes, and there's the coal man," said Carrie.

Hurstwood said nothing.  He had seen the new things she was buying; the
way she was neglecting household duties; the readiness with which she
was slipping out afternoons and staying. He felt that something was
going to happen.  All at once she spoke:

"I don't know," she said; "I can't do it all.  I don't earn enough."

This was a direct challenge.  Hurstwood had to take it up.  He tried to
be calm.

"I don't want you to do it all," he said.  "I only want a little help
until I can get something to do."

"Oh, yes," answered Carrie.  "That's always the way.  It takes more
than I can earn to pay for things.  I don't see what I'm going to do.

"Well, I've tried to get something," he exclaimed.  What do you want me
to do?"

"You couldn't have tried so very hard," said Carrie.  "I got
something."

"Well, I did," he said, angered almost to harsh words.  "You needn't
throw up your success to me.  All I asked was a little help until I
could get something.  I'm not down yet.  I'll come up all right."

He tried to speak steadily, but his voice trembled a little.

Carrie's anger melted on the instant.  She felt ashamed.

"Well," she said, "here's the money," and emptied it out on the table.
"I haven't got quite enough to pay it all.  If they can wait until
Saturday, though, I'll have some more."

"You keep it," said Hurstwood sadly.  "I only want enough to pay the
grocer."

She put it back, and proceeded to get dinner early and in good time.
Her little bravado made her feel as if she ought to make amends.

In a little while their old thoughts returned to both.

"She's making more than she says," thought Hurstwood.  "She says she's
making twelve, but that wouldn't buy all those things.  I don't care.
Let her keep her money.  I'll get something again one of these days.
Then she can go to the deuce."

He only said this in his anger, but it prefigured a possible course of
action and attitude well enough.

"I don't care," thought Carrie.  "He ought to be told to get out and do
something.  It isn't right that I should support him."

In these days Carrie was introduced to several youths, friends of Miss
Osborne, who were of the kind most aptly described as gay and festive.
They called once to get Miss Osborne for an afternoon drive.  Carrie
was with her at the time.

"Come and go along," said Lola.

"No, I can't," said Carrie.

"Oh, yes, come and go.  What have you got to do?"

"I have to be home by five," said Carrie.

"What for?"

"Oh, dinner."

"They'll take us to dinner," said Lola.

"Oh, no," said Carrie.  "I won't go.  I can't."

"Oh, do come.  They're awful nice boys.  We'll get you back in time.
We're only going for a drive in Central Park." Carrie thought a while,
and at last yielded.

"Now, I must be back by half-past four," she said.

The information went in one ear of Lola and out the other.

After Drouet and Hurstwood, there was the least touch of cynicism in
her attitude toward young men--especially of the gay and frivolous
sort.  She felt a little older than they.  Some of their pretty
compliments seemed silly.  Still, she was young in heart and body and
youth appealed to her.

"Oh, we'll be right back, Miss Madenda," said one of the chaps, bowing.
"You wouldn't think we'd keep you over time, now, would you?"

"Well, I don't know," said Carrie, smiling.

They were off for a drive--she, looking about and noticing fine
clothing, the young men voicing those silly pleasantries and weak quips
which pass for humor in coy circles.  Carrie saw the great park parade
of carriages, beginning at the Fifty-ninth Street entrance and winding
past the Museum of Art to the exit at One Hundred and Tenth Street and
Seventh Avenue.  Her eye was once more taken by the show of wealth--the
elaborate costumes, elegant harnesses, spirited horses, and, above all,
the beauty.  Once more the plague of poverty galled her, but now she
forgot in a measure her own troubles so far as to forget Hurstwood.  He
waited until four, five, and even six.  It was getting dark when he got
up out of his chair.

"I guess she isn't coming home," he said, grimly.

"That's the way," he thought.  "She's getting a start now.  I'm out of
it."

Carrie had really discovered her neglect, but only at a quarter after
five, and the open carriage was now far up Seventh Avenue, near the
Harlem River.

"What time is it?" she inquired.  "I must be getting back."

"A quarter after five," said her companion, consulting an elegant,
open-faced watch.

"Oh, dear me!" exclaimed Carrie.  Then she settled back with a sigh.
"There's no use crying over spilt milk," she said.  "It's too late."

"Of course it is," said the youth, who saw visions of a fine dinner
now, and such invigorating talk as would result in a reunion after the
show.  He was greatly taken with Carrie. "We'll drive down to
Delmonico's now and have something there, won't we, Orrin?"

"To be sure," replied Orrin, gaily.

Carrie thought of Hurstwood.  Never before had she neglected dinner
without an excuse.

They drove back, and at 6.15 sat down to dine.  It was the Sherry
incident over again, the remembrance of which came painfully back to
Carrie.  She remembered Mrs. Vance, who had never called again after
Hurstwood's reception, and Ames.

At this figure her mind halted.  It was a strong, clean vision. He
liked better books than she read, better people than she associated
with.  His ideals burned in her heart.

"It's fine to be a good actress," came distinctly back.

What sort of an actress was she?

"What are you thinking about, Miss Madenda?" inquired her merry
companion.  "Come, now, let's see if I can guess."

"Oh, no," said Carrie.  "Don't try."

She shook it off and ate.  She forgot, in part, and was merry. When it
came to the after-theatre proposition, however, she shook her head.

"No," she said, "I can't.  I have a previous engagement."

"Oh, now, Miss Madenda," pleaded the youth.

"No," said Carrie, "I can't.  You've been so kind, but you'll have to
excuse me."

The youth looked exceedingly crestfallen.

"Cheer up, old man," whispered his companion.  "We'll go around,
anyhow.  She may change her mind."




Chapter XL
A PUBLIC DISSENSION--A FINAL APPEAL

 There was no after-theatre lark, however, so far as Carrie was
concerned.  She made her way homeward, thinking about her absence.
Hurstwood was asleep, but roused up to look as she passed through to
her own bed.

"Is that you?" he said.

"Yes," she answered.

The next morning at breakfast she felt like apologizing.

"I couldn't get home last evening," she said.

"Ah, Carrie," he answered, "what's the use saying that? I don't care.
You needn't tell me that, though."

"I couldn't," said Carrie, her color rising.  Then, seeing that he
looked as if he said "I know," she exclaimed: "Oh, all right. I don't
care."

>From now on, her indifference to the flat was even greater. There
seemed no common ground on which they could talk to one another.  She
let herself be asked for expenses.  It became so with him that he hated
to do it.  He preferred standing off the butcher and baker.  He ran up
a grocery bill of sixteen dollars with Oeslogge, laying in a supply of
staple articles, so that they would not have to buy any of those things
for some time to come.  Then he changed his grocery.  It was the same
with the butcher and several others.  Carrie never heard anything of
this directly from him. He asked for such as he could expect, drifting
farther and farther into a situation which could have but one ending.

In this fashion, September went by.

"Isn't Mr. Drake going to open his hotel?" Carrie asked several times.

"Yes.  He won't do it before October, though, now."

Carrie became disgusted.  "Such a man," she said to herself frequently.
More and more she visited.  She put most of her spare money in clothes,
which, after all, was not an astonishing amount.  At last the opera she
was with announced its departure within four weeks.  "Last two weeks of
the Great Comic Opera success ----The--------," etc., was upon all
billboards and in the newspapers, before she acted.

"I'm not going out on the road," said Miss Osborne.

Carrie went with her to apply to another manager.

"Ever had any experience?" was one of his questions.

"I'm with the company at the Casino now."

"Oh, you are?" he said.

The end of this was another engagement at twenty per week.

Carrie was delighted.  She began to feel that she had a place in the
world.  People recognized ability.

So changed was her state that the home atmosphere became intolerable.
It was all poverty and trouble there, or seemed to be, because it was a
load to bear.  It became a place to keep away from.  Still she slept
there, and did a fair amount of work, keeping it in order.  It was a
sitting place for Hurstwood.  He sat and rocked, rocked and read,
enveloped in the gloom of his own fate.  October went by, and November.
It was the dead of winter almost before he knew it, and there he sat.

Carrie was doing better, that he knew.  Her clothes were improved now,
even fine.  He saw her coming and going, sometimes picturing to himself
her rise.  Little eating had thinned him somewhat.  He had no appetite.
His clothes, too, were a poor man's clothes. Talk about getting
something had become even too threadbare and ridiculous for him.  So he
folded his hands and waited--for what, he could not anticipate.

At last, however, troubles became too thick.  The hounding of
creditors, the indifference of Carrie, the silence of the flat, and
presence of winter, all joined to produce a climax.  It was effected by
the arrival of Oeslogge, personally, when Carrie was there.

"I call about my bill," said Mr. Oeslogge.

Carrie was only faintly surprised.

"How much is it?" she asked.

"Sixteen dollars," he replied.

"Oh, that much?" said Carrie.  "Is this right?" she asked, turning to
Hurstwood.

"Yes," he said.

"Well, I never heard anything about it."

She looked as if she thought he had been contracting some needless
expense.

"Well, we had it all right," he answered.  Then he went to the door.
"I can't pay you anything on that to-day," he said, mildly.

"Well, when can you?" said the grocer.

"Not before Saturday, anyhow," said Hurstwood.

"Huh!" returned the grocer.  "This is fine.  I must have that.  I need
the money."

Carrie was standing farther back in the room, hearing it all. She was
greatly distressed.  It was so bad and commonplace. Hurstwood was
annoyed also.

"Well," he said, "there's no use talking about it now.  If you'll come
in Saturday, I'll pay you something on it."

The grocery man went away.

"How are we going to pay it?" asked Carrie, astonished by the bill.  "I
can't do it."

"Well, you don't have to," he said.  "He can't get what he can't get.
He'll have to wait."

"I don't see how we ran up such a bill as that," said Carrie.

"Well, we ate it," said Hurstwood.

"It's funny," she replied, still doubting.

"What's the use of your standing there and talking like that, now?" he
asked.  "Do you think I've had it alone? You talk as if I'd taken
something."

"Well, it's too much, anyhow," said Carrie.  "I oughtn't to be made to
pay for it.  I've got more than I can pay for now."

"All right," replied Hurstwood, sitting down in silence.  He was sick
of the grind of this thing.

Carrie went out and there he sat, determining to do something.

There had been appearing in the papers about this time rumors and
notices of an approaching strike on the trolley lines in Brooklyn.
There was general dissatisfaction as to the hours of labor required and
the wages paid.  As usual--and for some inexplicable reason--the men
chose the winter for the forcing of the hand of their employers and the
settlement of their difficulties.

Hurstwood had been reading of this thing, and wondering concerning the
huge tie-up which would follow.  A day or two before this trouble with
Carrie, it came.  On a cold afternoon, when everything was gray and it
threatened to snow, the papers announced that the men had been called
out on all the lines. Being so utterly idle, and his mind filled with
the numerous predictions which had been made concerning the scarcity of
labor this winter and the panicky state of the financial market,
Hurstwood read this with interest.  He noted the claims of the striking
motormen and conductors, who said that they had been wont to receive
two dollars a day in times past, but that for a year or more "trippers"
had been introduced, which cut down their chance of livelihood one-
half, and increased their hours of servitude from ten to twelve, and
even fourteen.  These "trippers" were men put on during the busy and
rush hours, to take a car out for one trip.  The compensation paid for
such a trip was only twenty-five cents.  When the rush or busy hours
were over, they were laid off.  Worst of all, no man might know when he
was going to get a car.  He must come to the barns in the morning and
wait around in fair and foul weather until such time as he was needed.
Two trips were an average reward for so much waiting--a little over
three hours' work for fifty cents.  The work of waiting was not
counted.

The men complained that this system was extending, and that the time
was not far off when but a few out of 7,000 employees would have
regular two-dollar-a-day work at all.  They demanded that the system be
abolished, and that ten hours be considered a day's work, barring
unavoidable delays, with $2.25 pay.  They demanded immediate acceptance
of these terms, which the various trolley companies refused.

Hurstwood at first sympathized with the demands of these men-indeed, it
is a question whether he did not always sympathize with them to the
end, belie him as his actions might.  Reading nearly all the news, he
was attracted first by the scare-heads with which the trouble was noted
in the "World." He read it fully--the names of the seven companies
involved, the number of men.

"They're foolish to strike in this sort of weather," he thought to
himself.  "Let 'em win if they can, though."

The next day there was even a larger notice of it.  "Brooklynites
Walk," said the "World." "Knights of Labor Tie up the Trolley Lines
Across the Bridge." "About Seven Thousand Men Out."

Hurstwood read this, formulating to himself his own idea of what would
be the outcome.  He was a great believer in the strength of
corporations.

"They can't win," he said, concerning the men.  "They haven't any
money.  The police will protect the companies.  They've got to. The
public has to have its cars."

He didn't sympathize with the corporations, but strength was with them.
So was property and public utility.

"Those fellows can't win," he thought.

Among other things, he noticed a circular issued by one of the
companies, which read:

                            ATLANTIC AVENUE RAILROAD

                                         SPECIAL NOTICE

The motormen and conductors and other employees of this company having
abruptly left its service, an opportunity is now given to all loyal men
who have struck against their will to be reinstated, providing they
will make their applications by twelve o'clock noon on Wednesday,
January 16th.  Such men will be given employment (with guaranteed
protection) in the order in which such applications are received, and
runs and positions assigned them accordingly.  Otherwise, they will be
considered discharged, and every vacancy will be filled by a new man as
soon as his services can be secured.                       (Signed)
Benjamin Norton,                                      President

 He also noted among the want ads.  one which read:

 WANTED.--50 skilled motormen, accustomed to Westinghouse system, to
run U.S. mail cars only, in the City of Brooklyn; protection
guaranteed.

 He noted particularly in each the "protection guaranteed." It
signified to him the unassailable power of the companies.

"They've got the militia on their side," he thought.  "There isn't
anything those men can do."

While this was still in his mind, the incident with Oeslogge and Carrie
occurred.  There had been a good deal to irritate him, but this seemed
much the worst.  Never before had she accused him of stealing--or very
near that.  She doubted the naturalness of so large a bill.  And he had
worked so hard to make expenses seem light.  He had been "doing"
butcher and baker in order not to call on her.  He had eaten very
little--almost nothing.

"Damn it all!" he said.  "I can get something.  I'm not down yet."

He thought that he really must do something now.  It was too cheap to
sit around after such an insinuation as this.  Why, after a little, he
would be standing anything.

He got up and looked out the window into the chilly street.  It came
gradually into his mind, as he stood there, to go to Brooklyn.

"Why not?" his mind said.  "Any one can get work over there. You'll get
two a day."

"How about accidents?" said a voice.  "You might get hurt."

"Oh, there won't be much of that," he answered.  "They've called out
the police.  Any one who wants to run a car will be protected all
right."

"You don't know how to run a car," rejoined the voice.

"I won't apply as a motorman," he answered.  "I can ring up fares all
right."

"They'll want motormen, mostly."

"They'll take anybody; that I know."

For several hours he argued pro and con with this mental counselor,
feeling no need to act at once in a matter so sure of profit.

In the morning he put on his best clothes, which were poor enough, and
began stirring about, putting some bread and meat into a page of a
newspaper.  Carrie watched him, interested in this new move.

"Where are you going?" she asked.

"Over to Brooklyn," he answered.  Then, seeing her still inquisitive,
he added: "I think I can get on over there."

"On the trolley lines?" said Carrie, astonished.

"Yes," he rejoined.

"Aren't you afraid?" she asked.

"What of?" he answered.  "The police are protecting them."

"The paper said four men were hurt yesterday."

"Yes," he returned; "but you can't go by what the papers say. They'll
run the cars all right."

He looked rather determined now, in a desolate sort of way, and Carrie
felt very sorry.  Something of the old Hurstwood was here-the least
shadow of what was once shrewd and pleasant strength. Outside, it was
cloudy and blowing a few flakes of snow.

"What a day to go over there," thought Carrie.

Now he left before she did, which was a remarkable thing, and tramped
eastward to Fourteenth Street and Sixth Avenue, where he took the car.
He had read that scores of applicants were applying at the office of
the Brooklyn City Railroad building and were being received.  He made
his way there by horse-car and ferry--a dark, silent man--to the
offices in question.  It was a long way, for no cars were running, and
the day was cold; but he trudged along grimly.  Once in Brooklyn, he
could clearly see and feel that a strike was on.  People showed it in
their manner. Along the routes of certain tracks not a car was running.
About certain corners and nearby saloons small groups of men were
lounging.  Several spring wagons passed him, equipped with plain wooden
chairs, and labeled "Flatbush" or "Prospect Park.  Fare, Ten Cents." He
noticed cold and even gloomy faces.  Labor was having its little war.

When he came near the office in question, he saw a few men standing
about, and some policemen.  On the far corners were other men--whom he
took to be strikers--watching.  All the houses were small and wooden,
the streets poorly paved.  After New York, Brooklyn looked actually
poor and hard-up.

He made his way into the heart of the small group, eyed by policemen
and the men already there.  One of the officers addressed him.

"What are you looking for?"

"I want to see if I can get a place."

"The offices are up those steps," said the bluecoat.  His face was a
very neutral thing to contemplate.  In his heart of hearts, he
sympathized with the strikers and hated this "scab." In his heart of
hearts, also, he felt the dignity and use of the police force, which
commanded order.  Of its true social significance, he never once
dreamed.  His was not the mind for that.  The two feelings blended in
him--neutralized one another and him.  He would have fought for this
man as determinedly as for himself, and yet only so far as commanded.
Strip him of his uniform, and he would have soon picked his side.

Hurstwood ascended a dusty flight of steps and entered a small, dust-
colored office, in which were a railing, a long desk, and several
clerks.

"Well, sir?" said a middle-aged man, looking up at him from the long
desk.

"Do you want to hire any men?" inquired Hurstwood.

"What are you--a motorman?"

"No; I'm not anything," said Hurstwood.

He was not at all abashed by his position.  He knew these people needed
men.  If one didn't take him, another would.  This man could take him
or leave him, just as he chose.

"Well, we prefer experienced men, of course," said the man.  He paused,
while Hurstwood smiled indifferently.  Then he added: "Still, I guess
you can learn.  What is your name?"

"Wheeler," said Hurstwood.

The man wrote an order on a small card.  "Take that to our barns," he
said, "and give it to the foreman.  He'll show you what to do."

Hurstwood went down and out.  He walked straight away in the direction
indicated, while the policemen looked after.

"There's another wants to try it," said Officer Kiely to Officer Macey.

"I have my mind he'll get his fill," returned the latter, quietly.
They had been in strikes before.




Chapter XLI
THE STRIKE

 The barn at which Hurstwood applied was exceedingly short-handed, and
was being operated practically by three men as directors. There were a
lot of green hands around--queer, hungry-looking men, who looked as if
want had driven them to desperate means. They tried to be lively and
willing, but there was an air of hang-dog diffidence about the place.

Hurstwood went back through the barns and out into a large, enclosed
lot, where were a series of tracks and loops.  A half dozen cars were
there, manned by instructors, each with a pupil at the lever.  More
pupils were waiting at one of the rear doors of the barn.

In silence Hurstwood viewed this scene, and waited.  His companions
took his eye for a while, though they did not interest him much more
than the cars.  They were an uncomfortable-looking gang, however.  One
or two were very thin and lean.  Several were quite stout.  Several
others were rawboned and sallow, as if they had been beaten upon by all
sorts of rough weather.

"Did you see by the paper they are going to call out the militia?"
Hurstwood heard one of them remark.

"Oh, they'll do that," returned the other.  "They always do."

"Think we're liable to have much trouble?" said another, whom Hurstwood
did not see.

"Not very."

"That Scotchman that went out on the last car," put in a voice, "told
me that they hit him in the ear with a cinder."

A small, nervous laugh accompanied this.

"One of those fellows on the Fifth Avenue line must have had a hell of
a time, according to the papers," drawled another.  "They broke his car
windows and pulled him off into the street 'fore the police could stop
'em."

"Yes; but there are more police around to-day," was added by another.

Hurstwood hearkened without much mental comment.  These talkers seemed
scared to him.  Their gabbling was feverish--things said to quiet their
own minds.  He looked out into the yard and waited.

Two of the men got around quite near him, but behind his back. They
were rather social, and he listened to what they said.

"Are you a railroad man?" said one.

"Me? No.  I've always worked in a paper factory."

"I had a job in Newark until last October," returned the other, with
reciprocal feeling.

There were some words which passed too low to hear.  Then the
conversation became strong again.

"I don't blame these fellers for striking," said one.  "They've got the
right of it, all right, but I had to get something to do."

"Same here," said the other.  "If I had any job in Newark I wouldn't be
over here takin' chances like these."

"It's hell these days, ain't it?" said the man.  "A poor man ain't
nowhere.  You could starve, by God, right in the streets, and there
ain't most no one would help you."

"Right you are," said the other.  "The job I had I lost 'cause they
shut down.  They run all summer and lay up a big stock, and then shut
down."

Hurstwood paid some little attention to this.  Somehow, he felt a
little superior to these two--a little better off.  To him these were
ignorant and commonplace, poor sheep in a driver's hand.

"Poor devils," he thought, speaking out of the thoughts and feelings of
a bygone period of success. "Next," said one of the instructors.

"You're next," said a neighbor, touching him.

He went out and climbed on the platform.  The instructor took it for
granted that no preliminaries were needed.

"You see this handle," he said, reaching up to an electric cutoff,
which was fastened to the roof.  "This throws the current off or on.
If you want to reverse the car you turn it over here. If you want to
send it forward, you put it over here.  If you want to cut off the
power, you keep it in the middle."

Hurstwood smiled at the simple information.

"Now, this handle here regulates your speed.  To here," he said,
pointing with his finger, "gives you about four miles an hour. This is
eight.  When it's full on, you make about fourteen miles an hour."

Hurstwood watched him calmly.  He had seen motormen work before. He
knew just about how they did it, and was sure he could do as well, with
a very little practice.

The instructor explained a few more details, and then said:

"Now, we'll back her up."

Hurstwood stood placidly by, while the car rolled back into the yard.

"One thing you want to be careful about, and that is to start easy.
Give one degree time to act before you start another.  The one fault of
most men is that they always want to throw her wide open.  That's bad.
It's dangerous, too.  Wears out the motor. You don't want to do that."

"I see," said Hurstwood.

He waited and waited, while the man talked on.

"Now you take it," he said, finally.

The ex-manager laid hand to the lever and pushed it gently, as he
thought.  It worked much easier than he imagined, however, with the
result that the car jerked quickly forward, throwing him back against
the door.  He straightened up sheepishly, while the instructor stopped
the car with the brake.

"You want to be careful about that," was all he said.

Hurstwood found, however, that handling a brake and regulating speed
were not so instantly mastered as he had imagined.  Once or twice he
would have ploughed through the rear fence if it had not been for the
hand and word of his companion.  The latter was rather patient with
him, but he never smiled.

"You've got to get the knack of working both arms at once," he said.
"It takes a little practice."

One o'clock came while he was still on the car practicing, and he began
to feel hungry.  The day set in snowing, and he was cold. He grew weary
of running to and fro on the short track.

They ran the car to the end and both got off.  Hurstwood went into the
barn and sought a car step, pulling out his paper wrapped lunch from
his pocket.  There was no water and the bread was dry, but he enjoyed
it.  There was no ceremony about dining. He swallowed and looked about,
contemplating the dull, homely labor of the thing.  It was
disagreeable--miserably disagreeable--in all its phases.  Not because
it was bitter, but because it was hard.  It would be hard to any one,
he thought.

After eating, he stood about as before, waiting until his turn came.

The intention was to give him an afternoon of practice, but the greater
part of the time was spent in waiting about.

At last evening came, and with it hunger and a debate with himself as
to how he should spend the night.  It was half-past five.  He must soon
eat.  If he tried to go home, it would take him two hours and a half of
cold walking and riding.  Besides he had orders to report at seven the
next morning, and going home would necessitate his rising at an unholy
and disagreeable hour. He had only something like a dollar and fifteen
cents of Carrie's money, with which he had intended to pay the two
weeks' coal bill before the present idea struck him.

"They must have some place around here," he thought.  "Where does that
fellow from Newark stay?"

Finally he decided to ask.  There was a young fellow standing near one
of the doors in the cold, waiting a last turn.  He was a mere boy in
years--twenty-one about--but with a body lank and long, because of
privation.  A little good living would have made this youth plump and
swaggering.

"How do they arrange this, if a man hasn't any money?" inquired
Hurstwood, discreetly.

The fellow turned a keen, watchful face on the inquirer.

"You mean eat?" he replied.

"Yes, and sleep.  I can't go back to New York to-night."

"The foreman'll fix that if you ask him, I guess.  He did me."

"That so?"

"Yes.  I just told him I didn't have anything.  Gee, I couldn't go
home.  I live way over in Hoboken."

Hurstwood only cleared his throat by way of acknowledgment.

"They've got a place upstairs here, I understand.  I don't know what
sort of a thing it is.  Purty tough, I guess.  He gave me a meal ticket
this noon.  I know that wasn't much."

Hurstwood smiled grimly, and the boy laughed.

"It ain't no fun, is it?" he inquired, wishing vainly for a cheery
reply.

"Not much," answered Hurstwood.

"I'd tackle him now," volunteered the youth.  "He may go 'way."

Hurstwood did so.

"Isn't there some place I can stay around here to-night?" he inquired.
"If I have to go back to New York, I'm afraid I won't"

"There're some cots upstairs," interrupted the man, "if you want one of
them."

"That'll do," he assented.

He meant to ask for a meal ticket, but the seemingly proper moment
never came, and he decided to pay himself that night.

"I'll ask him in the morning."

He ate in a cheap restaurant in the vicinity, and, being cold and
lonely, went straight off to seek the loft in question.  The company
was not attempting to run cars after nightfall.  It was so advised by
the police.

The room seemed to have been a lounging place for night workers. There
were some nine cots in the place, two or three wooden chairs, a soap
box, and a small, round-bellied stove, in which a fire was blazing.
Early as he was, another man was there before him.  The latter was
sitting beside the stove warming his hands.

Hurstwood approached and held out his own toward the fire.  He was sick
of the bareness and privation of all things connected with his venture,
but was steeling himself to hold out.  He fancied he could for a while.

"Cold, isn't it?" said the early guest.

"Rather."

A long silence.

"Not much of a place to sleep in, is it?" said the man.

"Better than nothing," replied Hurstwood.

Another silence.

"I believe I'll turn in," said the man.

Rising, he went to one of the cots and stretched himself, removing only
his shoes, and pulling the one blanket and dirty old comforter over him
in a sort of bundle.  The sight disgusted Hurstwood, but he did not
dwell on it, choosing to gaze into the stove and think of something
else.  Presently he decided to retire, and picked a cot, also removing
his shoes.

While he was doing so, the youth who had advised him to come here
entered, and, seeing Hurstwood, tried to be genial.

"Better'n nothin'," he observed, looking around.

Hurstwood did not take this to himself.  He thought it to be an
expression of individual satisfaction, and so did not answer. The youth
imagined he was out of sorts, and set to whistling softly.  Seeing
another man asleep, he quit that and lapsed into silence.

Hurstwood made the best of a bad lot by keeping on his clothes and
pushing away the dirty covering from his head, but at last he dozed in
sheer weariness.  The covering became more and more comfortable, its
character was forgotten, and he pulled it about his neck and slept. In
the morning he was aroused out of a pleasant dream by several men
stirring about in the cold, cheerless room.  He had been back in
Chicago in fancy, in his own comfortable home.  Jessica had been
arranging to go somewhere, and he had been talking with her about it.
This was so clear in his mind, that he was startled now by the contrast
of this room.  He raised his head, and the cold, bitter reality jarred
him into wakefulness.

"Guess I'd better get up," he said.

There was no water on this floor.  He put on his shoes in the cold and
stood up, shaking himself in his stiffness.  His clothes felt
disagreeable, his hair bad.

"Hell!" he muttered, as he put on his hat.

Downstairs things were stirring again.

He found a hydrant, with a trough which had once been used for horses,
but there was no towel here, and his handkerchief was soiled from
yesterday.  He contented himself with wetting his eyes with the ice-
cold water.  Then he sought the foreman, who was already on the ground.

"Had your breakfast yet?" inquired that worthy.

"No," said Hurstwood.

"Better get it, then; your car won't be ready for a little while."

Hurstwood hesitated.

"Could you let me have a meal ticket?" he asked with an effort.

"Here you are," said the man, handing him one.

He breakfasted as poorly as the night before on some fried steak and
bad coffee.  Then he went back.

"Here," said the foreman, motioning him, when he came in.  "You take
this car out in a few minutes."

Hurstwood climbed up on the platform in the gloomy barn and waited for
a signal.  He was nervous, and yet the thing was a relief.  Anything
was better than the barn.

On this the fourth day of the strike, the situation had taken a turn
for the worse.  The strikers, following the counsel of their leaders
and the newspapers, had struggled peaceably enough. There had been no
great violence done.  Cars had been stopped, it is true, and the men
argued with.  Some crews had been won over and led away, some windows
broken, some jeering and yelling done; but in no more than five or six
instances had men been seriously injured.  These by crowds whose acts
the leaders disclaimed.

Idleness, however, and the sight of the company, backed by the police,
triumphing, angered the men.  They saw that each day more cars were
going on, each day more declarations were being made by the company
officials that the effective opposition of the strikers was broken.
This put desperate thoughts in the minds of the men.  Peaceful methods
meant, they saw, that the companies would soon run all their cars and
those who had complained would be forgotten.  There was nothing so
helpful to the companies as peaceful methods. All at once they blazed
forth, and for a week there was storm and stress.  Cars were assailed,
men attacked, policemen struggled with, tracks torn up, and shots
fired, until at last street fights and mob movements became frequent,
and the city was invested with militia.

Hurstwood knew nothing of the change of temper.

"Run your car out," called the foreman, waving a vigorous hand at him.
A green conductor jumped up behind and rang the bell twice as a signal
to start.  Hurstwood turned the lever and ran the car out through the
door into the street in front of the barn.  Here two brawny policemen
got up beside him on the platform--one on either hand.

At the sound of a gong near the barn door, two bells were given by the
conductor and Hurstwood opened his lever.

The two policemen looked about them calmly.

"'Tis cold, all right, this morning," said the one on the left, who
possessed a rich brogue.

"I had enough of it yesterday," said the other.  "I wouldn't want a
steady job of this."

"Nor I."

Neither paid the slightest attention to Hurstwood, who stood facing the
cold wind, which was chilling him completely, and thinking of his
orders.

"Keep a steady gait," the foreman had said.  "Don't stop for any one
who doesn't look like a real passenger.  Whatever you do, don't stop
for a crowd."

The two officers kept silent for a few moments.

"The last man must have gone through all right," said the officer on
the left.  "I don't see his car anywhere."

"Who's on there?" asked the second officer, referring, of course, to
its complement of policemen.

"Schaeffer and Ryan."

There was another silence, in which the car ran smoothly along. There
were not so many houses along this part of the way. Hurstwood did not
see many people either.  The situation was not wholly disagreeable to
him.  If he were not so cold, he thought he would do well enough.

He was brought out of this feeling by the sudden appearance of a curve
ahead, which he had not expected.  He shut off the current and did an
energetic turn at the brake, but not in time to avoid an unnaturally
quick turn.  It shook him up and made him feel like making some
apologetic remarks, but he refrained.

"You want to look out for them things," said the officer on the left,
condescendingly.

"That's right," agreed Hurstwood, shamefacedly.

"There's lots of them on this line," said the officer on the right.
Around the corner a more populated way appeared.  One or two
pedestrians were in view ahead.  A boy coming out of a gate with a tin
milk bucket gave Hurstwood his first objectionable greeting.

"Scab!" he yelled.  "Scab!"

Hurstwood heard it, but tried to make no comment, even to himself.  He
knew he would get that, and much more of the same sort, probably.

At a corner farther up a man stood by the track and signaled the car to
stop.

"Never mind him," said one of the officers.  "He's up to some game."

Hurstwood obeyed.  At the corner he saw the wisdom of it.  No sooner
did the man perceive the intention to ignore him, than he shook his
fist.

"Ah, you bloody coward!" he yelled.

Some half dozen men, standing on the corner, flung taunts and jeers
after the speeding car.

Hurstwood winced the least bit.  The real thing was slightly worse than
the thoughts of it had been.

Now came in sight, three or four blocks farther on, a heap of something
on the track.

"They've been at work, here, all right," said one of the policemen.

"We'll have an argument, maybe," said the other.

Hurstwood ran the car close and stopped.  He had not done so wholly,
however, before a crowd gathered about.  It was composed of ex-motormen
and conductors in part, with a sprinkling of friends and sympathizers.

"Come off the car, pardner," said one of the men in a voice meant to be
conciliatory.  "You don't want to take the bread out of another man's
mouth, do you?"

Hurstwood held to his brake and lever, pale and very uncertain what to
do.

"Stand back," yelled one of the officers, leaning over the platform
railing.  "Clear out of this, now.  Give the man a chance to do his
work."

"Listen, pardner," said the leader, ignoring the policeman and
addressing Hurstwood.  "We're all working men, like yourself.  If you
were a regular motorman, and had been treated as we've been, you
wouldn't want any one to come in and take your place, would you? You
wouldn't want any one to do you out of your chance to get your rights,
would you?"

"Shut her off! shut her off!" urged the other of the policemen,
roughly.  "Get out of this, now," and he jumped the railing and landed
before the crowd and began shoving.  Instantly the other officer was
down beside him.

"Stand back, now," they yelled.  "Get out of this.  What the hell do
you mean? Out, now."

It was like a small swarm of bees.

"Don't shove me," said one of the strikers, determinedly.  "I'm not
doing anything."

"Get out of this!" cried the officer, swinging his club.  "I'll give ye
a bat on the sconce.  Back, now."

"What the hell!" cried another of the strikers, pushing the other way,
adding at the same time some lusty oaths.

Crack came an officer's club on his forehead.  He blinked his eyes
blindly a few times, wobbled on his legs, threw up his hands, and
staggered back.  In return, a swift fist landed on the officer's neck.

Infuriated by this, the latter plunged left and right, laying about
madly with his club.  He was ably assisted by his brother of the blue,
who poured ponderous oaths upon the troubled waters. No severe damage
was done, owing to the agility of the strikers in keeping out of reach.
They stood about the sidewalk now and jeered.

"Where is the conductor?" yelled one of the officers, getting his eye
on that individual, who had come nervously forward to stand by
Hurstwood.  The latter had stood gazing upon the scene with more
astonishment than fear.

"Why don't you come down here and get these stones off the track?"
inquired the officer.  "What you standing there for? Do you want to
stay here all day? Get down."

Hurstwood breathed heavily in excitement and jumped down with the
nervous conductor as if he had been called.

"Hurry up, now," said the other policeman.

Cold as it was, these officers were hot and mad.  Hurstwood worked with
the conductor, lifting stone after stone and warming himself by the
work.

"Ah, you scab, you!" yelled the crowd.  "You coward! Steal a man's job,
will you? Rob the poor, will you, you thief? We'll get you yet, now.
Wait."

Not all of this was delivered by one man.  It came from here and there,
incorporated with much more of the same sort and curses.

"Work, you blackguards," yelled a voice.  "Do the dirty work. You're
the suckers that keep the poor people down!"

"May God starve ye yet," yelled an old Irish woman, who now threw open
a nearby window and stuck out her head.

"Yes, and you," she added, catching the eye of one of the policemen.
"You bloody, murtherin' thafe! Crack my son over the head, will you,
you hardhearted, murtherin' divil? Ah, ye----"

But the officer turned a deaf ear.

"Go to the devil, you old hag," he half muttered as he stared round
upon the scattered company.

Now the stones were off, and Hurstwood took his place again amid a
continued chorus of epithets.  Both officers got up beside him and the
conductor rang the bell, when, bang! bang! through window and door came
rocks and stones.  One narrowly grazed Hurstwood's head.  Another
shattered the window behind.

"Throw open your lever," yelled one of the officers, grabbing at the
handle himself.

Hurstwood complied and the car shot away, followed by a rattle of
stones and a rain of curses.

"That ---------hit me in the neck," said one of the officers.  "I gave
him a good crack for it, though."

"I think I must have left spots on some of them," said the other.

"I know that big guy that called us a ----------" said the first.
"I'll get him yet for that."

"I thought we were in for it sure, once there," said the second.

Hurstwood, warmed and excited, gazed steadily ahead.  It was an
astonishing experience for him.  He had read of these things, but the
reality seemed something altogether new.  He was no coward in spirit.
The fact that he had suffered this much now rather operated to arouse a
stolid determination to stick it out.  He did not recur in thought to
New York or the flat.  This one trip seemed a consuming thing.

They now ran into the business heart of Brooklyn uninterrupted. People
gazed at the broken windows of the car and at Hurstwood in his plain
clothes.  Voices called "scab" now and then, as well as other epithets,
but no crowd attacked the car.  At the downtown end of the line, one of
the officers went to call up his station and report the trouble.

"There's a gang out there," he said, "laying for us yet.  Better send
some one over there and clean them out."

The car ran back more quietly--hooted, watched, flung at, but not
attacked.  Hurstwood breathed freely when he saw the barns.

"Well," he observed to himself, "I came out of that all right."

The car was turned in and he was allowed to loaf a while, but later he
was again called.  This time a new team of officers was aboard.
Slightly more confident, he sped the car along the commonplace streets
and felt somewhat less fearful.  On one side, however, he suffered
intensely.  The day was raw, with a sprinkling of snow and a gusty
wind, made all the more intolerable by the speed of the car.  His
clothing was not intended for this sort of work.  He shivered, stamped
his feet, and beat his arms as he had seen other motormen do in the
past, but said nothing.  The novelty and danger of the situation
modified in a way his disgust and distress at being compelled to be
here, but not enough to prevent him from feeling grim and sour.  This
was a dog's life, he thought.  It was a tough thing to have to come to.

The one thought that strengthened him was the insult offered by Carrie.
He was not down so low as to take all that, he thought. He could do
something--this, even--for a while.  It would get better.  He would
save a little.

A boy threw a clod of mud while he was thus reflecting and hit him upon
the arm.  It hurt sharply and angered him more than he had been any
time since morning.

"The little cur!" he muttered.

"Hurt you?" asked one of the policemen.

"No," he answered.

At one of the corners, where the car slowed up because of a turn, an
ex-motorman, standing on the sidewalk, called to him:

"Won't you come out, pardner, and be a man? Remember we're fighting for
decent day's wages, that's all.  We've got families to support." The
man seemed most peaceably inclined.

Hurstwood pretended not to see him.  He kept his eyes straight on
before and opened the lever wide.  The voice had something appealing in
it.

All morning this went on and long into the afternoon.  He made three
such trips.  The dinner he had was no stay for such work and the cold
was telling on him.  At each end of the line he stopped to thaw out,
but he could have groaned at the anguish of it.  One of the barn men,
out of pity, loaned him a heavy cap and a pair of sheepskin gloves, and
for once he was extremely thankful.

On the second trip of the afternoon he ran into a crowd about half way
along the line, that had blocked the car's progress with an old
telegraph pole.

"Get that thing off the track," shouted the two policemen.

"Yah, yah, yah!" yelled the crowd.  "Get it off yourself."

The two policemen got down and Hurstwood started to follow.

"You stay there," one called.  "Some one will run away with your car."

Amid the babble of voices, Hurstwood heard one close beside him.

"Come down, pardner, and be a man.  Don't fight the poor.  Leave that
to the corporations."

He saw the same fellow who had called to him from the corner. Now, as
before, he pretended not to hear him.

"Come down," the man repeated gently.  "You don't want to fight poor
men.  Don't fight at all." It was a most philosophic and Jesuitical
motorman.

A third policeman joined the other two from somewhere and some one ran
to telephone for more officers.  Hurstwood gazed about, determined but
fearful.

A man grabbed him by the coat.

"Come off of that," he exclaimed, jerking at him and trying to pull him
over the railing.

"Let go," said Hurstwood, savagely.

"I'll show you--you scab!" cried a young Irishman, jumping up on the
car and aiming a blow at Hurstwood.  The latter ducked and caught it on
the shoulder instead of the jaw.

"Away from here," shouted an officer, hastening to the rescue, and
adding, of course, the usual oaths.

Hurstwood recovered himself, pale and trembling.  It was becoming
serious with him now.  People were looking up and jeering at him. One
girl was making faces.

He began to waver in his resolution, when a patrol wagon rolled up and
more officers dismounted.  Now the track was quickly cleared and the
release effected.

"Let her go now, quick," said the officer, and again he was off.

The end came with a real mob, which met the car on its return trip a
mile or two from the barns.  It was an exceedingly poor looking
neighborhood.  He wanted to run fast through it, but again the track
was blocked.  He saw men carrying something out to it when he was yet a
half-dozen blocks away.

"There they are again!" exclaimed one policeman.

"I'll give them something this time," said the second officer, whose
patience was becoming worn.  Hurstwood suffered a qualm of body as the
car rolled up.  As before, the crowd began hooting, but now, rather
than come near, they threw things.  One or two windows were smashed and
Hurstwood dodged a stone.

Both policemen ran out toward the crowd, but the latter replied by
running toward the car.  A woman--a mere girl in appearance-was among
these, bearing a rough stick.  She was exceedingly wrathful and struck
at Hurstwood, who dodged.  Thereupon, her companions, duly encouraged,
jumped on the car and pulled Hurstwood over.  He had hardly time to
speak or shout before he fell.

"Let go of me," he said, falling on his side.

"Ah, you sucker," he heard some one say.  Kicks and blows rained on
him.  He seemed to be suffocating.  Then two men seemed to be dragging
him off and he wrestled for freedom.

"Let up," said a voice, "you're all right.  Stand up."

He was let loose and recovered himself.  Now he recognized two
officers.  He felt as if he would faint from exhaustion. Something was
wet on his chin.  He put up his hand and felt, then looked.  It was
red.

"They cut me," he said, foolishly, fishing for his handkerchief.

"Now, now," said one of the officers.  "It's only a scratch."

His senses became cleared now and he looked around.  He was standing in
a little store, where they left him for the moment. Outside, he could
see, as he stood wiping his chin, the car and the excited crowd.  A
patrol wagon was there, and another.

He walked over and looked out.  It was an ambulance, backing in.

He saw some energetic charging by the police and arrests being made.

"Come on, now, if you want to take your car," said an officer, opening
the door and looking in. He walked out, feeling rather uncertain of
himself.  He was very cold and frightened.

"Where's the conductor?" he asked.

"Oh, he's not here now," said the policeman.

Hurstwood went toward the car and stepped nervously on.  As he did so
there was a pistol shot.  Something stung his shoulder.

"Who fired that?" he heard an officer exclaim.  "By God! who did that?"
Both left him, running toward a certain building.  He paused a moment
and then got down.

"George!" exclaimed Hurstwood, weakly, "this is too much for me."

He walked nervously to the corner and hurried down a side street.

"Whew!" he said, drawing in his breath.

A half block away, a small girl gazed at him.

"You'd better sneak," she called.

He walked homeward in a blinding snowstorm, reaching the ferry by dusk.
The cabins were filled with comfortable souls, who studied him
curiously.  His head was still in such a whirl that he felt confused.
All the wonder of the twinkling lights of the river in a white storm
passed for nothing.  He trudged doggedly on until he reached the flat.
There he entered and found the room warm. Carrie was gone.  A couple of
evening papers were lying on the table where she left them.  He lit the
gas and sat down.  Then he got up and stripped to examine his shoulder.
It was a mere scratch.  He washed his hands and face, still in a brown
study, apparently, and combed his hair.  Then he looked for something
to eat, and finally, his hunger gone, sat down in his comfortable
rocking-chair.  It was a wonderful relief.

He put his hand to his chin, forgetting, for the moment, the papers.

"Well," he said, after a time, his nature recovering itself, "that's a
pretty tough game over there."

Then he turned and saw the papers.  With half a sigh he picked up the
"World."

"Strike Spreading in Brooklyn," he read.  "Rioting Breaks Out in all
Parts of the City."

He adjusted his paper very comfortably and continued.  It was the one
thing he read with absorbing interest.




Chapter XLII
A TOUCH OF SPRING--THE EMPTY SHELL

 Those who look upon Hurstwood's Brooklyn venture as an error of
judgment will none the less realize the negative influence on him of
the fact that he had tried and failed.  Carrie got a wrong idea of it.
He said so little that she imagined he had encountered nothing worse
than the ordinary roughness--quitting so soon in the face of this
seemed trifling.  He did not want to work.

She was now one of a group of oriental beauties who, in the second act
of the comic opera, were paraded by the vizier before the new potentate
as the treasures of his harem.  There was no word assigned to any of
them, but on the evening when Hurstwood was housing himself in the loft
of the street-car barn, the leading comedian and star, feeling
exceedingly facetious, said in a profound voice, which created a ripple
of laughter:

"Well, who are you?"

It merely happened to be Carrie who was curtsying before him. It might
as well have been any of the others, so far as he was concerned.  He
expected no answer and a dull one would have been reproved.  But
Carrie, whose experience and belief in herself gave her daring,
curtsied sweetly again and answered:

"I am yours truly."

It was a trivial thing to say, and yet something in the way she did it
caught the audience, which laughed heartily at the mock fierce
potentate towering before the young woman.  The comedian also liked it,
hearing the laughter.

"I thought your name was Smith," he returned, endeavoring to get the
last laugh.

Carrie almost trembled for her daring after she had said this. All
members of the company had been warned that to interpolate lines or
"business" meant a fine or worse.  She did not know what to think.

As she was standing in her proper position in the wings, awaiting
another entry, the great comedian made his exit past her and paused in
recognition.

"You can just leave that in hereafter," he remarked, seeing how
intelligent she appeared.  "Don't add any more, though."

"Thank you," said Carrie, humbly.  When he went on she found herself
trembling violently.

"Well, you're in luck," remarked another member of the chorus. "There
isn't another one of us has got a line."

There was no gainsaying the value of this.  Everybody in the company
realized that she had got a start.  Carrie hugged herself when next
evening the lines got the same applause.  She went home rejoicing,
knowing that soon something must come of it.  It was Hurstwood who, by
his presence, caused her merry thoughts to flee and replaced them with
sharp longings for an end of distress.

The next day she asked him about his venture.

"They're not trying to run any cars except with police.  They don't
want anybody just now--not before next week."

Next week came, but Carrie saw no change.  Hurstwood seemed more
apathetic than ever.  He saw her off mornings to rehearsals and the
like with the utmost calm.  He read and read.  Several times he found
himself staring at an item, but thinking of something else.  The first
of these lapses that he sharply noticed concerned a hilarious party he
had once attended at a driving club, of which he had been a member.  He
sat, gazing downward, and gradually thought he heard the old voices and
the clink of glasses.

"You're a dandy, Hurstwood," his friend Walker said.  He was standing
again well dressed, smiling, good-natured, the recipient of encores for
a good story.

All at once he looked up.  The room was so still it seemed ghostlike.
He heard the clock ticking audibly and half suspected that he had been
dozing.  The paper was so straight in his hands, however, and the items
he had been reading so directly before him, that he rid himself of the
doze idea.  Still, it seemed peculiar.  When it occurred a second time,
however, it did not seem quite so strange.

Butcher and grocery man, baker and coal man--not the group with whom he
was then dealing, but those who had trusted him to the limit--called.
He met them all blandly, becoming deft in excuse. At last he became
bold, pretended to be out, or waved them off.

"They can't get blood out of a turnip," he said.  "if I had it I'd pay
them."

Carrie's little soldier friend, Miss Osborne, seeing her succeeding,
had become a sort of satellite.  Little Osborne could never of herself
amount to anything.  She seemed to realize it in a sort of pussy-like
way and instinctively concluded to cling with her soft little claws to
Carrie.

"Oh, you'll get up," she kept telling Carrie with admiration. "You're
so good."

Timid as Carrie was, she was strong in capability.  The reliance of
others made her feel as if she must, and when she must she dared.
Experience of the world and of necessity was in her favor.  No longer
the lightest word of a man made her head dizzy.  She had learned that
men could change and fail.  Flattery in its most palpable form had lost
its force with her.  It required superiority--kindly superiority--to
move her--the superiority of a genius like Ames.

"I don't like the actors in our company," she told Lola one day.
"They're all so struck on themselves."

"Don't you think Mr. Barclay's pretty nice?" inquired Lola, who had
received a condescending smile or two from that quarter.

"Oh, he's nice enough," answered Carrie; "but he isn't sincere. He
assumes such an air."

Lola felt for her first hold upon Carrie in the following manner:

"Are you paying room-rent where you are?"

"Certainly," answered Carrie.  "Why?"

"I know where I could get the loveliest room and bath, cheap. It's too
big for me, but it would be just right for two, and the rent is only
six dollars a week for both."

"Where?" said Carrie.

"In Seventeenth Street."

"Well, I don't know as I'd care to change," said Carrie, who was
already turning over the three-dollar rate in her mind.  She was
thinking if she had only herself to support this would leave her
seventeen for herself.

Nothing came of this until after the Brooklyn adventure of Hurstwood's
and her success with the speaking part.  Then she began to feel as if
she must be free.  She thought of leaving Hurstwood and thus making him
act for himself, but he had developed such peculiar traits she feared
he might resist any effort to throw him off.  He might hunt her out at
the show and hound her in that way.  She did not wholly believe that he
would, but he might.  This, she knew, would be an embarrassing thing if
he made himself conspicuous in any way.  It troubled her greatly.

Things were precipitated by the offer of a better part.  One of the
actresses playing the part of a modest sweetheart gave notice of
leaving and Carrie was selected.

"How much are you going to get?" asked Miss Osborne, on hearing the
good news.

"I didn't ask him," said Carrie.

"Well, find out.  Goodness, you'll never get anything if you don't ask.
Tell them you must have forty dollars, anyhow."

"Oh, no," said Carrie.

"Certainly!" exclaimed Lola.  "Ask 'em, anyway."

Carrie succumbed to this prompting, waiting, however, until the manager
gave her notice of what clothing she must have to fit the part.

"How much do I get?" she inquired.

"Thirty-five dollars," he replied.

Carrie was too much astonished and delighted to think of mentioning
forty.  She was nearly beside herself, and almost hugged Lola, who
clung to her at the news.

"It isn't as much as you ought to get," said the latter, "especially
when you've got to buy clothes."

Carrie remembered this with a start.  Where to get the money? She had
none laid up for such an emergency.  Rent day was drawing near.

"I'll not do it," she said, remembering her necessity.  "I don't use
the flat.  I'm not going to give up my money this time.  I'll move."

Fitting into this came another appeal from Miss Osborne, more urgent
than ever.

"Come live with me, won't you?" she pleaded.  "We can have the
loveliest room.  It won't cost you hardly anything that way."

"I'd like to," said Carrie, frankly.

"Oh, do," said Lola.  "We'll have such a good time."

Carrie thought a while.

"I believe I will," she said, and then added: "I'll have to see first,
though." With the idea thus grounded, rent day approaching, and clothes
calling for instant purchase, she soon found excuse in Hurstwood's
lassitude.  He said less and drooped more than ever.

As rent day approached, an idea grew in him.  It was fostered by the
demands of creditors and the impossibility of holding up many more.
Twenty-eight dollars was too much for rent.  "It's hard on her," he
thought.  "We could get a cheaper place."

Stirred with this idea, he spoke at the breakfast table.

"Don't you think we pay too much rent here?" he asked.

"Indeed I do," said Carrie, not catching his drift.

"I should think we could get a smaller place," he suggested.  "We don't
need four rooms."

Her countenance, had he been scrutinizing her, would have exhibited the
disturbance she felt at this evidence of his determination to stay by
her.  He saw nothing remarkable in asking her to come down lower.

"Oh, I don't know," she answered, growing wary.

"There must be places around here where we could get a couple of rooms,
which would do just as well."

Her heart revolted.  "Never!" she thought.  Who would furnish the money
to move? To think of being in two rooms with him! She resolved to spend
her money for clothes quickly, before something terrible happened.
That very day she did it.  Having done so, there was but one other
thing to do.

"Lola," she said, visiting her friend, "I think I'll come."

"Oh, jolly!" cried the latter.

"Can we get it right away?" she asked, meaning the room.

"Certainly," cried Lola.

They went to look at it.  Carrie had saved ten dollars from her
expenditures--enough for this and her board beside.  Her enlarged
salary would not begin for ten days yet--would not reach her for
seventeen.  She paid half of the six dollars with her friend.

"Now, I've just enough to get on to the end of the week," she confided.

"Oh, I've got some," said Lola.  "I've got twenty-five dollars, if you
need it."

"No," said Carrie.  "I guess I'll get along."

They decided to move Friday, which was two days away.  Now that the
thing was settled, Carrie's heart misgave her.  She felt very much like
a criminal in the matter.  Each day looking at Hurstwood, she had
realized that, along with the disagreeableness of his attitude, there
was something pathetic.

She looked at him the same evening she had made up her mind to go, and
now he seemed not so shiftless and worthless, but run down and beaten
upon by chance.  His eyes were not keen, his face marked, his hands
flabby.  She thought his hair had a touch of gray.  All unconscious of
his doom, he rocked and read his paper, while she glanced at him.

Knowing that the end was so near, she became rather solicitous.

"Will you go over and get some canned peaches?" she asked Hurstwood,
laying down a two-dollar bill.

"Certainly," he said, looking in wonder at the money.

"See if you can get some nice asparagus," she added.  "I'll cook it for
dinner."

Hurstwood rose and took the money, slipping on his overcoat and getting
his hat.  Carrie noticed that both of these articles of apparel were
old and poor looking in appearance.  It was plain enough before, but
now it came home with peculiar force.  Perhaps he couldn't help it,
after all.  He had done well in Chicago. She remembered his fine
appearance the days he had met her in the park.  Then he was so
sprightly, so clean.  Had it been all his fault?

He came back and laid the change down with the food.

"You'd better keep it," she observed.  "We'll need other things."

"No," he said, with a sort of pride; "you keep it."

"Oh, go on and keep it," she replied, rather unnerved.  "There'll be
other things."

He wondered at this, not knowing the pathetic figure he had become in
her eyes.  She restrained herself with difficulty from showing a quaver
in her voice.

To say truly, this would have been Carrie's attitude in any case. She
had looked back at times upon her parting from Drouet and had regretted
that she had served him so badly.  She hoped she would never meet him
again, but she was ashamed of her conduct.  Not that she had any choice
in the final separation.  She had gone willingly to seek him, with
sympathy in her heart, when Hurstwood had reported him ill.  There was
something cruel somewhere, and not being able to track it mentally to
its logical lair, she concluded with feeling that he would never
understand what Hurstwood had done and would see hard-hearted decision
in her deed; hence her shame.  Not that she cared for him.  She did not
want to make any one who had been good to her feel badly.

She did not realize what she was doing by allowing these feelings to
possess her.  Hurstwood, noticing the kindness, conceived better of
her.  "Carrie's good-natured, anyhow," he thought.

Going to Miss Osborne's that afternoon, she found that little lady
packing and singing.

"Why don't you come over with me today?" she asked.

"Oh, I can't," said Carrie.  "I'll be there Friday.  Would you mind
lending me the twenty-five dollars you spoke of?"

"Why, no," said Lola, going for her purse.

"I want to get some other things," said Carrie.

"Oh, that's all right," answered the little girl, good-naturedly, glad
to be of service. It had been days since Hurstwood had done more than
go to the grocery or to the news-stand.  Now the weariness of indoors
was upon him--had been for two days--but chill, gray weather had held
him back.  Friday broke fair and warm.  It was one of those lovely
harbingers of spring, given as a sign in dreary winter that earth is
not forsaken of warmth and beauty.  The blue heaven, holding its one
golden orb, poured down a crystal wash of warm light.  It was plain,
from the voice of the sparrows, that all was halcyon outside.  Carrie
raised the front windows, and felt the south wind blowing.

"It's lovely out to-day," she remarked.

"Is it?" said Hurstwood.

After breakfast, he immediately got his other clothes.

"Will you be back for lunch?" asked Carrie nervously.

"No," he said.

He went out into the streets and tramped north, along Seventh Avenue,
idly fixing upon the Harlem River as an objective point. He had seen
some ships up there, the time he had called upon the brewers.  He
wondered how the territory thereabouts was growing.

Passing Fifty-ninth Street, he took the west side of Central Park,
which he followed to Seventy-eighth Street.  Then he remembered the
neighborhood and turned over to look at the mass of buildings erected.
It was very much improved.  The great open spaces were filling up.
Coming back, he kept to the Park until 110th Street, and then turned
into Seventh Avenue again, reaching the pretty river by one o'clock.

There it ran winding before his gaze, shining brightly in the clear
light, between the undulating banks on the right and the tall, tree-
covered heights on the left.  The spring-like atmosphere woke him to a
sense of its loveliness, and for a few moments he stood looking at it,
folding his hands behind his back.  Then he turned and followed it
toward the east side, idly seeking the ships he had seen.  It was four
o'clock before the waning day, with its suggestion of a cooler evening,
caused him to return.  He was hungry and would enjoy eating in the warm
room.

When he reached the flat by half-past five, it was still dark. He knew
that Carrie was not there, not only because there was no light showing
through the transom, but because the evening papers were stuck between
the outside knob and the door.  He opened with his key and went in.
Everything was still dark.  Lighting the gas, he sat down, preparing to
wait a little while.  Even if Carrie did come now, dinner would be
late.  He read until six, then got up to fix something for himself.

As he did so, he noticed that the room seemed a little queer. What was
it? He looked around, as if he missed something, and then saw an
envelope near where he had been sitting.  It spoke for itself, almost
without further action on his part.

Reaching over, he took it, a sort of chill settling upon him even while
he reached.  The crackle of the envelope in his hands was loud.  Green
paper money lay soft within the note.

 "Dear George," he read, crunching the money in one hand, "I'm going
away.  I'm not coming back any more.  It's no use trying to keep up the
flat; I can't do it.  I wouldn't mind helping you, if I could, but I
can't support us both, and pay the rent.  I need what little I make to
pay for my clothes.  I'm leaving twenty dollars.  It's all I have just
now.  You can do whatever you like with the furniture.  I won't want
it.--CARRIE.

He dropped the note and looked quietly round.  Now he knew what he
missed.  It was the little ornamental clock, which was hers. It had
gone from the mantelpiece.  He went into the front room, his bedroom,
the parlor, lighting the gas as he went.  From the chiffonier had gone
the knick-knacks of silver and plate.  From the table-top, the lace
coverings.  He opened the wardrobe--no clothes of hers.  He opened the
drawers--nothing of hers.  Her trunk was gone from its accustomed
place.  Back in his own room hung his old clothes, just as he had left
them.  Nothing else was gone.

He stepped into the parlor and stood for a few moments looking vacantly
at the floor.  The silence grew oppressive.  The little flat seemed
wonderfully deserted.  He wholly forgot that he was hungry, that it was
only dinner-time.  It seemed later in the night.

Suddenly, he found that the money was still in his hands.  There were
twenty dollars in all, as she had said.  Now he walked back, leaving
the lights ablaze, and feeling as if the flat were empty.

"I'll get out of this," he said to himself.

Then the sheer loneliness of his situation rushed upon him in full.

"Left me!" he muttered, and repeated, "left me!"

The place that had been so comfortable, where he had spent so many days
of warmth, was now a memory.  Something colder and chillier confronted
him.  He sank down in his chair, resting his chin in his hand--mere
sensation, without thought, holding him.

Then something like a bereaved affection and self-pity swept over him.

"She needn't have gone away," he said.  "I'd have got something."

He sat a long while without rocking, and added quite clearly, out loud:

"I tried, didn't I?"

At midnight he was still rocking, staring at the floor.




Chapter XLIII
THE WORLD TURNS FLATTERER--AN EYE IN THE DARK

 Installed in her comfortable room, Carrie wondered how Hurstwood had
taken her departure.  She arranged a few things hastily and then left
for the theatre, half expecting to encounter him at the door.  Not
finding him, her dread lifted, and she felt more kindly toward him.
She quite forgot him until about to come out, after the show, when the
chance of his being there frightened her.  As day after day passed and
she heard nothing at all, the thought of being bothered by him passed.
In a little while she was, except for occasional thoughts, wholly free
of the gloom with which her life had been weighed in the flat.

It is curious to note how quickly a profession absorbs one. Carrie
became wise in theatrical lore, hearing the gossip of little Lola.  She
learned what the theatrical papers were, which ones published items
about actresses and the like.  She began to read the newspaper notices,
not only of the opera in which she had so small a part, but of others.
Gradually the desire for notice took hold of her.  She longed to be
renowned like others, and read with avidity all the complimentary or
critical comments made concerning others high in her profession.  The
showy world in which her interest lay completely absorbed her.

It was about this time that the newspapers and magazines were beginning
to pay that illustrative attention to the beauties of the stage which
has since become fervid.  The newspapers, and particularly the Sunday
newspapers, indulged in large decorative theatrical pages, in which the
faces and forms of well-known theatrical celebrities appeared, enclosed
with artistic scrolls. The magazines also or at least one or two of the
newer ones-published occasional portraits of pretty stars, and now and
again photos of scenes from various plays.  Carrie watched these with
growing interest.  When would a scene from her opera appear? When would
some paper think her photo worth while?

The Sunday before taking her new part she scanned the theatrical pages
for some little notice.  It would have accorded with her expectations
if nothing had been said, but there in the squibs, tailing off several
more substantial items, was a wee notice. Carrie read it with a
tingling body:

 "The part of Katisha, the country maid, in 'The Wives of Abdul' at the
Broadway, heretofore played by Inez Carew, will be hereafter filled by
Carrie Madenda, one of the cleverest members of the chorus."

 Carrie hugged herself with delight.  Oh, wasn't it just fine! At last!
The first, the long-hoped for, the delightful notice! And they called
her clever.  She could hardly restrain herself from laughing loudly.
Had Lola seen it?

"They've got a notice here of the part I'm going to play tomorrow
night," said Carrie to her friend.

"Oh, jolly! Have they?" cried Lola, running to her.  "That's all
right," she said, looking.  "You'll get more now, if you do well. I had
my picture in the 'World' once."

"Did you?" asked Carrie.

"Did I? Well, I should say," returned the little girl.  "They had a
frame around it."

Carrie laughed.

"They've never published my picture."

"But they will," said Lola.  "You'll see.  You do better than most that
get theirs in now."

Carrie felt deeply grateful for this.  She almost loved Lola for the
sympathy and praise she extended.  It was so helpful to her-so almost
necessary.

Fulfilling her part capably brought another notice in the papers that
she was doing her work acceptably.  This pleased her immensely.  She
began to think the world was taking note of her.

The first week she got her thirty-five dollars, it seemed an enormous
sum.  Paying only three dollars for room rent seemed ridiculous.  After
giving Lola her twenty-five, she still had seven dollars left.  With
four left over from previous earnings, she had eleven.  Five of this
went to pay the regular installment on the clothes she had to buy.  The
next week she was even in greater feather.  Now, only three dollars
need be paid for room rent and five on her clothes.  The rest she had
for food and her own whims.

"You'd better save a little for summer," cautioned Lola.  "We'll
probably close in May."

"I intend to," said Carrie.

The regular entrance of thirty-five dollars a week to one who has
endured scant allowances for several years is a demoralizing thing.
Carrie found her purse bursting with good green bills of comfortable
denominations.  Having no one dependent upon her, she began to buy
pretty clothes and pleasing trinkets, to eat well, and to ornament her
room.  Friends were not long in gathering about.  She met a few young
men who belonged to Lola's staff. The members of the opera company made
her acquaintance without the formality of introduction.  One of these
discovered a fancy for her.  On several occasions he strolled home with
her.

"Let's stop in and have a rarebit," he suggested one midnight.

"Very well," said Carrie.

In the rosy restaurant, filled with the merry lovers of late hours, she
found herself criticizing this man.  He was too stilted, too self-
opinionated.  He did not talk of anything that lifted her above the
common run of clothes and material success. When it was all over, he
smiled most graciously.

"Got to go straight home, have you?" he said.

"Yes," she answered, with an air of quiet understanding.

"She's not so inexperienced as she looks," he thought, and thereafter
his respect and ardor were increased.

She could not help sharing in Lola's love for a good time.  There were
days when they went carriage riding, nights when after the show they
dined, afternoons when they strolled along Broadway, tastefully
dressed.  She was getting in the metropolitan whirl of pleasure.

At last her picture appeared in one of the weeklies.  She had not known
of it, and it took her breath.  "Miss Carrie Madenda," it was labeled.
"One of the favorites of 'The Wives of Abdul' company." At Lola's
advice she had had some pictures taken by Sarony.  They had got one
there.  She thought of going down and buying a few copies of the paper,
but remembered that there was no one she knew well enough to send them
to.  Only Lola, apparently, in all the world was interested.

The metropolis is a cold place socially, and Carrie soon found that a
little money brought her nothing.  The world of wealth and distinction
was quite as far away as ever.  She could feel that there was no warm,
sympathetic friendship back of the easy merriment with which many
approached her.  All seemed to be seeking their own amusement,
regardless of the possible sad consequence to others.  So much for the
lessons of Hurstwood and Drouet.

In April she learned that the opera would probably last until the
middle or the end of May, according to the size of the audiences. Next
season it would go on the road.  She wondered if she would be with it.
As usual, Miss Osborne, owing to her moderate salary, was for securing
a home engagement.

"They're putting on a summer play at the Casino," she announced, after
figuratively putting her ear to the ground.  "Let's try and get in
that."

"I'm willing," said Carrie.

They tried in time and were apprised of the proper date to apply again.
That was May 16th.  Meanwhile their own show closed May 5th.

"Those that want to go with the show next season," said the manager,
"will have to sign this week."

"Don't you sign," advised Lola.  "I wouldn't go."

"I know," said Carrie, "but maybe I can't get anything else."

"Well, I won't," said the little girl, who had a resource in her
admirers.  "I went once and I didn't have anything at the end of the
season."

Carrie thought this over.  She had never been on the road.

"We can get along," added Lola.  "I always have."

Carrie did not sign.

The manager who was putting on the summer skit at the Casino had never
heard of Carrie, but the several notices she had received, her
published picture, and the program bearing her name had some little
weight with him.  He gave her a silent part at thirty dollars a week.

"Didn't I tell you?" said Lola.  "It doesn't do you any good to go away
from New York.  They forget all about you if you do."

Now, because Carrie was pretty, the gentlemen who made up the advance
illustrations of shows about to appear for the Sunday papers selected
Carrie's photo along with others to illustrate the announcement.
Because she was very pretty, they gave it excellent space and drew
scrolls about it.  Carrie was delighted. Still, the management did not
seem to have seen anything of it. At least, no more attention was paid
to her than before.  At the same time there seemed very little in her
part.  It consisted of standing around in all sorts of scenes, a silent
little Quakeress.  The author of the skit had fancied that a great deal
could be made of such a part, given to the right actress, but now,
since it had been doled out to Carrie, he would as leave have had it
cut out.

"Don't kick, old man," remarked the manager.  "If it don't go the first
week we will cut it out."

Carrie had no warning of this halcyon intention.  She practiced her
part ruefully, feeling that she was effectually shelved.  At the dress
rehearsal she was disconsolate.

"That isn't so bad," said the author, the manager noting the curious
effect which Carrie's blues had upon the part.  "Tell her to frown a
little more when Sparks dances."

Carrie did not know it, but there was the least show of wrinkles
between her eyes and her mouth was puckered quaintly.

"Frown a little more, Miss Madenda," said the stage manager.

Carrie instantly brightened up, thinking he had meant it as a rebuke.

"No; frown," he said.  "Frown as you did before."

Carrie looked at him in astonishment.

"I mean it," he said.  "Frown hard when Mr. Sparks dances.  I want to
see how it looks."

It was easy enough to do.  Carrie scowled.  The effect was something so
quaint and droll it caught even the manager.

"That is good," he said.  "If she'll do that all through, I think it
will take."

Going over to Carrie, he said:

"Suppose you try frowning all through.  Do it hard.  Look mad. It'll
make the part really funny."

On the opening night it looked to Carrie as if there were nothing to
her part, after all.  The happy, sweltering audience did not seem to
see her in the first act.  She frowned and frowned, but to no effect.
Eyes were riveted upon the more elaborate efforts of the stars.

In the second act, the crowd, wearied by a dull conversation, roved
with its eyes about the stage and sighted her.  There she was, suited-
suited, sweet-faced, demure, but scowling.  At first the general idea
was that she was temporarily irritated, that the look was genuine and
not fun at all.  As she went on frowning, looking now at one principal
and now at the other, the audience began to smile.  The portly
gentlemen in the front rows began to feel that she was a delicious
little morsel.  It was the kind of frown they would have loved to force
away with kisses.  All the gentlemen yearned toward her.  She was
capital.

At last, the chief comedian, singing in the center of the stage,
noticed a giggle where it was not expected.  Then another and another.
When the place came for loud applause it was only moderate.  What could
be the trouble? He realized that something was up.

All at once, after an exit, he caught sight of Carrie.  She was
frowning alone on the stage and the audience was giggling and laughing.

"By George, I won't stand that!" thought the thespian.  "I'm not going
to have my work cut up by some one else.  Either she quits that when I
do my turn or I quit."

"Why, that's all right," said the manager, when the kick came. "That's
what she's supposed to do.  You needn't pay any attention to that."

"But she ruins my work."

"No, she don't," returned the former, soothingly.  "It's only a little
fun on the side."

"It is, eh?" exclaimed the big comedian.  "She killed my hand all
right.  I'm not going to stand that."

"Well, wait until after the show.  Wait until to-morrow.  We'll see
what we can do."

The next act, however, settled what was to be done.  Carrie was the
chief feature of the play.  The audience, the more it studied her, the
more it indicated its delight.  Every other feature paled beside the
quaint, teasing, delightful atmosphere which Carrie contributed while
on the stage.  Manager and company realized she had made a hit.

The critics of the daily papers completed her triumph.  There were long
notices in praise of the quality of the burlesque, touched with
recurrent references to Carrie.  The contagious mirth of the thing was
repeatedly emphasized.

 "Miss Madenda presents one of the most delightful bits of character
work ever seen on the Casino stage," observed the stage critic of the
"Sun."  "It is a bit of quiet, unassuming drollery which warms like
good wine.  Evidently the part was not intended to take precedence, as
Miss Madenda is not often on the stage, but the audience, with the
characteristic perversity of such bodies, selected for itself.  The
little Quakeress was marked for a favorite the moment she appeared, and
thereafter easily held attention and applause.  The vagaries of fortune
are indeed curious."

 The critic of the "Evening World," seeking as usual to establish a
catch phrase which should "go" with the town, wound up by advising: "If
you wish to be merry, see Carrie frown."

The result was miraculous so far as Carrie's fortune was concerned.
Even during the morning she received a congratulatory message from the
manager.

"You seem to have taken the town by storm," he wrote.  "This is
delightful.  I am as glad for your sake as for my own."

The author also sent word.

That evening when she entered the theatre the manager had a most
pleasant greeting for her.

"Mr. Stevens," he said, referring to the author, "is preparing a little
song, which he would like you to sing next week."

"Oh, I can't sing," returned Carrie.

"It isn't anything difficult.  'It's something that is very simple,' he
says, 'and would suit you exactly.'"

"Of course, I wouldn't mind trying," said Carrie, archly.

"Would you mind coming to the box-office a few moments before you
dress?" observed the manager, in addition.  "There's a little matter I
want to speak to you about."

"Certainly," replied Carrie.

In that latter place the manager produced a paper.

"Now, of course," he said, "we want to be fair with you in the matter
of salary.  Your contract here only calls for thirty dollars a week for
the next three months.  How would it do to make it, say, one hundred
and fifty a week and extend it for twelve months?"

"Oh, very well," said Carrie, scarcely believing her ears.

"Supposing, then, you just sign this."

Carrie looked and beheld a new contract made out like the other one,
with the exception of the new figures of salary and time. With a hand
trembling from excitement she affixed her name.

"One hundred and fifty a week!" she murmured, when she was again alone.
She found, after all--as what millionaire has not?--that there was no
realizing, in consciousness, the meaning of large sums.  It was only a
shimmering, glittering phrase in which lay a world of possibilities.

Down in a third-rate Bleecker Street hotel, the brooding Hurstwood read
the dramatic item covering Carrie's success, without at first realizing
who was meant.  Then suddenly it came to him and he read the whole
thing over again.

"That's her, all right, I guess," he said.

Then he looked about upon a dingy, moth-eaten hotel lobby.

"I guess she's struck it," he thought, a picture of the old shiny,
plush-covered world coming back, with its lights, its ornaments, its
carriages, and flowers.  Ah, she was in the walled city now! Its
splendid gates had opened, admitting her from a cold, dreary outside.
She seemed a creature afar off--like every other celebrity he had
known.

"Well, let her have it," he said.  "I won't bother her."

It was the grim resolution of a bent, bedraggled, but unbroken pride.




Chapter XLIV
AND THIS IS NOT ELF LAND--WHAT GOLD WILL NOT BUY

 When Carrie got back on the stage, she found that over night her
dressing-room had been changed.

"You are to use this room, Miss Madenda," said one of the stage
lackeys.

No longer any need of climbing several flights of steps to a small coop
shared with another.  Instead, a comparatively large and commodious
chamber with conveniences not enjoyed by the small fry overhead.  She
breathed deeply and with delight.  Her sensations were more physical
than mental.  In fact, she was scarcely thinking at all.  Heart and
body were having their say.

Gradually the deference and congratulation gave her a mental
appreciation of her state.  She was no longer ordered, but requested,
and that politely.  The other members of the cast looked at her
enviously as she came out arrayed in her simple habit, which she wore
all through the play.  All those who had supposedly been her equals and
superiors now smiled the smile of sociability, as much as to say: "How
friendly we have always been." Only the star comedian whose part had
been so deeply injured stalked by himself.  Figuratively, he could not
kiss the hand that smote him.

Doing her simple part, Carrie gradually realized the meaning of the
applause which was for her, and it was sweet.  She felt mildly guilty
of something--perhaps unworthiness.  When her associates addressed her
in the wings she only smiled weakly. The pride and daring of place were
not for her.  It never once crossed her mind to be reserved or haughty-
-to be other than she had been.  After the performances she rode to her
room with Lola, in a carriage provided.

Then came a week in which the first fruits of success were offered to
her lips--bowl after bowl.  It did not matter that her splendid salary
had not begun.  The world seemed satisfied with the promise.  She began
to get letters and cards.  A Mr. Withers-whom she did not know from
Adam--having learned by some hook or crook where she resided, bowed
himself politely in.

"You will excuse me for intruding," he said; "but have you been
thinking of changing your apartments?"

"I hadn't thought of it," returned Carrie.

"Well, I am connected with the Wellington--the new hotel on Broadway.
You have probably seen notices of it in the papers."

Carrie recognized the name as standing for one of the newest and most
imposing hostelries.  She had heard it spoken of as having a splendid
restaurant.

"Just so," went on Mr. Withers, accepting her acknowledgment of
familiarity.  "We have some very elegant rooms at present which we
would like to have you look at, if you have not made up your mind where
you intend to reside for the summer.  Our apartments are perfect in
every detail--hot and cold water, private baths, special hall service
for every floor, elevators, and all that. You know what our restaurant
is."

Carrie looked at him quietly.  She was wondering whether he took her to
be a millionaire.

"What are your rates?" she inquired.

"Well, now, that is what I came to talk with you privately about. Our
regular rates are anywhere from three to fifty dollars a day."

"Mercy!" interrupted Carrie.  "I couldn't pay any such rate as that."

"I know how you feel about it," exclaimed Mr. Withers, halting. "But
just let me explain.  I said those are our regular rates. Like every
other hotel we make special ones however.  Possibly you have not
thought about it, but your name is worth something to us." "Oh!"
ejaculated Carrie, seeing at a glance.

"Of course.  Every hotel depends upon the repute of its patrons. A
well-known actress like yourself," and he bowed politely, while Carrie
flushed, "draws attention to the hotel, and--although you may not
believe it--patrons."

"Oh, yes," returned Carrie, vacantly, trying to arrange this curious
proposition in her mind.

"Now," continued Mr. Withers, swaying his derby hat softly and beating
one of his polished shoes upon the floor, "I want to arrange, if
possible, to have you come and stop at the Wellington.  You need not
trouble about terms.  In fact, we need hardly discuss them.  Anything
will do for the summer--a mere figure--anything that you think you
could afford to pay."

Carrie was about to interrupt, but he gave her no chance.

"You can come to-day or to-morrow--the earlier the better--and we will
give you your choice of nice, light, outside rooms--the very best we
have."

"You're very kind," said Carrie, touched by the agent's extreme
affability.  "I should like to come very much.  I would want to pay
what is right, however.  I shouldn't want to----"

"You need not trouble about that at all," interrupted Mr. Withers.  "We
can arrange that to your entire satisfaction at any time.  If three
dollars a day is satisfactory to you, it will be so to us.  All you
have to do is to pay that sum to the clerk at the end of the week or
month, just as you wish, and he will give you a receipt for what the
rooms would cost if charged for at our regular rates."

The speaker paused.

"Suppose you come and look at the rooms," he added.

"I'd be glad to," said Carrie, "but I have a rehearsal this morning."

"I did not mean at once," he returned.  "Any time will do.  Would this
afternoon be inconvenient?"

"Not at all," said Carrie.

Suddenly she remembered Lola, who was out at the time.

"I have a room-mate," she added, "who will have to go wherever I do.  I
forgot about that."

"Oh, very well," said Mr. Withers, blandly.  "It is for you to say whom
you want with you.  As I say, all that can be arranged to suit
yourself."

He bowed and backed toward the door.

"At four, then, we may expect you?"

"Yes," said Carrie.

"I will be there to show you," and so Mr. Withers withdrew.

After rehearsal Carrie informed Lola. "Did they really?" exclaimed the
latter, thinking of the Wellington as a group of managers.  "Isn't that
fine? Oh, jolly! It's so swell.  That's where we dined that night we
went with those two Cushing boys.  Don't you know?"

"I remember," said Carrie.

"Oh, it's as fine as it can be."

"We'd better be going up there," observed Carrie later in the
afternoon.

The rooms which Mr. Withers displayed to Carrie and Lola were three and
bath--a suite on the parlor floor.  They were done in chocolate and
dark red, with rugs and hangings to match.  Three windows looked down
into busy Broadway on the east, three into a side street which crossed
there.  There were two lovely bedrooms, set with brass and white enamel
beds, white ribbon-trimmed chairs and chiffoniers to match.  In the
third room, or parlor, was a piano, a heavy piano lamp, with a shade of
gorgeous pattern, a library table, several huge easy rockers, some dado
book shelves, and a gilt curio case, filled with oddities.  Pictures
were upon the walls, soft Turkish pillows upon the divan footstools of
brown plush upon the floor.  Such accommodations would ordinarily cost
a hundred dollars a week.

"Oh, lovely!" exclaimed Lola, walking about.

"It is comfortable," said Carrie, who was lifting a lace curtain and
looking down into crowded Broadway.

The bath was a handsome affair, done in white enamel, with a large,
blue-bordered stone tub and nickel trimmings.  It was bright and
commodious, with a beveled mirror set in the wall at one end and
incandescent lights arranged in three places.

"Do you find these satisfactory?" observed Mr. Withers.

"Oh, very," answered Carrie.

"Well, then, any time you find it convenient to move in, they are
ready.  The boy will bring you the keys at the door."

Carrie noted the elegantly carpeted and decorated hall, the marbled
lobby, and showy waiting-room.  It was such a place as she had often
dreamed of occupying.

"I guess we'd better move right away, don't you think so?" she observed
to Lola, thinking of the commonplace chamber in Seventeenth Street.

"Oh, by all means," said the latter.

The next day her trunks left for the new abode.

Dressing, after the matinee on Wednesday, a knock came at her dressing-
room door.

Carrie looked at the card handed by the boy and suffered a shock of
surprise.

"Tell her I'll be right out," she said softly.  Then, looking at the
card, added: "Mrs. Vance."

"Why, you little sinner," the latter exclaimed, as she saw Carrie
coming toward her across the now vacant stage.  "How in the world did
this happen?"

Carrie laughed merrily.  There was no trace of embarrassment in her
friend's manner.  You would have thought that the long separation had
come about accidentally.

"I don't know," returned Carrie, warming, in spite of her first
troubled feelings, toward this handsome, good-natured young matron.

"Well, you know, I saw your picture in the Sunday paper, but your name
threw me off.  I thought it must be you or somebody that looked just
like you, and I said: 'Well, now, I will go right down there and see.'
I was never more surprised in my life.  How are you, anyway?"

"Oh, very well," returned Carrie.  "How have you been?"

"Fine.  But aren't you a success! Dear, oh! All the papers talking
about you.  I should think you would be just too proud to breathe.  I
was almost afraid to come back here this afternoon."

"Oh, nonsense," said Carrie, blushing.  "You know I'd be glad to see
you."

"Well, anyhow, here you are.  Can't you come up and take dinner with me
now? Where are you stopping?"

"At the Wellington," said Carrie, who permitted herself a touch of
pride in the acknowledgment.

"Oh, are you?" exclaimed the other, upon whom the name was not without
its proper effect.

Tactfully, Mrs. Vance avoided the subject of Hurstwood, of whom she
could not help thinking.  No doubt Carrie had left him.  That much she
surmised.

"Oh, I don't think I can," said Carrie, "to-night.  I have so little
time.  I must be back here by 7.30.  Won't you come and dine with me?"

"I'd be delighted, but I can't to-night," said Mrs. Vance studying
Carrie's fine appearance.  The latter's good fortune made her seem more
than ever worthy and delightful in the others eyes.  "I promised
faithfully to be home at six." Glancing at the small gold watch pinned
to her bosom, she added: "I must be going, too.  Tell me when you're
coming up, if at all."

"Why, any time you like," said Carrie.

"Well, to-morrow then.  I'm living at the Chelsea now."

"Moved again?" exclaimed Carrie, laughing.

"Yes.  You know I can't stay six months in one place.  I just have to
move.  Remember now--half-past five."

"I won't forget," said Carrie, casting a glance at her as she went
away.  Then it came to her that she was as good as this woman now--
perhaps better.  Something in the other's solicitude and interest made
her feel as if she were the one to condescend.

Now, as on each preceding day, letters were handed her by the doorman
at the Casino.  This was a feature which had rapidly developed since
Monday.  What they contained she well knew.  MASH NOTES were old
affairs in their mildest form.  She remembered having received her
first one far back in Columbia City.  Since then, as a chorus girl, she
had received others--gentlemen who prayed for an engagement.  They were
common sport between her and Lola, who received some also.  They both
frequently made light of them.

Now, however, they came thick and fast.  Gentlemen with fortunes did
not hesitate to note, as an addition to their own amiable collection of
virtues, that they had their horses and carriages. Thus one:

 "I have a million in my own right.  I could give you every luxury.
There isn't anything you could ask for that you couldn't have.  I say
this, not because I want to speak of my money, but because I love you
and wish to gratify your every desire.  It is love that prompts me to
write.  Will you not give me one half hour in which to plead my cause?"

 Such of these letters as came while Carrie was still in the
Seventeenth Street place were read with more interest--though never
delight--than those which arrived after she was installed in her
luxurious quarters at the Wellington.  Even there her vanity--or that
self-appreciation which, in its more rabid form, is called vanity--was
not sufficiently cloyed to make these things wearisome.  Adulation,
being new in any form, pleased her. Only she was sufficiently wise to
distinguish between her old condition and her new one.  She had not had
fame or money before. Now they had come.  She had not had adulation and
affectionate propositions before.  Now they had come.  Wherefore? She
smiled to think that men should suddenly find her so much more
attractive.  In the least way it incited her to coolness and
indifference.

"Do look here," she remarked to Lola.  "See what this man says: 'If you
will only deign to grant me one half-hour,'" she repeated, with an
imitation of languor.  "The idea.  Aren't men silly?"

"He must have lots of money, the way he talks," observed Lola. "That's
what they all say," said Carrie, innocently.

"Why don't you see him," suggested Lola, "and hear what he has to say?"

"Indeed I won't," said Carrie.  "I know what he'd say.  I don't want to
meet anybody that way."

Lola looked at her with big, merry eyes.

"He couldn't hurt you," she returned.  "You might have some fun with
him."

Carrie shook her head.

"You're awfully queer," returned the little, blue-eyed soldier.

Thus crowded fortune.  For this whole week, though her large salary had
not yet arrived, it was as if the world understood and trusted her.
Without money--or the requisite sum, at least--she enjoyed the luxuries
which money could buy.  For her the doors of fine places seemed to open
quite without the asking.  These palatial chambers, how marvelously
they came to her.  The elegant apartments of Mrs. Vance in the Chelsea-
-these were hers. Men sent flowers, love notes, offers of fortune.  And
still her dreams ran riot.  The one hundred and fifty! the one hundred
and fifty! What a door to an Aladdin's cave it seemed to be.  Each day,
her head almost turned by developments, her fancies of what her fortune
must be, with ample money, grew and multiplied.  She conceived of
delights which were not--saw lights of joy that never were on land or
sea.  Then, at last, after a world of anticipation, came her first
installment of one hundred and fifty dollars.

It was paid to her in greenbacks--three twenties, six tens, and six
fives.  Thus collected it made a very convenient roll.  It was
accompanied by a smile and a salutation from the cashier who paid it.

"Ah, yes," said the latter, when she applied; "Miss Madenda--one
hundred and fifty dollars.  Quite a success the show seems to have
made."

"Yes, indeed," returned Carrie.

Right after came one of the insignificant members of the company, and
she heard the changed tone of address.

"How much?" said the same cashier, sharply.  One, such as she had only
recently been, was waiting for her modest salary.  It took her back to
the few weeks in which she had collected--or rather had received--
almost with the air of a domestic, four-fifty per week from a lordly
foreman in a shoe factory--a man who, in distributing the envelopes,
had the manner of a prince doling out favors to a servile group of
petitioners.  She knew that out in Chicago this very day the same
factory chamber was full of poor homely-clad girls working in long
lines at clattering machines; that at noon they would eat a miserable
lunch in a half-hour; that Saturday they would gather, as they had when
she was one of them, and accept the small pay for work a hundred times
harder than she was now doing.  Oh, it was so easy now! The world was
so rosy and bright.  She felt so thrilled that she must needs walk back
to the hotel to think, wondering what she should do.

It does not take money long to make plain its impotence, providing the
desires are in the realm of affection.  With her one hundred and fifty
in hand, Carrie could think of nothing particularly to do.  In itself,
as a tangible, apparent thing which she could touch and look upon, it
was a diverting thing for a few days, but this soon passed.  Her hotel
bill did not require its use.  Her clothes had for some time been
wholly satisfactory. Another day or two and she would receive another
hundred and fifty.  It began to appear as if this were not so
startlingly necessary to maintain her present state.  If she wanted to
do anything better or move higher she must have more--a great deal
more.

Now a critic called to get up one of those tinsel interviews which
shine with clever observations, show up the wit of critics, display the
folly of celebrities, and divert the public.  He liked Carrie, and said
so, publicly--adding, however, that she was merely pretty, good-
natured, and lucky.  This cut like a knife.  The "Herald," getting up
an entertainment for the benefit of its free ice fund, did her the
honor to beg her to appear along with celebrities for nothing.  She was
visited by a young author, who had a play which he thought she could
produce.  Alas, she could not judge.  It hurt her to think it.  Then
she found she must put her money in the bank for safety, and so moving,
finally reached the place where it struck her that the door to life's
perfect enjoyment was not open.

Gradually she began to think it was because it was summer. Nothing was
going on much save such entertainments as the one in which she was the
star.  Fifth Avenue was boarded up where the rich had deserted their
mansions.  Madison Avenue was little better.  Broadway was full of
loafing thespians in search of next season's engagements.  The whole
city was quiet and her nights were taken up with her work.  Hence the
feeling that there was little to do.

"I don't know," she said to Lola one day, sitting at one of the windows
which looked down into Broadway, "I get lonely; don't you?"

"No," said Lola, "not very often.  You won't go anywhere.  That's
what's the matter with you."

"Where can I go?"

"Why, there're lots of places," returned Lola, who was thinking of her
own lightsome tourneys with the gay youths.  "You won't go with
anybody."

"I don't want to go with these people who write to me.  I know what
kind they are."

"You oughtn't to be lonely," said Lola, thinking of Carrie's success.
"There're lots would give their ears to be in your shoes."

Carrie looked out again at the passing crowd.

"I don't know," she said.

Unconsciously her idle hands were beginning to weary.




Chapter XLV
CURIOUS SHIFTS OF THE POOR

 The gloomy Hurstwood, sitting in his cheap hotel, where he had taken
refuge with seventy dollars--the price of his furniture-between him and
nothing, saw a hot summer out and a cool fall in, reading.  He was not
wholly indifferent to the fact that his money was slipping away.  As
fifty cents after fifty cents were paid out for a day's lodging he
became uneasy, and finally took a cheaper room--thirty-five cents a
day--to make his money last longer.  Frequently he saw notices of
Carrie.  Her picture was in the "World" once or twice, and an old
"Herald" he found in a chair informed him that she had recently
appeared with some others at a benefit for something or other.  He read
these things with mingled feelings.  Each one seemed to put her farther
and farther away into a realm which became more imposing as it receded
from him.  On the billboards, too, he saw a pretty poster, showing her
as the Quaker Maid, demure and dainty.  More than once he stopped and
looked at these, gazing at the pretty face in a sullen sort of way.
His clothes were shabby, and he presented a marked contrast to all that
she now seemed to be.

Somehow, so long as he knew she was at the Casino, though he had never
any intention of going near her, there was a subconscious comfort for
him--he was not quite alone.  The show seemed such a fixture that,
after a month or two, he began to take it for granted that it was still
running.  In September it went on the road and he did not notice it.
When all but twenty dollars of his money was gone, he moved to a
fifteen-cent lodging-house in the Bowery, where there was a bare
lounging-room filled with tables and benches as well as some chairs.
Here his preference was to close his eyes and dream of other days, a
habit which grew upon him.  It was not sleep at first, but a mental
hearkening back to scenes and incidents in his Chicago life.  As the
present became darker, the past grew brighter, and all that concerned
it stood in relief.

He was unconscious of just how much this habit had hold of him until
one day he found his lips repeating an old answer he had made to one of
his friends.  They were in Fitzgerald and Moy's. It was as if he stood
in the door of his elegant little office, comfortably dressed, talking
to Sagar Morrison about the value of South Chicago real estate in which
the latter was about to invest.

"How would you like to come in on that with me?" he heard Morrison say.

"Not me," he answered, just as he had years before.  "I have my hands
full now."

The movement of his lips aroused him.  He wondered whether he had
really spoken.  The next time he noticed anything of the sort he really
did talk.

"Why don't you jump, you bloody fool?" he was saying.  "Jump!"

It was a funny English story he was telling to a company of actors.
Even as his voice recalled him, he was smiling.  A crusty old codger,
sitting near by, seemed disturbed; at least, he stared in a most
pointed way.  Hurstwood straightened up.  The humor of the memory fled
in an instant and he felt ashamed.  For relief, he left his chair and
strolled out into the streets.

One day, looking down the ad. columns of the "Evening World," he saw
where a new play was at the Casino.  Instantly, he came to a mental
halt.  Carrie had gone! He remembered seeing a poster of her only
yesterday, but no doubt it was one left uncovered by the new signs.
Curiously, this fact shook him up.  He had almost to admit that somehow
he was depending upon her being in the city. Now she was gone.  He
wondered how this important fact had skipped him.  Goodness knows when
she would be back now. Impelled by a nervous fear, he rose and went
into the dingy hall, where he counted his remaining money, unseen.
There were but ten dollars in all.

He wondered how all these other lodging-house people around him got
along.  They didn't seem to do anything.  Perhaps they begged--
unquestionably they did.  Many was the dime he had given to such as
they in his day.  He had seen other men asking for money on the
streets.  Maybe he could get some that way.  There was horror in this
thought.

Sitting in the lodging-house room, he came to his last fifty cents.  He
had saved and counted until his health was affected. His stoutness had
gone.  With it, even the semblance of a fit in his clothes.  Now he
decided he must do something, and, walking about, saw another day go
by, bringing him down to his last twenty cents--not enough to eat for
the morrow.

Summoning all his courage, he crossed to Broadway and up to the
Broadway Central hotel.  Within a block he halted, undecided.  A big,
heavy-faced porter was standing at one of the side entrances, looking
out.  Hurstwood purposed to appeal to him. Walking straight up, he was
upon him before he could turn away.

"My friend," he said, recognizing even in his plight the man's
inferiority, "is there anything about this hotel that I could get to
do?"

The porter stared at him the while he continued to talk.

"I'm out of work and out of money and I've got to get something,-it
doesn't matter what.  I don't care to talk about what I've been, but if
you'd tell me how to get something to do, I'd be much obliged to you.
It wouldn't matter if it only lasted a few days just now.  I've got to
have something."

The porter still gazed, trying to look indifferent.  Then, seeing that
Hurstwood was about to go on, he said:

"I've nothing to do with it.  You'll have to ask inside."

Curiously, this stirred Hurstwood to further effort.

"I thought you might tell me."

The fellow shook his head irritably.

Inside went the ex-manager and straight to an office off the clerk's
desk.  One of the managers of the hotel happened to be there.
Hurstwood looked him straight in the eye.

"Could you give me something to do for a few days?" he said. "I'm in a
position where I have to get something at once."

The comfortable manager looked at him, as much as to say: "Well, I
should judge so."

"I came here," explained Hurstwood, nervously, "because I've been a
manager myself in my day.  I've had bad luck in a way but I'm not here
to tell you that.  I want something to do, if only for a week."

The man imagined he saw a feverish gleam in the applicant's eye.

"What hotel did you manage?" he inquired.

"It wasn't a hotel," said Hurstwood.  "I was manager of Fitzgerald and
Moy's place in Chicago for fifteen years."

"Is that so?" said the hotel man.  "How did you come to get out of
that?"

The figure of Hurstwood was rather surprising in contrast to the fact.

"Well, by foolishness of my own.  It isn't anything to talk about now.
You could find out if you wanted to.  I'm 'broke' now and, if you will
believe me, I haven't eaten anything to-day."

The hotel man was slightly interested in this story.  He could hardly
tell what to do with such a figure, and yet Hurstwood's earnestness
made him wish to do something.

"Call Olsen," he said, turning to the clerk.

In reply to a bell and a disappearing hall-boy, Olsen, the head porter,
appeared.

"Olsen," said the manager, "is there anything downstairs you could find
for this man to do? I'd like to give him something."

"I don't know, sir," said Olsen.  "We have about all the help we need.
I think I could find something, sir, though, if you like."

"Do.  Take him to the kitchen and tell Wilson to give him something to
eat."

"All right, sir," said Olsen.

Hurstwood followed.  Out of the manager's sight, the head porter's
manner changed.

"I don't know what the devil there is to do," he observed.

Hurstwood said nothing.  To him the big trunk hustler was a subject for
private contempt.

"You're to give this man something to eat," he observed to the cook.

The latter looked Hurstwood over, and seeing something keen and
intellectual in his eyes, said:

"Well, sit down over there."

Thus was Hurstwood installed in the Broadway Central, but not for long.
He was in no shape or mood to do the scrub work that exists about the
foundation of every hotel.  Nothing better offering, he was set to aid
the fireman, to work about the basement, to do anything and everything
that might offer. Porters, cooks, firemen, clerks--all were over him.
Moreover his appearance did not please these individuals--his temper
was too lonely--and they made it disagreeable for him.

With the stolidity and indifference of despair, however, he endured it
all, sleeping in an attic at the roof of the house, eating what the
cook gave him, accepting a few dollars a week, which he tried to save.
His constitution was in no shape to endure.

One day the following February he was sent on an errand to a large coal
company's office.  It had been snowing and thawing and the streets were
sloppy.  He soaked his shoes in his progress and came back feeling dull
and weary.  All the next day he felt unusually depressed and sat about
as much as possible, to the irritation of those who admired energy in
others.

In the afternoon some boxes were to be moved to make room for new
culinary supplies.  He was ordered to handle a truck. Encountering a
big box, he could not lift it.

"What's the matter there?" said the head porter.  "Can't you handle
it?"

He was straining to lift it, but now he quit.

"No," he said, weakly.

The man looked at him and saw that he was deathly pale.

"Not sick, are you?" he asked. "I think I am," returned Hurstwood.

"Well, you'd better go sit down, then."

This he did, but soon grew rapidly worse.  It seemed all he could do to
crawl to his room, where he remained for a day.

"That man Wheeler's sick," reported one of the lackeys to the night
clerk.

"What's the matter with him?"

"I don't know.  He's got a high fever."

The hotel physician looked at him.

"Better send him to Bellevue," he recommended.  "He's got pneumonia."

Accordingly, he was carted away.

In three weeks the worst was over, but it was nearly the first of May
before his strength permitted him to be turned out.  Then he was
discharged.

No more weakly looking object ever strolled out into the spring
sunshine than the once hale, lusty manager.  All his corpulence had
fled.  His face was thin and pale, his hands white, his body flabby.
Clothes and all, he weighed but one hundred and thirty-five pounds.
Some old garments had been given him--a cheap brown coat and misfit
pair of trousers.  Also some change and advice. He was told to apply to
the charities.

Again he resorted to the Bowery lodging-house, brooding over where to
look.  From this it was but a step to beggary.

"What can a man do?" he said.  "I can't starve."

His first application was in sunny Second Avenue.  A well-dressed man
came leisurely strolling toward him out of Stuyvesant Park. Hurstwood
nerved himself and sidled near.

"Would you mind giving me ten cents?" he said, directly.  "I'm in a
position where I must ask some one."

The man scarcely looked at him, fished in his vest pocket and took out
a dime.

"There you are," he said.

"Much obliged," said Hurstwood, softly, but the other paid no more
attention to him.

Satisfied with his success and yet ashamed of his situation, he decided
that he would only ask for twenty-five cents more, since that would be
sufficient.  He strolled about sizing up people, but it was long before
just the right face and situation arrived. When he asked, he was
refused.  Shocked by this result, he took an hour to recover and then
asked again.  This time a nickel was given him.  By the most watchful
effort he did get twenty cents more, but it was painful.

The next day he resorted to the same effort, experiencing a variety of
rebuffs and one or two generous receptions.  At last it crossed his
mind that there was a science of faces, and that a man could pick the
liberal countenance if he tried.

It was no pleasure to him, however, this stopping of passers-by. He saw
one man taken up for it and now troubled lest he should be arrested.
Nevertheless, he went on, vaguely anticipating that indefinite
something which is always better.

It was with a sense of satisfaction, then, that he saw announced one
morning the return of the Casino Company, "with Miss Carrie Madenda."
He had thought of her often enough in days past.  How successful she
was--how much money she must have! Even now, however, it took a severe
run of ill luck to decide him to appeal to her.  He was truly hungry
before he said:

"I'll ask her.  She won't refuse me a few dollars."

Accordingly, he headed for the Casino one afternoon, passing it several
times in an effort to locate the stage entrance.  Then he sat in Bryant
Park, a block away, waiting.  "She can't refuse to help me a little,"
he kept saying to himself.

Beginning with half-past six, he hovered like a shadow about the
Thirty-ninth Street entrance, pretending always to be a hurrying
pedestrian and yet fearful lest he should miss his object.  He was
slightly nervous, too, now that the eventful hour had arrived; but
being weak and hungry, his ability to suffer was modified.  At last he
saw that the actors were beginning to arrive, and his nervous tension
increased, until it seemed as if he could not stand much more.

Once he thought he saw Carrie coming and moved forward, only to see
that he was mistaken.

"She can't be long, now," he said to himself, half fearing to encounter
her and equally depressed at the thought that she might have gone in by
another way.  His stomach was so empty that it ached.

Individual after individual passed him, nearly all well dressed, almost
all indifferent.  He saw coaches rolling by, gentlemen passing with
ladies--the evening's merriment was beginning in this region of
theatres and hotels.

Suddenly a coach rolled up and the driver jumped down to open the door.
Before Hurstwood could act, two ladies flounced across the broad walk
and disappeared in the stage door.  He thought he saw Carrie, but it
was so unexpected, so elegant and far away, he could hardly tell.  He
waited a while longer, growing feverish with want, and then seeing that
the stage door no longer opened, and that a merry audience was
arriving, he concluded it must have been Carrie and turned away.

"Lord," he said, hastening out of the street into which the more
fortunate were pouring, "I've got to get something."

At that hour, when Broadway is wont to assume its most interesting
aspect, a peculiar individual invariably took his stand at the corner
of Twenty-sixth Street and Broadway--a spot which is also intersected
by Fifth Avenue.  This was the hour when the theatres were just
beginning to receive their patrons. Fire signs announcing the night's
amusements blazed on every hand.  Cabs and carriages, their lamps
gleaming like yellow eyes, pattered by.  Couples and parties of three
and four freely mingled in the common crowd, which poured by in a thick
stream, laughing and jesting.  On Fifth Avenue were loungers--a few
wealthy strollers, a gentleman in evening dress with his lady on his
arm, some club-men passing from one smoking-room to another. Across the
way the great hotels showed a hundred gleaming windows, their cafes and
billiard-rooms filled with a comfortable, well-dressed, and pleasure-
loving throng.  All about was the night, pulsating with the thoughts of
pleasure and exhilaration--the curious enthusiasm of a great city bent
upon finding joy in a thousand different ways.

This unique individual was no less than an ex-soldier turned
religionist, who, having suffered the whips and privations of our
peculiar social system, had concluded that his duty to the God which he
conceived lay in aiding his fellow-man.  The form of aid which he chose
to administer was entirely original with himself. It consisted of
securing a bed for all such homeless wayfarers as should apply to him
at this particular spot, though he had scarcely the wherewithal to
provide a comfortable habitation for himself.  Taking his place amid
this lightsome atmosphere, he would stand, his stocky figure cloaked in
a great cape overcoat, his head protected by a broad slouch hat,
awaiting the applicants who had in various ways learned the nature of
his charity.  For a while he would stand alone, gazing like any idler
upon an ever fascinating scene.  On the evening in question, a
policeman passing saluted him as "captain," in a friendly way.  An
urchin who had frequently seen him before, stopped to gaze.  All others
took him for nothing out of the ordinary, save in the matter of dress,
and conceived of him as a stranger whistling and idling for his own
amusement.

As the first half-hour waned, certain characters appeared.  Here and
there in the passing crowds one might see, now and then, a loiterer
edging interestedly near.  A slouchy figure crossed the opposite corner
and glanced furtively in his direction.  Another came down Fifth Avenue
to the corner of Twenty-sixth Street, took a general survey, and
hobbled off again.  Two or three noticeable Bowery types edged along
the Fifth Avenue side of Madison Square, but did not venture over.  The
soldier, in his cape overcoat, walked a short line of ten feet at his
corner, to and fro, indifferently whistling.

As nine o'clock approached, some of the hubbub of the earlier hour
passed.  The atmosphere of the hotels was not so youthful. The air,
too, was colder.  On every hand curious figures were moving--watchers
and peepers, without an imaginary circle, which they seemed afraid to
enter--a dozen in all.  Presently, with the arrival of a keener sense
of cold, one figure came forward.  It crossed Broadway from out the
shadow of Twenty-sixth Street, and, in a halting, circuitous way,
arrived close to the waiting figure.  There was something shamefaced or
diffident about the movement, as if the intention were to conceal any
idea of stopping until the very last moment.  Then suddenly, close to
the soldier, came the halt.

The captain looked in recognition, but there was no especial greeting.
The newcomer nodded slightly and murmured something like one who waits
for gifts.  The other simply motioned to-ward the edge of the walk.

"Stand over there," he said.

By this the spell was broken.  Even while the soldier resumed his
short, solemn walk, other figures shuffled forward.  They did not so
much as greet the leader, but joined the one, sniffling and hitching
and scraping their feet.

"Gold, ain't it?"

"I'm glad winter's over."

"Looks as though it might rain."

The motley company had increased to ten.  One or two knew each other
and conversed.  Others stood off a few feet, not wishing to be in the
crowd and yet not counted out.  They were peevish, crusty, silent,
eying nothing in particular and moving their feet.

There would have been talking soon, but the soldier gave them no
chance.  Counting sufficient to begin, he came forward.

"Beds, eh, all of you?"

There was a general shuffle and murmur of approval.

"Well, line up here.  I'll see what I can do.  I haven't a cent
myself."

They fell into a sort of broken, ragged line.  One might see, now, some
of the chief characteristics by contrast.  There was a wooden leg in
the line.  Hats were all drooping, a group that would ill become a
second-hand Hester Street basement collection. Trousers were all warped
and frayed at the bottom and coats worn and faded.  In the glare of the
store lights, some of the faces looked dry and chalky; others were red
with blotches and puffed in the cheeks and under the eyes; one or two
were rawboned and reminded one of railroad hands.  A few spectators
came near, drawn by the seemingly conferring group, then more and more,
and quickly there was a pushing, gaping crowd.  Some one in the line
began to talk.

"Silence!" exclaimed the captain.  "Now, then, gentlemen, these men are
without beds.  They have to have some place to sleep tonight.  They
can't lie out in the streets.  I need twelve cents to put one of them
to bed.  Who will give it to me?"

No reply.

"Well, we'll have to wait here, boys, until some one does. Twelve cents
isn't so very much for one man."

"Here's fifteen," exclaimed a young man, peering forward with strained
eyes.  "It's all I can afford."

"All right.  Now I have fifteen.  Step out of the line," and seizing
one by the shoulder, the captain marched him off a little way and stood
him up alone.

Coming back, he resumed his place and began again.

"I have three cents left.  These men must be put to bed somehow. There
are"--counting--"one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
ten, eleven, twelve men.  Nine cents more will put the next man to bed;
give him a good, comfortable bed for the night.  I go right along and
look after that myself.  Who will give me nine cents?"

One of the watchers, this time a middle-aged man, handed him a five-
cent piece.

"Now, I have eight cents.  Four more will give this man a bed. Come,
gentlemen.  We are going very slow this evening.  You all have good
beds.  How about these?"

"Here you are," remarked a bystander, putting a coin into his hand.

"That," said the captain, looking at the coin, "pays for two beds for
two men and gives me five on the next one.  Who will give me seven
cents more?"

"I will," said a voice.

Coming down Sixth Avenue this evening, Hurstwood chanced to cross east
through Twenty-sixth Street toward Third Avenue.  He was wholly
disconsolate in spirit, hungry to what he deemed an almost mortal
extent, weary, and defeated.  How should he get at Carrie now? It would
be eleven before the show was over.  If she came in a coach, she would
go away in one.  He would need to interrupt under most trying
circumstances.  Worst of all, he was hungry and weary, and at best a
whole day must intervene, for he had not heart to try again to-night.
He had no food and no bed.

When he neared Broadway, he noticed the captain's gathering of
wanderers, but thinking it to be the result of a street preacher or
some patent medicine fakir, was about to pass on.  However, in crossing
the street toward Madison Square Park, he noticed the line of men whose
beds were already secured, stretching out from the main body of the
crowd.  In the glare of the neighboring electric light he recognized a
type of his own kind--the figures whom he saw about the streets and in
the lodging-houses, drifting in mind and body like himself.  He
wondered what it could be and turned back.

There was the captain curtly pleading as before.  He heard with
astonishment and a sense of relief the oft-repeated words: "These men
must have a bed." Before him was the line of unfortunates whose beds
were yet to be had, and seeing a newcomer quietly edge up and take a
position at the end of the line, he decided to do likewise.  What use
to contend? He was weary to-night.  It was a simple way out of one
difficulty, at least.  To-morrow, maybe, he would do better.

Back of him, where some of those were whose beds were safe, a relaxed
air was apparent.  The strain of uncertainty being removed, he heard
them talking with moderate freedom and some leaning toward sociability.
Politics, religion, the state of the government, some newspaper
sensations, and the more notorious facts the world over, found
mouthpieces and auditors there. Cracked and husky voices pronounced
forcibly upon odd matters. Vague and rambling observations were made in
reply.

There were squints, and leers, and some dull, ox-like stares from those
who were too dull or too weary to converse.

Standing tells.  Hurstwood became more weary waiting.  He thought he
should drop soon and shifted restlessly from one foot to the other.  At
last his turn came.  The man ahead had been paid for and gone to the
blessed line of success.  He was now first, and already the captain was
talking for him.

"Twelve cents, gentlemen--twelve cents puts this man to bed.  He
wouldn't stand here in the cold if he had any place to go."

Hurstwood swallowed something that rose to his throat.  Hunger and
weakness had made a coward of him.

"Here you are," said a stranger, handing money to the captain.

Now the latter put a kindly hand on the ex-manager's shoulder. "Line up
over there," he said.

Once there, Hurstwood breathed easier.  He felt as if the world were
not quite so bad with such a good man in it.  Others seemed to feel
like himself about this.

"Captain's a great feller, ain't he?" said the man ahead--a little,
woebegone, helpless-looking sort of individual, who looked as though he
had ever been the sport and care of fortune.

"Yes," said Hurstwood, indifferently.

"Huh! there's a lot back there yet," said a man farther up, leaning out
and looking back at the applicants for whom the captain was pleading.

"Yes.  Must be over a hundred to-night," said another.

"Look at the guy in the cab," observed a third.

A cab had stopped.  Some gentleman in evening dress reached out a bill
to the captain, who took it with simple thanks and turned away to his
line.  There was a general craning of necks as the jewel in the white
shirt front sparkled and the cab moved off. Even the crowd gaped in
awe.

"That fixes up nine men for the night," said the captain, counting out
as many of the line near him.  "Line up over there. Now, then, there
are only seven.  I need twelve cents."

Money came slowly.  In the course of time the crowd thinned out to a
meager handful.  Fifth Avenue, save for an occasional cab or foot
passenger, was bare.  Broadway was thinly peopled with pedestrians.
Only now and then a stranger passing noticed the small group, handed
out a coin, and went away, unheeding.

The captain remained stolid and determined.  He talked on, very slowly,
uttering the fewest words and with a certain assurance, as though he
could not fail.

"Come; I can't stay out here all night.  These men are getting tired
and cold.  Some one give me four cents."

There came a time when he said nothing at all.  Money was handed him,
and for each twelve cents he singled out a man and put him in the other
line.  Then he walked up and down as before, looking at the ground.

The theatres let out.  Fire signs disappeared.  A clock struck eleven.
Another half-hour and he was down to the last two men.

"Come, now," he exclaimed to several curious observers; "eighteen cents
will fix us all up for the night.  Eighteen cents.  I have six.
Somebody give me the money.  Remember, I have to go over to Brooklyn
yet to-night.  Before that I have to take these men down and put them
to bed.  Eighteen cents."

No one responded.  He walked to and fro, looking down for several
minutes, occasionally saying softly: "Eighteen cents." It seemed as if
this paltry sum would delay the desired culmination longer than all the
rest had.  Hurstwood, buoyed up slightly by the long line of which he
was a part, refrained with an effort from groaning, he was so weak.

At last a lady in opera cape and rustling skirts came down Fifth
Avenue, accompanied by her escort.  Hurstwood gazed wearily, reminded
by her both of Carrie in her new world and of the time when he had
escorted his own wife in like manner.

While he was gazing, she turned and, looking at the remarkable company,
sent her escort over.  He came, holding a bill in his fingers, all
elegant and graceful.

"Here you are," he said.

"Thanks," said the captain, turning to the two remaining applicants.
"Now we have some for to-morrow night," he added.

Therewith he lined up the last two and proceeded to the head, counting
as he went.

"One hundred and thirty-seven," he announced.  "Now, boys, line up.
Right dress there.  We won't be much longer about this. Steady, now."

He placed himself at the head and called out "Forward." Hurstwood moved
with the line.  Across Fifth Avenue, through Madison Square by the
winding paths, east on Twenty-third Street, and down Third Avenue wound
the long, serpentine company.  Midnight pedestrians and loiterers
stopped and stared as the company passed.  Chatting policemen, at
various corners, stared indifferently or nodded to the leader, whom
they had seen before.  On Third Avenue they marched, a seemingly weary
way, to Eighth Street, where there was a lodging house, closed,
apparently, for the night.  They were expected, however.

Outside in the gloom they stood, while the leader parleyed within.
Then doors swung open and they were invited in with a "Steady, now."

Some one was at the head showing rooms, so that there was no delay for
keys.  Toiling up the creaky stairs, Hurstwood looked back and saw the
captain, watching; the last one of the line being included in his broad
solicitude.  Then he gathered his cloak about him and strolled out into
the night.

"I can't stand much of this," said Hurstwood, whose legs ached him
painfully, as he sat down upon the miserable bunk in the small,
lightless chamber allotted to him.  "I've got to eat, or I'll die."




Chapter XLVI
STIRRING TROUBLED WATERS

Playing in New York one evening on this her return, Carrie was putting
the finishing touches to her toilet before leaving for the night, when
a commotion near the stage door caught her ear. It included a familiar
voice.

"Never mind, now.  I want to see Miss Madenda."

"You'll have to send in your card."

"Oh, come off! Here."

A half-dollar was passed over, and now a knock came at her dressing-
room door. Carrie opened it.

"Well, well!" said Drouet.  "I do swear! Why, how are you? I knew that
was you the moment I saw you."

Carrie fell back a pace, expecting a most embarrassing conversation.

"Aren't you going to shake hands with me? Well, you're a dandy! That's
all right, shake hands."

Carrie put out her hand, smiling, if for nothing more than the man's
exuberant good-nature.  Though older, he was but slightly changed.  The
same fine clothes, the same stocky body, the same rosy countenance.

"That fellow at the door there didn't want to let me in, until I paid
him.  I knew it was you, all right.  Say, you've got a great show.  You
do your part fine.  I knew you would.  I just happened to be passing to
night and thought I'd drop in for a few minutes. I saw your name on the
program, but I didn't remember it until you came on the stage.  Then it
struck me all at once.  Say, you could have knocked me down with a
feather.  That's the same name you used out there in Chicago, isn't
it?"

"Yes," answered Carrie, mildly, overwhelmed by the man's assurance.

"I knew it was, the moment I saw you.  Well, how have you been,
anyhow?"

"Oh, very well," said Carrie, lingering in her dressing-room. She was
rather dazed by the assault.  "How have you been?"

"Me? Oh, fine.  I'm here now."

"Is that so?" said Carrie.

"Yes.  I've been here for six months.  I've got charge of a branch
here."

"How nice!"

"Well, when did you go on the stage, anyhow?" inquired Drouet.

"About three years ago," said Carrie.

"You don't say so! Well, sir, this is the first I've heard of it. I
knew you would, though.  I always said you could act--didn't I?"

Carrie smiled.

"Yes, you did," she said.

"Well, you do look great," he said.  "I never saw anybody improve so.
You're taller, aren't you?"

"Me? Oh, a little, maybe."

He gazed at her dress, then at her hair, where a becoming hat was set
jauntily, then into her eyes, which she took all occasion to avert.
Evidently he expected to restore their old friendship at once and
without modification.

"Well," he said, seeing her gather up her purse, handkerchief, and the
like, preparatory to departing, "I want you to come out to dinner with
me; won't you? I've got a friend out here."

"Oh, I can't," said Carrie.  "Not to-night.  I have an early engagement
to-morrow."

"Aw, let the engagement go.  Come on.  I can get rid of him.  I want to
have a good talk with you."

"No, no," said Carrie; "I can't.  You mustn't ask me any more.  I don't
care for a late dinner."

"Well, come on and have a talk, then, anyhow."

"Not to-night," she said, shaking her head.  "We'll have a talk some
other time."

As a result of this, she noticed a shade of thought pass over his face,
as if he were beginning to realize that things were changed.  Good-
nature dictated something better than this for one who had always liked
her.

"You come around to the hotel to-morrow," she said, as sort of penance
for error.  "You can take dinner with me."

"All right," said Drouet, brightening.  "Where are you stopping?"

"At the Waldorf," she answered, mentioning the fashionable hostelry
then but newly erected.

"What time?"

"Well, come at three," said Carrie, pleasantly.

The next day Drouet called, but it was with no especial delight that
Carrie remembered her appointment.  However, seeing him, handsome as
ever, after his kind, and most genially disposed, her doubts as to
whether the dinner would be disagreeable were swept away.  He talked as
volubly as ever.

"They put on a lot of lugs here, don't they?" was his first remark.

"Yes; they do," said Carrie.

Genial egotist that he was, he went at once into a detailed account of
his own career.

"I'm going to have a business of my own pretty soon," he observed in
one place.  "I can get backing for two hundred thousand dollars."

Carrie listened most good-naturedly.

"Say," he said, suddenly; "where is Hurstwood now?"

Carrie flushed a little.

"He's here in New York, I guess," she said.  "I haven't seen him for
some time."

Drouet mused for a moment.  He had not been sure until now that the ex-
manager was not an influential figure in the background. He imagined
not; but this assurance relieved him.  It must be that Carrie had got
rid of him--as well she ought, he thought. "A man always makes a
mistake when he does anything like that," he observed.

"Like what?" said Carrie, unwitting of what was coming.

"Oh, you know," and Drouet waved her intelligence, as it were, with his
hand.

"No, I don't," she answered.  "What do you mean?"

"Why that affair in Chicago--the time he left."

"I don't know what you are talking about," said Carrie.  Could it be he
would refer so rudely to Hurstwood's flight with her?

"Oho!" said Drouet, incredulously.  "You knew he took ten thousand
dollars with him when he left, didn't you?"

"What!" said Carrie.  "You don't mean to say he stole money, do you?"

"Why," said Drouet, puzzled at her tone, "you knew that, didn't you?"

"Why, no," said Carrie.  "Of course I didn't."

"Well, that's funny," said Drouet.  "He did, you know.  It was in all
the papers."

"How much did you say he took?" said Carrie.

"Ten thousand dollars.  I heard he sent most of it back afterwards,
though."

Carrie looked vacantly at the richly carpeted floor.  A new light was
shining upon all the years since her enforced flight.  She remembered
now a hundred things that indicated as much.  She also imagined that he
took it on her account.  Instead of hatred springing up there was a
kind of sorrow generated.  Poor fellow! What a thing to have had
hanging over his head all the time.

At dinner Drouet, warmed up by eating and drinking and softened in
mood, fancied he was winning Carrie to her old-time good-natured regard
for him.  He began to imagine it would not be so difficult to enter
into her life again, high as she was.  Ah, what a prize! he thought.
How beautiful, how elegant, how famous! In her theatrical and Waldorf
setting, Carrie was to him the all desirable.

"Do you remember how nervous you were that night at the Avery?" he
asked.

Carrie smiled to think of it.

"I never saw anybody do better than you did then, Cad," he added
ruefully, as he leaned an elbow on the table; "I thought you and I were
going to get along fine those days."

"You mustn't talk that way," said Carrie, bringing in the least touch
of coldness.

"Won't you let me tell you----"

"No," she answered, rising.  "Besides, it's time I was getting ready
for the theatre.  I'll have to leave you.  Come, now."

"Oh, stay a minute," pleaded Drouet.  "You've got plenty of time."

"No," said Carrie, gently.

Reluctantly Drouet gave up the bright table and followed.  He saw her
to the elevator and, standing there, said:

"When do I see you again?"

"Oh, some time, possibly," said Carrie.  "I'll be here all summer.
Good-night!"

The elevator door was open.

"Good-night!" said Drouet, as she rustled in.

Then he strolled sadly down the hall, all his old longing revived,
because she was now so far off.  The merry frou-frou of the place spoke
all of her.  He thought himself hardly dealt with.  Carrie, however,
had other thoughts.

That night it was that she passed Hurstwood, waiting at the Casino,
without observing him.

The next night, walking to the theatre, she encountered him face to
face.  He was waiting, more gaunt than ever, determined to see her, if
he had to send in word.  At first she did not recognize the shabby,
baggy figure.  He frightened her, edging so close, a seemingly hungry
stranger.

"Carrie," he half whispered, "can I have a few words with you?"

She turned and recognized him on the instant.  If there ever had lurked
any feeling in her heart against him, it deserted her now. Still, she
remembered what Drouet said about his having stolen the money.

"Why, George," she said; "what's the matter with you?"

"I've been sick," he answered.  "I've just got out of the hospital.
For God's sake, let me have a little money, will you?"

"Of course," said Carrie, her lip trembling in a strong effort to
maintain her composure.  "But what's the matter with you, anyhow?"

She was opening her purse, and now pulled out all the bills in it--a
five and two twos.

"I've been sick, I told you," he said, peevishly, almost resenting her
excessive pity.  It came hard to him to receive it from such a source.

"Here," she said.  "It's all I have with me."

"All right," he answered, softly.  "I'll give it back to you some day."

Carrie looked at him, while pedestrians stared at her.  She felt the
strain of publicity.  So did Hurstwood.

"Why don't you tell me what's the matter with you?" she asked, hardly
knowing what to do.  "Where are you living?"

"Oh, I've got a room down in the Bowery," he answered.  "There's no use
trying to tell you here.  I'm all right now."

He seemed in a way to resent her kindly inquiries--so much better had
fate dealt with her.

"Better go on in," he said.  "I'm much obliged, but I won't bother you
any more."

She tried to answer, but he turned away and shuffled off toward the
east.

For days this apparition was a drag on her soul before it began to wear
partially away.  Drouet called again, but now he was not even seen by
her.  His attentions seemed out of place.

"I'm out," was her reply to the boy.

So peculiar, indeed, was her lonely, self-withdrawing temper, that she
was becoming an interesting figure in the public eye-she was so quiet
and reserved.

Not long after the management decided to transfer the show to London.
A second summer season did not seem to promise well here.

"How would you like to try subduing London?" asked her manager, one
afternoon.

"It might be just the other way," said Carrie.

"I think we'll go in June," he answered.

In the hurry of departure, Hurstwood was forgotten.  Both he and Drouet
were left to discover that she was gone.  The latter called once, and
exclaimed at the news.  Then he stood in the lobby, chewing the ends of
his moustache.  At last he reached a conclusion--the old days had gone
for good.

"She isn't so much," he said; but in his heart of hearts he did not
believe this.

Hurstwood shifted by curious means through a long summer and fall.  A
small job as janitor of a dance hall helped him for a month.  Begging,
sometimes going hungry, sometimes sleeping in the park, carried him
over more days.  Resorting to those peculiar charities, several of
which, in the press of hungry search, he accidentally stumbled upon,
did the rest.  Toward the dead of winter, Carrie came back, appearing
on Broadway in a new play; but he was not aware of it.  For weeks he
wandered about the city, begging, while the fire sign, announcing her
engagement, blazed nightly upon the crowded street of amusements.

Drouet saw it, but did not venture in.

About this time Ames returned to New York.  He had made a little
success in the West, and now opened a laboratory in Wooster Street.  Of
course, he encountered Carrie through Mrs. Vance; but there was nothing
responsive between them.  He thought she was still united to Hurstwood,
until otherwise informed.  Not knowing the facts then, he did not
profess to understand, and refrained from comment.

With Mrs. Vance, he saw the new play, and expressed himself
accordingly.

"She ought not to be in comedy," he said.  "I think she could do better
than that."

One afternoon they met at the Vances' accidentally, and began a very
friendly conversation.  She could hardly tell why the one-time keen
interest in him was no longer with her. Unquestionably, it was because
at that time he had represented something which she did not have; but
this she did not understand.  Success had given her the momentary
feeling that she was now blessed with much of which he would approve.
As a matter of fact, her little newspaper fame was nothing at all to
him.  He thought she could have done better, by far.

"You didn't go into comedy-drama, after all?" he said, remembering her
interest in that form of art.

"No," she answered; "I haven't, so far."

He looked at her in such a peculiar way that she realized she had
failed.  It moved her to add: "I want to, though."

"I should think you would," he said.  "You have the sort of disposition
that would do well in comedy-drama."

It surprised her that he should speak of disposition.  Was she, then,
so clearly in his mind?

"Why?" she asked.

"Well," he said, "I should judge you were rather sympathetic in your
nature."

Carrie smiled and colored slightly.  He was so innocently frank with
her that she drew nearer in friendship.  The old call of the ideal was
sounding.

"I don't know," she answered, pleased, nevertheless, beyond all
concealment.

"I saw your play," he remarked.  "It's very good."

"I'm glad you liked it."

"Very good, indeed," he said, "for a comedy."

This is all that was said at the time, owing to an interruption, but
later they met again.  He was sitting in a corner after dinner, staring
at the floor, when Carrie came up with another of the guests.  Hard
work had given his face the look of one who is weary.  It was not for
Carrie to know the thing in it which appealed to her.

"All alone?" she said.

"I was listening to the music."

"I'll be back in a moment," said her companion, who saw nothing in the
inventor.

Now he looked up in her face, for she was standing a moment, while he
sat.

"Isn't that a pathetic strain?" he inquired, listening.

"Oh, very," she returned, also catching it, now that her attention was
called.

"Sit down," he added, offering her the chair beside him.

They listened a few moments in silence, touched by the same feeling,
only hers reached her through the heart.  Music still charmed her as in
the old days.

"I don't know what it is about music," she started to say, moved by the
inexplicable longings which surged within her; "but it always makes me
feel as if I wanted something--I----"

"Yes," he replied; "I know how you feel."

Suddenly he turned to considering the peculiarity of her disposition,
expressing her feelings so frankly.

"You ought not to be melancholy," he said.

He thought a while, and then went off into a seemingly alien
observation which, however, accorded with their feelings.

"The world is full of desirable situations, but, unfortunately, we can
occupy but one at a time.  It doesn't do us any good to wring our hands
over the far-off things."

The music ceased and he arose, taking a standing position before her,
as if to rest himself.

"Why don't you get into some good, strong comedy-drama?" he said. He
was looking directly at her now, studying her face.  Her large,
sympathetic eyes and pain-touched mouth appealed to him as proofs of
his judgment.

"Perhaps I shall," she returned.

"That's your field," he added.

"Do you think so?"

"Yes," he said; "I do.  I don't suppose you're aware of it, but there
is something about your eyes and mouth which fits you for that sort of
work."

Carrie thrilled to be taken so seriously.  For the moment, loneliness
deserted her.  Here was praise which was keen and analytical.

"It's in your eyes and mouth," he went on abstractedly.  "I remember
thinking, the first time I saw you, that there was something peculiar
about your mouth.  I thought you were about to cry."

"How odd," said Carrie, warm with delight.  This was what her heart
craved.

"Then I noticed that that was your natural look, and to-night I saw it
again.  There's a shadow about your eyes, too, which gives your face
much this same character.  It's in the depth of them, I think."

Carrie looked straight into his face, wholly aroused.

"You probably are not aware of it," he added.

She looked away, pleased that he should speak thus, longing to be equal
to this feeling written upon her countenance.  It unlocked the door to
a new desire. She had cause to ponder over this until they met again-
several weeks or more.  It showed her she was drifting away from the
old ideal which had filled her in the dressing-rooms of the Avery stage
and thereafter, for a long time.  Why had she lost it?

"I know why you should be a success," he said, another time, "if you
had a more dramatic part.  I've studied it out----"

"What is it?" said Carrie.

"Well," he said, as one pleased with a puzzle, "the expression in your
face is one that comes out in different things.  You get the same thing
in a pathetic song, or any picture which moves you deeply.  It's a
thing the world likes to see, because it's a natural expression of its
longing."

Carrie gazed without exactly getting the import of what he meant.

"The world is always struggling to express itself," he went on "Most
people are not capable of voicing their feelings.  They depend upon
others.  That is what genius is for.  One man expresses their desires
for them in music; another one in poetry; another one in a play.
Sometimes nature does it in a face-it makes the face representative of
all desire.  That's what has happened in your case."

He looked at her with so much of the import of the thing in his eyes
that she caught it.  At least, she got the idea that her look was
something which represented the world's longing.  She took it to heart
as a creditable thing, until he added:

"That puts a burden of duty on you.  It so happens that you have this
thing.  It is no credit to you--that is, I mean, you might not have had
it.  You paid nothing to get it.  But now that you have it, you must do
something with it."

"What?" asked Carrie.

"I should say, turn to the dramatic field.  You have so much sympathy
and such a melodious voice.  Make them valuable to others.  It will
make your powers endure."

Carrie did not understand this last.  All the rest showed her that her
comedy success was little or nothing.

"What do you mean?" she asked.

"Why, just this.  You have this quality in your eyes and mouth and in
your nature.  You can lose it, you know.  If you turn away from it and
live to satisfy yourself alone, it will go fast enough.  The look will
leave your eyes.  Your mouth will change. Your power to act will
disappear.  You may think they won't, but they will.  Nature takes care
of that."

He was so interested in forwarding all good causes that he sometimes
became enthusiastic, giving vent to these preachments. Something in
Carrie appealed to him.  He wanted to stir her up.

"I know," she said, absently, feeling slightly guilty of neglect.

"If I were you," he said, "I'd change."

The effect of this was like roiling helpless waters.  Carrie troubled
over it in her rocking-chair for days.

"I don't believe I'll stay in comedy so very much longer," she
eventually remarked to Lola.

"Oh, why not?" said the latter.

"I think," she said, "I can do better in a serious play."

"What put that idea in your head?"

"Oh, nothing," she answered; "I've always thought so."

Still, she did nothing--grieving.  It was a long way to this better
thing--or seemed so--and comfort was about her; hence the inactivity
and longing.

Chapter XLVII

THE WAY OF THE BEATEN--A HARP IN THE WIND

In the city, at that time, there were a number of charities similar in
nature to that of the captain's, which Hurstwood now patronized in a
like unfortunate way.  One was a convent mission-house of the Sisters
of Mercy in Fifteenth Street--a row of red brick family dwellings,
before the door of which hung a plain wooden contribution box, on which
was painted the statement that every noon a meal was given free to all
those who might apply and ask for aid.  This simple announcement was
modest in the extreme, covering, as it did, a charity so broad.
Institutions and charities are so large and so numerous in New York
that such things as this are not often noticed by the more comfortably
situated.  But to one whose mind is upon the matter, they grow
exceedingly under inspection.  Unless one were looking up this matter
in particular, he could have stood at Sixth Avenue and Fifteenth Street
for days around the noon hour and never have noticed that out of the
vast crowd that surged along that busy thoroughfare there turned out,
every few seconds, some weather-beaten, heavy-footed specimen of
humanity, gaunt in countenance and dilapidated in the matter of
clothes.  The fact is none the less true, however, and the colder the
day the more apparent it became.  Space and a lack of culinary room in
the mission-house, compelled an arrangement which permitted of only
twenty-five or thirty eating at one time, so that a line had to be
formed outside and an orderly entrance effected.  This caused a daily
spectacle which, however, had become so common by repetition during a
number of years that now nothing was thought of it.  The men waited
patiently, like cattle, in the coldest weather-waited for several hours
before they could be admitted.  No questions were asked and no service
rendered.  They ate and went away again, some of them returning
regularly day after day the winter through.

A big, motherly looking woman invariably stood guard at the door during
the entire operation and counted the admissible number. The men moved
up in solemn order.  There was no haste and no eagerness displayed.  It
was almost a dumb procession.  In the bitterest weather this line was
to be found here.  Under an icy wind there was a prodigious slapping of
hands and a dancing of feet.  Fingers and the features of the face
looked as if severely nipped by the cold.  A study of these men in
broad light proved them to be nearly all of a type.  They belonged to
the class that sit on the park benches during the endurable days and
sleep upon them during the summer nights.  They frequent the Bowery and
those down-at-the-heels East Side streets where poor clothes and
shrunken features are not singled out as curious.  They are the men who
are in the lodging house sitting-rooms during bleak and bitter weather
and who swarm about the cheaper shelters which only open at six in a
number of the lower East Side streets. Miserable food, ill-timed and
greedily eaten, had played havoc with bone and muscle.  They were all
pale, flabby, sunken-eyed, hollow-chested, with eyes that glinted and
shone and lips that were a sickly red by contrast.  Their hair was but
half attended to, their ears anemic in hue, and their shoes broken in
leather and run down at heel and toe.  They were of the class which
simply floats and drifts, every wave of people washing up one, as
breakers do driftwood upon a stormy shore.

For nearly a quarter of a century, in another section of the city,
Fleischmann, the baker, had given a loaf of bread to any one who would
come for it to the side door of his restaurant at the corner of
Broadway and Tenth Street, at midnight.  Every night during twenty
years about three hundred men had formed in line and at the appointed
time marched past the doorway, picked their loaf from a great box
placed just outside, and vanished again into the night.  From the
beginning to the present time there had been little change in the
character or number of these men.  There were two or three figures that
had grown familiar to those who had seen this little procession pass
year after year. Two of them had missed scarcely a night in fifteen
years.  There were about forty, more or less, regular callers.  The
remainder of the line was formed of strangers.  In times of panic and
unusual hardships there were seldom more than three hundred.  In times
of prosperity, when little is heard of the unemployed, there were
seldom less.  The same number, winter and summer, in storm or calm, in
good times and bad, held this melancholy midnight rendezvous at
Fleischmann's bread box.

At both of these two charities, during the severe winter which was now
on, Hurstwood was a frequent visitor.  On one occasion it was
peculiarly cold, and finding no comfort in begging about the streets,
he waited until noon before seeking this free offering to the poor.
Already, at eleven o'clock of this morning, several such as he had
shambled forward out of Sixth Avenue, their thin clothes flapping and
fluttering in the wind.  They leaned against the iron railing which
protects the walls of the Ninth Regiment Armory, which fronts upon that
section of Fifteenth Street, having come early in order to be first in.
Having an hour to wait, they at first lingered at a respectful
distance; but others coming up, they moved closer in order to protect
their right of precedence.  To this collection Hurstwood came up from
the west out of Seventh Avenue and stopped close to the door, nearer
than all the others.  Those who had been waiting before him, but
farther away, now drew near, and by a certain stolidity of demeanor, no
words being spoken, indicated that they were first.

Seeing the opposition to his action, he looked sullenly along the line,
then moved out, taking his place at the foot.  When order had been
restored, the animal feeling of opposition relaxed.

"Must be pretty near noon," ventured one.

"It is," said another.  "I've been waiting nearly an hour."

"Gee, but it's cold!"

They peered eagerly at the door, where all must enter.  A grocery man
drove up and carried in several baskets of eatables.  This started some
words upon grocery men and the cost of food in general.

"I see meat's gone up," said one.

"If there wuz war, it would help this country a lot."

The line was growing rapidly.  Already there were fifty or more, and
those at the head, by their demeanor, evidently congratulated
themselves upon not having so long to wait as those at the foot.  There
was much jerking of heads, and looking down the line.

"It don't matter how near you get to the front, so long as you're in
the first twenty-five," commented one of the first twenty-five.  "You
all go in together."

"Humph!" ejaculated Hurstwood, who had been so sturdily displaced.

"This here Single Tax is the thing," said another.  "There ain't going
to be no order till it comes."

For the most part there was silence; gaunt men shuffling, glancing, and
beating their arms.

At last the door opened and the motherly looking sister appeared. She
only looked an order.  Slowly the line moved up and, one by one, passed
in, until twenty-five were counted.  Then she interposed a stout arm,
and the line halted, with six men on the steps.  Of these the ex-
manager was one.  Waiting thus, some talked, some ejaculated concerning
the misery of it; some brooded, as did Hurstwood.  At last he was
admitted, and, having eaten, came away, almost angered because of his
pains in getting it.

At eleven o'clock of another evening, perhaps two weeks later, he was
at the midnight offering of a loaf--waiting patiently.  It had been an
unfortunate day with him, but now he took his fate with a touch of
philosophy.  If he could secure no supper, or was hungry late in the
evening, here was a place he could come.  A few minutes before twelve,
a great box of bread was pushed out, and exactly on the hour a portly,
round-faced German took position by it, calling "Ready." The whole line
at once moved forward each taking his loaf in turn and going his
separate way. On this occasion, the ex-manager ate his as he went
plodding the dark streets in silence to his bed.

By January he had about concluded that the game was up with him. Life
had always seemed a precious thing, but now constant want and weakened
vitality had made the charms of earth rather dull and inconspicuous.
Several times, when fortune pressed most harshly, he thought he would
end his troubles; but with a change of weather, or the arrival of a
quarter or a dime, his mood would change, and he would wait.  Each day
he would find some old paper lying about and look into it, to see if
there was any trace of Carrie, but all summer and fall he had looked in
vain.  Then he noticed that his eyes were beginning to hurt him, and
this ailment rapidly increased until, in the dark chambers of the
lodgings he frequented, he did not attempt to read.  Bad and irregular
eating was weakening every function of his body.  The one recourse left
him was to doze when a place offered and he could get the money to
occupy it.

He was beginning to find, in his wretched clothing and meager state of
body, that people took him for a chronic type of bum and beggar.
Police hustled him along, restaurant and lodging house keepers turned
him out promptly the moment he had his due; pedestrians waved him off.
He found it more and more difficult to get anything from anybody.

At last he admitted to himself that the game was up.  It was after a
long series of appeals to pedestrians, in which he had been refused and
refused--every one hastening from contact.

"Give me a little something, will you, mister?" he said to the last
one.  "For God's sake, do; I'm starving."

"Aw, get out," said the man, who happened to be a common type himself.
"You're no good.  I'll give you nawthin'."

Hurstwood put his hands, red from cold, down in his pockets. Tears came
into his eyes.

"That's right," he said; "I'm no good now.  I was all right.  I had
money.  I'm going to quit this," and, with death in his heart, he
started down toward the Bowery.  People had turned on the gas before
and died; why shouldn't he? He remembered a lodging house where there
were little, close rooms, with gas-jets in them, almost pre-arranged,
he thought, for what he wanted to do, which rented for fifteen cents.
Then he remembered that he had no fifteen cents.

On the way he met a comfortable-looking gentleman, coming, clean-
shaven, out of a fine barber shop.

"Would you mind giving me a little something?" he asked this man
boldly.

The gentleman looked him over and fished for a dime.  Nothing but
quarters were in his pocket.

"Here," he said, handing him one, to be rid of him.  "Be off, now."

Hurstwood moved on, wondering.  The sight of the large, bright coin
pleased him a little.  He remembered that he was hungry and that he
could get a bed for ten cents.  With this, the idea of death passed,
for the time being, out of his mind.  It was only when he could get
nothing but insults that death seemed worth while.

One day, in the middle of the winter, the sharpest spell of the season
set in.  It broke gray and cold in the first day, and on the second
snowed.  Poor luck pursuing him, he had secured but ten cents by
nightfall, and this he had spent for food.  At evening he found himself
at the Boulevard and Sixty-seventh Street, where he finally turned his
face Bowery-ward.  Especially fatigued because of the wandering
propensity which had seized him in the morning, he now half dragged his
wet feet, shuffling the soles upon the sidewalk.  An old, thin coat was
turned up about his red ears--his cracked derby hat was pulled down
until it turned them outward.  His hands were in his pockets.

"I'll just go down Broadway," he said to himself.

When he reached Forty-second Street, the fire signs were already
blazing brightly.  Crowds were hastening to dine.  Through bright
windows, at every corner, might be seen gay companies in luxuriant
restaurants.  There were coaches and crowded cable cars.

In his weary and hungry state, he should never have come here. The
contrast was too sharp.  Even he was recalled keenly to better things.
"What's the use?" he thought.  "It's all up with me.  I'll quit this."

People turned to look after him, so uncouth was his shambling figure.
Several officers followed him with their eyes, to see that he did not
beg of anybody.

Once he paused in an aimless, incoherent sort of way and looked through
the windows of an imposing restaurant, before which blazed a fire sign,
and through the large, plate windows of which could be seen the red and
gold decorations, the palms, the white napery, and shining glassware,
and, above all, the comfortable crowd.  Weak as his mind had become,
his hunger was sharp enough to show the importance of this.  He stopped
stock still, his frayed trousers soaking in the slush, and peered
foolishly in.

"Eat," he mumbled.  "That's right, eat.  Nobody else wants any."

Then his voice dropped even lower, and his mind half lost the fancy it
had.

"It's mighty cold," he said.  "Awful cold."

At Broadway and Thirty-ninth Street was blazing, in incandescent fire,
Carrie's name.  "Carrie Madenda," it read, "and the Casino Company."
All the wet, snowy sidewalk was bright with this radiated fire.  It was
so bright that it attracted Hurstwood's gaze.  He looked up, and then
at a large, gilt-framed posterboard, on which was a fine lithograph of
Carrie, life-size.

Hurstwood gazed at it a moment, snuffling and hunching one shoulder, as
if something were scratching him.  He was so run down, however, that
his mind was not exactly clear.

He approached that entrance and went in.

"Well?" said the attendant, staring at him.  Seeing him pause, he went
over and shoved him.  "Get out of here," he said.

"I want to see Miss Madenda," he said.

"You do, eh?" the other said, almost tickled at the spectacle. "Get out
of here," and he shoved him again.  Hurstwood had no strength to
resist.

"I want to see Miss Madenda," he tried to explain, even as he was being
hustled away.  "I'm all right.  I----"

The man gave him a last push and closed the door.  As he did so,
Hurstwood slipped and fell in the snow.  It hurt him, and some vague
sense of shame returned.  He began to cry and swear foolishly.

"God damned dog!" he said.  "Damned old cur," wiping the slush from his
worthless coat.  "I--I hired such people as you once."

Now a fierce feeling against Carrie welled up--just one fierce, angry
thought before the whole thing slipped out of his mind.

"She owes me something to eat," he said.  "She owes it to me."

Hopelessly he turned back into Broadway again and slopped onward and
away, begging, crying, losing track of his thoughts, one after another,
as a mind decayed and disjointed is wont to do.

It was truly a wintry evening, a few days later, when his one distinct
mental decision was reached.  Already, at four o'clock, the somber hue
of night was thickening the air.  A heavy snow was falling--a fine
picking, whipping snow, borne forward by a swift wind in long, thin
lines.  The streets were bedded with it-six inches of cold, soft
carpet, churned to a dirty brown by the crush of teams and the feet of
men.  Along Broadway men picked their way in ulsters and umbrellas.
Along the Bowery, men slouched through it with collars and hats pulled
over their ears. In the former thoroughfare businessmen and travelers
were making for comfortable hotels.  In the latter, crowds on cold
errands shifted past dingy stores, in the deep recesses of which lights
were already gleaming.  There were early lights in the cable cars,
whose usual clatter was reduced by the mantle about the wheels.  The
whole city was muffled by this fast-thickening mantle.

In her comfortable chambers at the Waldorf, Carrie was reading at this
time "Pere Goriot," which Ames had recommended to her.  It was so
strong, and Ames's mere recommendation had so aroused her interest,
that she caught nearly the full sympathetic significance of it.  For
the first time, it was being borne in upon her how silly and worthless
had been her earlier reading, as a whole.  Becoming wearied, however,
she yawned and came to the window, looking out upon the old winding
procession of carriages rolling up Fifth Avenue.

"Isn't it bad?" she observed to Lola.

"Terrible!" said that little lady, joining her.  "I hope it snows
enough to go sleigh riding."

"Oh, dear," said Carrie, with whom the sufferings of Father Goriot were
still keen.  "That's all you think of.  Aren't you sorry for the people
who haven't anything to-night?"

"Of course I am," said Lola; "but what can I do? I haven't anything."

Carrie smiled.

"You wouldn't care, if you had," she returned.

"I would, too," said Lola.  "But people never gave me anything when I
was hard up."

"Isn't it just awful?" said Carrie, studying the winter's storm.

"Look at that man over there," laughed Lola, who had caught sight of
some one falling down.  "How sheepish men look when they fall, don't
they?"

"We'll have to take a coach to-night," answered Carrie absently.

In the lobby of the Imperial, Mr. Charles Drouet was just arriving,
shaking the snow from a very handsome ulster.  Bad weather had driven
him home early and stirred his desire for those pleasures which shut
out the snow and gloom of life.  A good dinner, the company of a young
woman, and an evening at the theatre were the chief things for him.

"Why, hello, Harry!" he said, addressing a lounger in one of the
comfortable lobby chairs.  "How are you?"

"Oh, about six and six," said the other. "Rotten weather, isn't it?"

"Well, I should say," said the other.  "I've been just sitting here
thinking where I'd go to-night."

"Come along with me," said Drouet.  "I can introduce you to something
dead swell."

"Who is it?" said the other.

"Oh, a couple of girls over here in Fortieth Street.  We could have a
dandy time.  I was just looking for you."

"Supposing you get 'em and take 'em out to dinner?"

"Sure," said Drouet.  "Wait'll I go upstairs and change my clothes."

"Well, I'll be in the barber shop," said the other.  "I want to get a
shave."

"All right," said Drouet, creaking off in his good shoes toward the
elevator.  The old butterfly was as light on the wing as ever.

On an incoming vestibuled Pullman, speeding at forty miles an hour
through the snow of the evening, were three others, all related.

"First call for dinner in the dining-car," a Pullman servitor was
announcing, as he hastened through the aisle in snow-white apron and
jacket.

"I don't believe I want to play any more," said the youngest, a black-
haired beauty, turned supercilious by fortune, as she pushed a euchre
hand away from her.

"Shall we go into dinner?" inquired her husband, who was all that fine
raiment can make.

"Oh, not yet," she answered.  "I don't want to play any more, though."

"Jessica," said her mother, who was also a study in what good clothing
can do for age, "push that pin down in your tie--it's coming up."

Jessica obeyed, incidentally touching at her lovely hair and looking at
a little jewel-faced watch.  Her husband studied her, for beauty, even
cold, is fascinating from one point of view.

"Well, we won't have much more of this weather," he said.  "It only
takes two weeks to get to Rome."

Mrs. Hurstwood nestled comfortably in her corner and smiled.  It was so
nice to be the mother-in-law of a rich young man-one whose financial
state had borne her personal inspection.

"Do you suppose the boat will sail promptly?" asked Jessica, "if it
keeps up like this?"

"Oh, yes," answered her husband.  "This won't make any difference."

Passing down the aisle came a very fair-haired banker's son, also of
Chicago, who had long eyed this supercilious beauty.  Even now he did
not hesitate to glance at her, and she was conscious of it.  With a
specially conjured show of indifference, she turned her pretty face
wholly away.  It was not wifely modesty at all. By so much was her
pride satisfied.

 At this moment Hurstwood stood before a dirty four story building in a
side street quite near the Bowery, whose one-time coat of buff had been
changed by soot and rain.  He mingled with a crowd of men--a crowd
which had been, and was still, gathering by degrees.

It began with the approach of two or three, who hung about the closed
wooden doors and beat their feet to keep them warm.  They had on faded
derby hats with dents in them.  Their misfit coats were heavy with
melted snow and turned up at the collars.  Their trousers were mere
bags, frayed at the bottom and wobbling over big, soppy shoes, torn at
the sides and worn almost to shreds. They made no effort to go in, but
shifted ruefully about, digging their hands deep in their pockets and
leering at the crowd and the increasing lamps.  With the minutes,
increased the number. There were old men with grizzled beards and
sunken eyes, men who were comparatively young but shrunken by diseases,
men who were middle-aged.  None were fat.  There was a face in the
thick of the collection which was as white as drained veal.  There was
another red as brick.  Some came with thin, rounded shoulders, others
with wooden legs, still others with frames so lean that clothes only
flapped about them.  There were great ears, swollen noses, thick lips,
and, above all, red, blood-shot eyes.  Not a normal, healthy face in
the whole mass; not a straight figure; not a straightforward, steady
glance.

In the drive of the wind and sleet they pushed in on one another. There
were wrists, unprotected by coat or pocket, which were red with cold.
There were ears, half covered by every conceivable semblance of a hat,
which still looked stiff and bitten.  In the snow they shifted, now one
foot, now another, almost rocking in unison.

With the growth of the crowd about the door came a murmur.  It was not
conversation, but a running comment directed at any one in general.  It
contained oaths and slang phrases.

"By damn, I wish they'd hurry up."

"Look at the copper watchin'."

"Maybe it ain't winter, nuther!"

"I wisht I was in Sing Sing."

Now a sharper lash of wind cut down and they huddled closer.  It was an
edging, shifting, pushing throng.  There was no anger, no pleading, no
threatening words.  It was all sullen endurance, unlightened by either
wit or good fellowship.

A carriage went jingling by with some reclining figure in it. One of
the men nearest the door saw it.

"Look at the bloke ridin'."

"He ain't so cold."

"Eh, eh, eh!" yelled another, the carriage having long since passed out
of hearing.

Little by little the night crept on.  Along the walk a crowd turned out
on its way home.  Men and shop-girls went by with quick steps.  The
cross-town cars began to be crowded.  The gas lamps were blazing, and
every window bloomed ruddy with a steady flame.  Still the crowd hung
about the door, unwavering.

"Ain't they ever goin' to open up?" queried a hoarse voice,
suggestively.

This seemed to renew the general interest in the closed door, and many
gazed in that direction.  They looked at it as dumb brutes look, as
dogs paw and whine and study the knob.  They shifted and blinked and
muttered, now a curse, now a comment.  Still they waited and still the
snow whirled and cut them with biting flakes.  On the old hats and
peaked shoulders it was piling.  It gathered in little heaps and curves
and no one brushed it off. In the center of the crowd the warmth and
steam melted it, and water trickled off hat rims and down noses, which
the owners could not reach to scratch.  On the outer rim the piles
remained unmelted.  Hurstwood, who could not get in the center, stood
with head lowered to the weather and bent his form.

A light appeared through the transom overhead.  It sent a thrill of
possibility through the watchers.  There was a murmur of recognition.
At last the bars grated inside and the crowd pricked up its ears.
Footsteps shuffled within and it murmured again.  Some one called:
"Slow up there, now," and then the door opened.  It was push and jam
for a minute, with grim, beast silence to prove its quality, and then
it melted inward, like logs floating, and disappeared.  There were wet
hats and wet shoulders, a cold, shrunken, disgruntled mass, pouring in
between bleak walls.  It was just six o'clock and there was supper in
every hurrying pedestrian's face.  And yet no supper was provided here-
-nothing but beds.

Hurstwood laid down his fifteen cents and crept off with weary steps to
his allotted room.  It was a dingy affair--wooden, dusty, hard.  A
small gas jet furnished sufficient light for so rueful a corner.

"Hm!" he said, clearing his throat and locking the door.

Now he began leisurely to take off his clothes, but stopped first with
his coat, and tucked it along the crack under the door.  His vest he
arranged in the same place.  His old wet, cracked hat he laid softly
upon the table.  Then he pulled off his shoes and lay down.

It seemed as if he thought a while, for now he arose and turned the gas
out, standing calmly in the blackness, hidden from view. After a few
moments, in which he reviewed nothing, but merely hesitated, he turned
the gas on again, but applied no match. Even then he stood there,
hidden wholly in that kindness which is night, while the uprising fumes
filled the room.  When the odor reached his nostrils, he quit his
attitude and fumbled for the bed.  "What's the use?" he said, weakly,
as he stretched himself to rest.

And now Carrie had attained that which in the beginning seemed life's
object, or, at least, such fraction of it as human beings ever attain
of their original desires.  She could look about on her gowns and
carriage, her furniture and bank account.  Friends there were, as the
world takes it--those who would bow and smile in acknowledgment of her
success.  For these she had once craved. Applause there was, and
publicity--once far off, essential things, but now grown trivial and
indifferent.  Beauty also-her type of loveliness--and yet she was
lonely.  In her rocking-chair she sat, when not otherwise engaged--
singing and dreaming.

Thus in life there is ever the intellectual and the emotional nature--
the mind that reasons, and the mind that feels.  Of one come the men of
action--generals and statesmen; of the other, the poets and dreamers--
artists all.

As harps in the wind, the latter respond to every breath of fancy,
voicing in their moods all the ebb and flow of the ideal.

Man has not yet comprehended the dreamer any more than he has the
ideal.  For him the laws and morals of the world are unduly severe.
Ever hearkening to the sound of beauty, straining for the flash of its
distant wings, he watches to follow, wearying his feet in traveling.
So watched Carrie, so followed, rocking and singing.

And it must be remembered that reason had little part in this. Chicago
dawning, she saw the city offering more of loveliness than she had ever
known, and instinctively, by force of her moods alone, clung to it.  In
fine raiment and elegant surroundings, men seemed to be contented.
Hence, she drew near these things. Chicago, New York; Drouet,
Hurstwood; the world of fashion and the world of stage--these were but
incidents.  Not them, but that which they represented, she longed for.
Time proved the representation false.

Oh, the tangle of human life!  How dimly as yet we see.  Here was
Carrie, in the beginning poor, unsophisticated.  emotional; responding
with desire to everything most lovely in life, yet finding herself
turned as by a wall.  Laws to say: "Be allured, if you will, by
everything lovely, but draw not nigh unless by righteousness."
Convention to say: "You shall not better your situation save by honest
labor." If honest labor be unremunerative and difficult to endure; if
it be the long, long road which never reaches beauty, but wearies the
feet and the heart; if the drag to follow beauty be such that one
abandons the admired way, taking rather the despised path leading to
her dreams quickly, who shall cast the first stone? Not evil, but
longing for that which is better, more often directs the steps of the
erring.  Not evil, but goodness more often allures the feeling mind
unused to reason.

Amid the tinsel and shine of her state walked Carrie, unhappy. As when
Drouet took her, she had thought: "Now I am lifted into that which is
best"; as when Hurstwood seemingly offered her the better way: "Now am
I happy." But since the world goes its way past all who will not
partake of its folly, she now found herself alone.  Her purse was open
to him whose need was greatest.  In her walks on Broadway, she no
longer thought of the elegance of the creatures who passed her.  Had
they more of that peace and beauty which glimmered afar off, then were
they to be envied.

Drouet abandoned his claim and was seen no more.  Of Hurstwood's death
she was not even aware.  A slow, black boat setting out from the pier
at Twenty-seventh Street upon its weekly errand bore, with many others,
his nameless body to the Potter's Field.

Thus passed all that was of interest concerning these twain in their
relation to her.  Their influence upon her life is explicable alone by
the nature of her longings.  Time was when both represented for her all
that was most potent in earthly success.  They were the personal
representatives of a state most blessed to attain--the titled
ambassadors of comfort and peace, aglow with their credentials.  It is
but natural that when the world which they represented no longer
allured her, its ambassadors should be discredited.  Even had Hurstwood
returned in his original beauty and glory, he could not now have
allured her.  She had learned that in his world, as in her own present
state, was not happiness.

Sitting alone, she was now an illustration of the devious ways by which
one who feels, rather than reasons, may be led in the pursuit of
beauty.  Though often disillusioned, she was still waiting for that
halcyon day when she would be led forth among dreams become real.  Ames
had pointed out a farther step, but on and on beyond that, if
accomplished, would lie others for her.  It was forever to be the
pursuit of that radiance of delight which tints the distant hilltops of
the world.

Oh, Carrie, Carrie! Oh, blind strivings of the human heart! Onward
onward, it saith, and where beauty leads, there it follows.  Whether it
be the tinkle of a lone sheep bell o'er some quiet landscape, or the
glimmer of beauty in sylvan places, or the show of soul in some passing
eye, the heart knows and makes answer, following.  It is when the feet
weary and hope seems vain that the heartaches and the longings arise.
Know, then, that for you is neither surfeit nor content.  In your
rocking chair, by your window dreaming, shall you long, alone.  In your
rocking chair, by your window, shall you dream such happiness as you
may never feel.

CHAPTER 1


Jonathan Harker's Journal




3 May. Bistritz. Left Munich at 8:35 P.M., on 1st May,
arriving at Vienna early next morning; should have arrived
at 6:46, but train was an hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a won-
derful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the
train and the little I could walk through the streets. I
feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived
late and would start as near the correct time as possible.

The impression I had was that we were leaving the West
and entering the East; the most western of splendid bridges
over the Danube, which is here of noble width and depth,
took us among the traditions of Turkish rule.

We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall
to Klausenburgh. Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel
Royale. I had for dinner, or rather supper, a chicken done
up some way with red pepper, which was very good but thirsty.
(Mem. get recipe for Mina.) I asked the waiter, and he said
it was called "paprika hendl," and that, as it was a nation-
al dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the Car-
pathians.

I found my smattering of German very useful here, in-
deed, I don't know how I should be able to get on without
it.

Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I
had visited the British Museum, and made search among the
books and maps in the library regarding Transylvania; it
had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could
hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a
nobleman of that country.


I find that the district he named is in the extreme
east of the country, just on the borders of three states,
Transylvania, Moldavia, and Bukovina, in the midst of the
Carpathian mountains; one of the wildest and least known
portions of Europe.

I was not able to light on any map or work giving the
exact locality of the Castle Dracula, as there are no maps
of this country as yet to compare with our own Ordance
Survey Maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post town named
by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall
enter here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory
when I talk over my travels with Mina.

In the population of Transylvania there are four dis-
tinct nationalities: Saxons in the South, and mixed with
them the Wallachs, who are the descendants of the Dacians;
Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the East and North. I
am going among the latter, who claim to be descended from
Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars
conquered the country in the eleventh century they found
the Huns settled in it.

I read that every known superstition in the world is
gathered into the horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it
were the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool; if
so my stay may be very interesting. (Mem., I must ask the
Count all about them.)

I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable
enough, for I had all sorts of queer dreams. There was
a dog howling all night under my window, which may have
had something to do with it; or it may have been the
paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my car-
afe, and was still thirsty. Towards morning I slept
and was wakened by the continuous knocking at my door,
so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then.

I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of
porridge of maize flour which they said was "mamaliga",
and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a very excellent
dish, which they call "impletata". (Mem., get recipe for this
also.)

I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a
little before eight, or rather it ought to have done so,
for after rushing to the station at 7:30 I had to sit in
the carriage for more than an hour before we began to move.

It seems to me that the further east you go the more
unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?

All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country
which was full of beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw
little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we
see in old missals; sometimes we ran by rivers and streams
which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them
to be subject ot great floods. It takes a lot of water, and
running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear.

At every station there were groups of people, sometimes
crowds, and in all sorts of attire. Some of them were just
like the peasants at home or those I saw coming through
France and Germany, with short jackets, and round hats, and
home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque.

The women looked pretty, except when you got near them,
but they were very clumsy about the waist. They had all
full white sleeves of some kind or other, and most of them
had big belts with a lot of strips of something fluttering
from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there
were petticoats under them.

The strangest figures we saw were the Slovaks, who
were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy
hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts,
and enormous heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all
studded over with brass nails. They wore high boots, with
their trousers tucked into them, and had long black hair
and heavy black moustaches. They are very picturesque,
but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would
be set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands.
They are, however, I am told, very harmless and rather
wanting in natural self-assertion.

It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to
Bistritz, which is a very interesting old place. Being
practically on the frontier--for the Borgo Pass leads from
it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy existence, and
it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series
of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on
five separate occasions. At the very beginning of the
seventeenth century it underwent a siege of three weeks
and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war proper be-
ing assisted by famine and disease.

Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden
Krone Hotel, which I found, to my great delight, to be
thoroughly old-fashioned, for of course I wanted to see all
I could of the ways of the country.

I was evidently expected, for when I got near the
door I faced a cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual
peasant dress--white undergarment with a long double apron,
front, and back, of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight
for modesty. When I came close she bowed and said, "The
Herr Englishman?"

"Yes," I said, "Jonathan Harker."

She smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in
white shirt-sleeves, who had followed her to the door.

He went, but immediately returned with a letter:


"My friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxious-
ly expecting you. Sleep well tonight. At three tomorrow
the diligence will start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept
for you. At the Borgo Pass my carriage will await you and
will bring you to me. I trust that your journey from London
has been a happy one, and that you will enjoy your stay in
my beautiful land.--Your friend, Dracula."


4 May--I found that my landlord had got a letter from
the Count, directing him to secure the best place on the
coach for me; but on making inquiries as to details he seem-
ed somewhat reticent, and pretended that he could not under-
stand my German.

This could not be true, because up to then he had under-
stood it perfectly; at least, he answered my questions
exactly as if he did.

He and his wife, the old lady who had received me, look-
ed at each other in a frightened sort of way. He mumbled out
that the money had been sent in a letter,and that was all he
knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could
tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed
themselves, and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply
refused to speak further. It was so near the time of start-
ing that I had no time to ask anyone else, for it was all
very mysterious and not by any means comforting.

Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my
room and said in a hysterical way: "Must you go? Oh! Young
Herr, must you go?" She was in such an excited state that
she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew,
and mixed it all up with some other language which I did
not know at all. I was just able to follow her by asking
many questions. When I told her that I must go at once, and
that I was engaged on important business, she asked again:

"Do you know what day it is?" I answered that it was
the fourth of May. She shook her head as she said again:

"Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know
what day it is?"

On my saying that I did not understand, she went on:

"It is the eve of St. George's Day. Do you not know
that to-night, when the clock strikes midnight, all the
evil things in the world will have full sway? Do you know
where you are going, and what you are going to?" She was
in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but
without effect. Finally, she went down on her knees and
implored me not to go; at least to wait a day or two be-
fore starting.

It was all very ridiculous but I did not feel com-
fortable. However, there was business to be done, and I
could allow nothing to interfere with it.

I tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I
could, that I thanked her, but my duty was imperative, and
that I must go.

She then rose and dried her eyes, and taking a cruci-
fix from her neck offered it to me.

I did not know what to do, for, as an English Church-
man, I have been taught to regard such things as in some
measure idolatrous, and yet it seemed so ungracious to re-
fuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a state of
mind.

She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put
the rosary round my neck and said, "For your mother's sake,"
and went out of the room.

I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am
waiting for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the
crucifix is still round my neck.

Whether it is the old lady's fear, or the many ghostly
traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not
know, but I am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as
usual.

If this book should ever reach Mina before I do, let
it bring my good-bye. Here comes the coach!


5 May. The Castle.--The gray of the morning has passed,
and the sun is high over the distant horizon, which seems
jagged, whether with trees or hills I know not, for it is
so far off that big things and little are mixed.

I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I
awake, naturally I write till sleep comes.

There are many odd things to put down, and, lest who
reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I left
Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly.

I dined on what they called "robber steak"--bits of
bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red pepper, and
strung on sticks, and roasted over the fire, in simple style
of the London cat's meat!

The wine was Golden Mediasch, which produces a queer
sting on the tongue, which is, however, not disagreeable.

I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing
else.

When I got on the coach, the driver had not taken his
seat, and I saw him talking to the landlady.

They were evidently talking of me, for every now and
then they looked at me, and some of the people who were
sitting on the bench outside the door--came and listened,
and then looked at me, most of them pityingly. I could hear
a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for there were
many nationalities in the crowd, so I quietly got my polyglot
dictionary from my bag and looked them out.

I must say they were not cheering to me, for amongst
them were "Ordog"--Satan, "Pokol"--hell, "stregoica"--witch,
"vrolok" and "vlkoslak"--both mean the same thing, one being
Slovak and the other Servian for something that is either
werewolf or vampire. (Mem., I must ask the Count about these
superstitions.)

When we started, the crowd round the inn door, which
had by this time swelled to a considerable size, all made
the sign of the cross and pointed two fingers towards me.

With some difficulty, I got a fellow passenger to tell
me what they meant. He would not answer at first, but on
learning that I was English, he explained that it was a
charm or guard against the evil eye.

This was not very pleasant for me, just starting for an
unknown place to meet an unknown man. But everyone seemed
so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I
could not but be touched.

I shall never forget the last glimpse which I had of
the inn yard and its crowd of picturesque figures,all cross-
ing themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with
its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees
in green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard.

Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered the
whole front of the boxseat,--"gotza" they call them--cracked
his big whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast,
and we set off on our journey.

I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in
the beauty of the scene as we drove along, although had I
known the language, or rather languages, which my fellow-
passengers were speaking, I might not have been able to
throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping
land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep
hills, crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the
blank gable end to the road. There was everywhere a bewild-
ering mass of fruit blossom--apple, plum, pear, cherry. And
as we drove by I could see the green grass under the trees
spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these
green hills of what they call here the "Mittel Land" ran the
road, losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or
was shut out by the straggling ends of pine woods, which
here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame.
The road was rugged, but still we seemed to fly over it with
a feverish haste. I could not understand then what the haste
meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time
in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in
summertime excellent, but that it had not yet been put in
order after the winter snows. In this respect it is differ-
ent from the general run of roads in the Carpathians, for it
is an old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good
order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the
Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in for-
eign troops, and so hasten the war which was always really
at loading point.

Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose
mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Car-
pathians themselves. Right and left of us they towered, with
the afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing out
all the glorious colours of this beautiful range, deep blue
and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where
grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged
rock and pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in
the distance, where the snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and
there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains, through which,
as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again the white
gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm
as we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty,
snow-covered peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on
our serpentine way, to be right before us.

"Look! Isten szek!"--"God's seat!"--and he crossed him-
self reverently.

As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower
and lower behind us, the shadows of the evening began to
creep round us. This was emphasized by the fact that the
snowy mountain-top still held the sunset, and seemed to glow
out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there we passed
Cszeks and slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed
that goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were
many crosses, and as we swept by, my companions all crossed
themselves. Here and there was a peasant man or woman kneel-
ing before a shrine, who did not even turn round as we
approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of devotion to
have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were
many things new to me. For instance, hay-ricks in the trees,
and here and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch,
their white stems shining like silver through the delicate
green of the leaves.

Now and again we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary
peasants's cart--with its long, snakelike vertebra, calcu-
lated to suit the inequalities of the road. On this were
sure to be seated quite a group of homecoming peasants, the
Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their coloured
sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long
staves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get
very cold, and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one
dark mistiness the gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine,
though in the valleys which ran deep between the spurs of
the hills, as we ascended through the Pass, the dark firs
stood out here and there against the background of late-
lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine
woods that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon
us, great masses of greyness which here and there bestrewed
the trees, produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect,
which carried on the thoughts and grim fancies engendered
earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset threw into
strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the
Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys.
Sometimes the hills were so steep that, despite our driver's
haste, the horses could only go slowly. I wished to get down
and walk up them, as we do at home, but the driver would not
hear of it. "No, no," he said. "You must not walk here. The
dogs are too fierce." And then he added, with what he evi-
dently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to
catch the approving smile of the rest--"And you may have
enough of such matters before you go to sleep." The only
stop he would make was a moment's pause to light his lamps.

When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement
amongst the passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one
after the other, as though urging him to further speed. He
lashed the horses unmercifully with his long whip, and with
wild cries of encouragement urged them on to further
exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of
patch of grey light ahead of us,as though there were a cleft
in the hills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater.
The crazy coach rocked on its great leather springs, and
swayed like a boat tossed on a stormy sea. I had to hold on.
The road grew more level, and we appeared to fly along. Then
the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each side and
to frown down upon us. We were entering on the Borgo Pass.
One by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which
they pressed upon me with an earnestness which would take no
denial. These were certainly of an odd and varied kind, but
each was given in simple good faith, with a kindly word, and
a blessing, and that same strange mixture of fear-meaning
movements which I had seen outside the hotel at Bistritz--
the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.
Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on
each side the passengers, craning over the edge of the coach,
peered eagerly into the darkness. It was evident that some-
thing very exciting was either happening or expected, but
though I asked each passenger, no one would give me the
slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for
some little time. And at last we saw before us the Pass
opening out on the eastern side. There were dark, rolling
clouds overhead, and in the air the heavy, oppressive sense
of thunder. It seemed as though the mountain range had sepa-
rated two atmospheres, and that now we had got into the
thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the convey-
ance which was to take me to the Count. Each moment I
expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness, but
all was dark. The only light was the flickering rays of our
own lamps, in which the steam from our hard-driven horses
rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy road lying
white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.
The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which
seemed to mock my own disappointment. I was already thinking
what I had best do, when the driver, looking at his watch,
said to the others something which I could hardly hear, it
was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone, I thought it was
"An hour less than the time." Then turning to me, he spoke
in German worse than my own.

"There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected
after all. He will now come on to Bukovina, and return tomor-
row or the next day, better the next day." Whilst he was
speaking the horses began to neigh and snort and plunge
wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then, amongst
a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal cross-
ing of themselves, a caleche, with four horses, drove up be-
hind us, overtook us, and drew up beside the coach. I could
see from the flash of our lamps as the rays fell on them,
that the horses were coal-black and splendid animals. They
were driven by a tall man, with a long brown beard and a
great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I
could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which
seemed red in the lamplight, as he turned to us.

He said to the driver, "You are early tonight, my
friend."

The man stammered in reply, "The English Herr was in
a hurry."

To which the stranger replied, "That is why, I suppose,
you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot deceive me,
my friend. I know too much, and my horses are swift."

As he spoke he smiled,and the lamplight fell on a hard-
looking mouth, with very red lips and sharp-looking teeth,
as white as ivory. One of my companions whispered to another
the line from Burger's "Lenore".

"Denn die Todten reiten Schnell."
("For the dead travel fast.")


The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he
looked up with a gleaming smile. The passenger turned his
face away, at the same time putting out his two fingers and
crossing himself. "Give me the Herr's luggage," said the
driver, and with exceeding alacrity my bags were handed out
and put in the caleche. Then I descended from the side of
the coach, as the caleche was close alongside, the driver
helping me with a hand which caught my arm in a grip of
steel. His strength must have been prodigious.

Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned,
and we swept into the darkness of the pass. As I looked back
I saw the steam from the horses of the coach by the light
of the lamps,and projected against it the figures of my late
companions crossing themselves. Then the driver cracked his
whip and called to his horses, and off they swept on their
way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a
strange chill, and a lonely feeling come over me. But a
cloak was thrown over my shoulders, and a rug across my
knees, and the driver said in excellent German--

"The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count
bade me take all care of you. There is a flask of slivovitz
(the plum brandy of the country) underneath the seat, if you
should require it."

I did not take any, but it was a comfort to know it was
there all the same. I felt a little strangely, and not a
little frightened. I think had there been any alternative I
should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that unknown
night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight
along, then we made a complete turn and went along another
straight road. It seemed to me that we were simply going
over and over the same ground again, and so I took note of
some salient point, and found that this was so. I would have
liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but I
really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was,
any protest would have had no effect in case there had been
an intention to delay.

By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time
was passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my
watch. It was within a few minutes of midnight. This gave me
a sort of shock, for I suppose the general superstition
about midnight was increased by my recent experiences. I
waited with a sick feeling of suspense.

Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far
down the road, a long, agonized wailing, as if from fear.
The sound was taken up by another dog, and then another and
another, till, borne on the wind which now sighed softly
through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed to come
from all over the country, as far as the imagination could
grasp it through the gloom of the night.

At the first howl the horses began to strain and rear,
but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they quieted
down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway
from sudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the
mountains on each side of us began a louder and a sharper
howling, that of wolves, which affected both the horses and
myself in the same way. For I was minded to jump from the
caleche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged madly,
so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep
them from bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears
got accustomed to the sound, and the horses so far became
quiet that the driver was able to descend and to stand be-
fore them.

He petted and soothed them, and whispered something in
their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers doing, and with
extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became
quite manageable again, though they still trembled. The
driver again took his seat, and shaking his reins, started
off at a great pace. This time, after going to the far side
or the Pass, he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which
ran sharply to the right.

Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places
arched right over the roadway till we passed as through a
tunnel. And again great frowning rocks guarded us boldly on
either side. Though we were in shelter, we could hear the
rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the rocks,
and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept
along. It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery
snow began to fall, so that soon we and all around us were
covered with a white blanket. The keen wind still carried
the howling of the dogs, though this grew fainter as we went
on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer and near-
er, as though they were closing round on us from every side.
I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The
driver, however, was not in the least disturbed. He kept turn-
ing his head to left and right, but I could not see anything
through the darkness.

Suddenly, away on our left I saw a fain flickering blue
flame. The driver saw it at the same moment. He at once
checked the horses, and, jumping to the ground, disappeared
into the darkness. I did not know what to do, the less as
the howling of the wolves grew closer. But while I wondered,
the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took
his seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have
fallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident, for it
seemed to be repeated endlessly, and now looking back, it is
like a sort of awful nightmare. Once the flame appeared so
near the road, that even in the darkness around us I could
watch the driver's motions. He went rapidly to where the
blue flame arose, it must have been very faint, for it did
not seem to illumine the place around it at all, and gather-
ing a few stones, formed them into some device.

Once there appeared a strange optical effect. When he
stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it, for I
could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me,
but as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes
deceived me straining through the darkness. Then for a time
there were no blue flames, and we sped onwards through the
gloom, with the howling of the wolves around us, as though
they were following in a moving circle.

At last there came a time when the driver went further
afield than he had yet gone, and during his absence, the
horses began to tremble worse than ever and to snort and
scream with fright. I could not see any cause for it, for the
howling of the wolves had ceased altogether. But just then
the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind
the jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its
light I saw around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and
lolling red tongues, with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair.
They were a hundred times more terrible in the grim silence
which held them than even when they howled. For myself, I
felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man feels
himself face to face with such horrors that he can under-
stand their true import.

All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moon-
light had had some peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped
about and reared, and looked helplessly round with eyes that
rolled in a way painful to see.  But the living ring of terror
encompassed them on every side, and they had perforce to
remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, for it
seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out
through the ring and to aid his approach, I shouted and beat
the side of the caleche, hoping by the noise to scare the
wolves from the side, so as to give him a chance of reaching
the trap. How he came there, I know not, but I heard his
voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and looking
towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept
his long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable
obstacle, the wolves fell back and back further still. Just
then a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon, so
that we were again in darkness.

When I could see again the driver was climbing into the
caleche, and the wolves disappeared. This was all so strange
and uncanny that a dreadful fear came upon me, and I was
afraid to speak or move. The time seemed interminable as we
swept on our way, now in almost complete darkness, for the
rolling clouds obscured the moon.

We kept on ascending, with occasional periods of quick
descent, but in the main always ascending. Suddenly, I became
conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pull-
ing up the horses in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle,
from whose tall black windows came no ray of light,and whose
broken battlements showed a jagged line against the sky.





CHAPTER 2


Jonathan Harker's Journal Continued



5 May.--I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had
been fully awake I must have noticed the approach of such a
remarkable place. In the gloom the courtyard looked of con-
siderable size, and as several dark ways led from it under
great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than it really
is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.

When the caleche stopped, the driver jumped down and
held out his hand to assist me to alight. Again I could not
but notice his prodigious strength. His hand actually seemed
like a steel vice that could have crushed mine if he had
chosen. Then he took my traps, and placed them on the ground
beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and studded
with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of
massive stone. I could see even in th e dim light that the
stone was massively carved, but that the carving had been
much worn by time and weather. As I stood, the driver jump-
ed again into his seat and shook the reins. The horses start-
ed forward,and trap and all disappeared down one of the dark
openings.

I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what
to do. Of bell or knocker there was no sign. Through these
frowning walls and dark window openings it was not likely
that my voice could penetrate. The time I waited seemed end-
less, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon me. What
sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?
What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked?
Was this a customary incident in the life of a solicitor's
clerk sent out to explain the purchase of a London estate
to a foreigner? Solicitor's clerk! Mina would not like that.
Solicitor, for just before leaving London I got word that my
examination was successful, and I am now a full-blown solic-
itor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if I
were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me,
and I expected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself
at home, with the dawn struggling in through the windows, as
I had now and again felt in the morning after a day of over-
work. But my flesh answered the pinching test, and my eyes
were not to be deceived. I was indeed awake and among the
Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and to
wait the coming of morning.

Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy
step approaching behind the great door, and saw through the
chinks the gleam of a coming light. Then there was the
sound of rattling chains and the clanking of massive bolts
drawn back. A key was turned with the loud grating noise of
long disuse, and the great door swung back.

Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a
long white moustache, and clad in black from head to foot,
without a single speck of colour about him anywhere. He
held in his hand an antique silver lamp, in which the flame
burned without a chimney or globe of any kind, throwing long
quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the open
door. The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a
courtly gesture, saying in excellent English, but with a
strange intonation.

"Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own free
will!" He made no motion of stepping to meet me, but stood
like a statue,as though his gesture of welcome had fixed him
into stone. The instant, however, that I had stepped over the
threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and holding out his
hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince, an
effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed
cold as ice, more like the hand of a dead than a living man.
Again he said.

"Welcome to my house! Enter freely. Go safely, and leave
something of the happiness you bring!" The strength of the
handshake was so much akin to that which I had noticed in
the driver, whose face I had not seen, that for a moment I
doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was speak-
ing. So to make sure, I said interrogatively, "Count Drac-
ula?"

He bowed in a courtly was as he replied, "I am Dracula,
and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in, the
night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest."As he
was speaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and
stepping out, took my luggage. He had carried it in before I
could forestall him. I protested, but he insisted.

"Nay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people
are not available. Let me see to your comfort myself."He in-
sisted on carrying my traps along the passage, and then up a
great winding stair, and along another great passage, on
whose stone floor our steps rang heavily. At the end of this
he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced to see within a
well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper, and on
whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished,
flamed and flared.

The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door,
and crossing the room, opened another door, which led into a
small octagonal room lit by a single lamp, and seemingly
without a window of any sort. Passing through this, he open-
ed another door, and motioned me to enter. It was a welcome
sight. For here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed
with another log fire, also added to but lately, for the top
logs were fresh, which sent a hollow roar up the wide chim-
ney. The Count himself left my luggage inside and withdrew,
saying, before he closed the door.

"You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself
by making your toilet. I trust you will find all you wish.
When you are ready, come into the other room, where you will
find your supper prepared."

The light and warmth and the Count's courteous welcome
seemed to have dissipated all my doubts and fears. Having
then reached my normal state, I discovered that I was half
famished with hunger. So making a hasty toilet, I went into
the other room.

I found supper already laid out. My host, who stood on
one side of the great fireplace, leaning against the stone-
work, made a graceful wave of his hand to the table, and
said,

"I pray you, be seated and sup how you please. You will
I trust, excuse me that I do not join you, but I have dined
already, and I do not sup."

I handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had
entrusted to me. He opened it and read it gravely. Then,
with a charming smile, he handed it to me to read. One pass-
age of it, at least, gave me a thrill of pleasure.

"I must regret that an attack of gout, from which mal-
ady I am a constant sufferer, forbids absolutely any travel-
ling on my part for some time to come. But I am happy to say
I can send a sufficient substitute, one in whom I have every
possible confidence. He is a young man, full of energy and
talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition.
He is discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my
service. He shall be ready to attend on you when you will
during his stay, and shall take your instructions in all
matters."

The count himself came forward and took off the cover
of a dish, and I fell to at once on an excellent roast
chicken. This, with some cheese and a salad and a bottle of
old tokay, of which I had two glasses, was my supper. During
the time I was eating it the Count asked me many question
as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had
experienced.

By this time I had finished my supper,and by my host's
desire had drawn up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke
a cigar which he offered me, at the same time excusing him-
self that he did not smoke. I had now an opportunity of
observing him, and found him of a very marked physiognomy.

His face was a strong, a very strong, aquiline, with
high bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils,
with lofty domed forehead, and hair growing scantily round
the temples but profusely elsewhere. His eyebrows were very
massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy hair
that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so
far as I could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed
and rather cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth.
These protruded over the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness
showed astonishing vitality in a man of his years. For the
rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops extremely point-
ed. The chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm
though thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary
pallor.

Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they
lay on his knees in the firelight, and they had seemed
rather white and fine. But seeing them now close to me, I
could not but notice that they were rather coarse, broad,
with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in the
centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut
to a sharp point. As the Count leaned over me and his hands
touched me, I could not repress a shudder. It may have been
that his breath was rank, but a horrible feeling of nausea
came over me, which, do what I would, I could not conceal.

The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back. And with
a grim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet
done his protruberant teeth, sat himself down again on his
own side of the fireplace. We were both silent for a while,
and as I looked towards the window I saw the first dim
streak of the coming dawn. There seemed a strange stillness
over everything. But as I listened, I heard as if from down
below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count's
eyes gleamed, and he said.

"Listen to them, the children of the night. What music
they make!" Seeing, I suppose, some expression in my face
strange to him, he added, "Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city
cannot enter into the feelings of the hunter." Then he rose
and said.

"But you must be tired. Your bedroom is all ready, and
tomorrow you shall sleep as late as you will. I have to be
away till the afternoon, so sleep well and dream well!"
With a courteous bow, he opened for me himself the door to
the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom.

I am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt. I fear. I think
strange things, which I dare not confess to my own soul.
God keep me, if only for the sake of those dear to me!


7 May.--It is again early morning, but I have rested
and enjoyed the last twenty-four hours. I slept till late
in the day, and awoke of my own accord. When I had dressed
myself I went into the room where we had supped, and found
a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the pot
being placed on the hearth. There was a card on the table,
on which was written--

"I have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me.
D." I set to and enjoyed a hearty meal. When I had done,
I looked for a bell, so that I might let the servants know
I had finished, but I could not find one. There are cer-
tainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the ex-
traordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The
table service is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that
it must be of immense value. The curtains and upholstery
of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of my bed are of
the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have
been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are
centuries old, though in excellent order. I saw something
like them in Hampton Court, but they were worn and frayed
and moth-eaten. But still in none of the rooms is there a
mirror. There is not even a toilet glass on my table, and
I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I
could either shave or brush my hair. I have not yet seen a
servant anywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except
the howling of wolves. Some time after I had finished my
meal, I do not know whether to call it breakfast of dinner,
for it was between five and six o'clock when I had it, I
looked about for something to read, for I did not like to
go about the castle until I had asked the Count's permiss-
ion. There was absolutely nothing in the room, book, news-
paper, or even writing materials, so I opened another door
in the room and found a sort of library. The door opposite
mine I tried, but found locked.

In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast
number of English books, whole shelves full of them, and
bound volumes of magazines and newspapers. A table in the
center was littered with English magazines and newspapers,
though none of them were of very recent date. The books
were of the most varied kind, history, geography, politics,
political economy, botany, geology, law, all relating to
England and English life and customs and manners. There
were even such books of reference as the London Directory,
the "Red" and "Blue" books, Whitaker's Almanac, the Army
and Navy Lists, and it somehow gladdened my heart to see
it, the Law List.

Whilst I was looking at the books, the door opened,
and the Count entered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and
hoped that I had had a good night's rest. Then he went on.

"I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure
there is much that will interest you. These companions,"
and he laid his hand on some of the books, "have been good
friends to me, and for some years past, ever since I had
the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours
of pleasure. Through them I have come to know your great
England, and to know her is to love her. I long to go
through the crowded streets of your mighty London, to be
in the midst of the whirl and rush of humanity, to share
its life, its change, its death, and all that makes it what
it is. But alas! As yet I only know your tongue through
books. To you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak."

"But, Count," I said, "You know and speak English
thoroughly!" He bowed gravely.

"I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering
estimate, but yet I fear that I am but a little way on the
road I would travel. True, I know the grammar and the words,
but yet I know not how to speak them.

"Indeed," I said, "You speak excellently."

"Not so," he answered. "Well, I know that, did I move
and speak in your London, none there are who would not know
me for a stranger. That is not enough for me. Here I am nob-
le. I am a Boyar. The common people know me, and I am master.
But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one. Men know
him not, and to know not is to care not for. I am content
if I am like the rest, so that no man stops if he sees me,
or pauses in his speaking if he hears my words, `Ha, ha!
A stranger!' I have been so long master that I would be
master still, or at least that none other should be master
of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter
Hawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in
London. You shall, I trust, rest here with me a while, so
that by our talking I may learn the English intonation. And
I would that you tell me when I make error, even of the
smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to be away
so long today, but you will, I know forgive one who has so
many important affairs in hand."

Of course I said all I could about being willing, and
asked if I might come into that room when I chose. He ans-
wered, "Yes, certainly," and added.

"You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except
where the doors are locked, where of course you will not
wish to go. There is reason that all things are as they are,
and did you see with my eyes and know with my knowledge,
you would perhaps better understand." I said I was sure of
this, and then he went on.

"We are in Transylvania, and Transylvania is not Eng-
land. Our ways are not your ways, and there shall be to you
many strange things. Nay, from what you have told me of
your experiences already, you know something of what
strange things there may be."

This led to much conversation, and as it was evident
that he wanted to talk, if only for talking's sake, I ask-
ed him many questions regarding things that had already
happened to me or come within my notice. Sometimes he
sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by
pretending not to understand, but generally he answered
all I asked most frankly. Then as time went on, and I had
got somewhat bolder, I asked him of some of the strange
things of the preceding night, as for instance, why the
coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue
flames. He then explained to me that it was commonly
believed that on a certain night of the year, last night,
in fact, when all evil spirits are supposed to have un-
checked sway, a blue flame is seen over any place where
treasure has been concealed.

"That treasure has been hidden," he went on, "in the
region through which you came last night, there can be but
little doubt. For it was the ground fought over for centur-
ies by the Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there
is hardly a foot of soil in all this region that has not
been enriched by the blood of men, patriots or invaders.
In the old days there were stirring times, when the Aust-
rian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots
went out to meet them, men and women, the aged and the chil-
dren too, and waited their coming on the rocks above the
passes, that they might sweep destruction on them with
their artificial avalanches. When the invader was trium-
phant he found but little, for whatever there was had been
sheltered in the friendly soil."

"But how," said I, "can it have remained so long un-
discovered, when there is a sure index to it if men will
but take the trouble to look? "The Count smiled, and as his
lips ran back over his gums, the long, sharp, canine teeth
showed out strangely. He answered.

"Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool!
Those flames only appear on one night, and on that night no
man of this land will, if he can help it, stir without his
doors. And, dear sir, even if he did he would not know what
to do. Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who marked
the place of the flame would not know where to look in day-
light even for his own work. Even you would not, I dare be
sworn, be able to find these places again?"

"There you are right," I said. "I know no more than the
dead where even to look for them." Then we drifted into
other matters.

"Come," he said at last, "tell me of London and of the
house which you have procured for me." With an apology for
my remissness, I went into my own room to get the papers
from my bag. Whilst I was placing them in order I heard a
rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I
passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and
the lamp lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark.
The lamps were also lit in the study or library, and I
found the Count lying on the sofa, reading, of all things
in the world, and English Bradshaw's Guide. When I came in
he cleared the books and papers from the table, and with
him I went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts.
He was interested in everything, and asked me a myriad
questions about the place and its surroundings. He clearly
had studied beforehand all he could get on the subject of
the neighborhood, for he evidently at the end knew very
much more than I did. When I remarked this, he answered.

"Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should?
When I go there I shall be all alone, and my friend Harker
Jonathan, nay, pardon me. I fall into my country's habit of
putting your patronymic first, my friend Jonathan Harker
will not be by my side to correct and aid me. He will be
in Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the
law with my other friend, Peter Hawkins. So!"

We went thoroughly into the business of the purchase
of the estate at Purfleet. When I had told him the facts
and got his signature to the necessary papers, and had
written a letter with them ready to post to Mr. Hawkins, he
began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a place.
I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and
which I inscribe here.

"At Purfleet, on a by-road, I came across just such a
place as seemed to be required, and where was displayed a
dilapidated notice that the place was for sale. It was sur-
rounded by a high wall, of ancient structure, built of heavy
stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of
years. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all
eaten with rust.

"The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of
the old Quatre Face, as the house is four sided, agreeing
with the cardinal points of the compass. It contains in all
some twenty acres, quite surrounded by the solid stone wall
above mentioned. There are many trees on it, which make it
in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond
or small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water
is clear and flows away in a fair-sized stream. The house
is very large and of all periods back, I should say, to
mediaeval times, for one part is of stone immensely thick,
with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with
iron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old
chapel or church. I could not enter it, as I had not the
key of the door leading to it from the house, but I have
taken with my Kodak views of it from various points. The
house had been added to, but in a very straggling way, and
I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which
must be very great. There are but few houses close at
hand, one being a very large house only recently added
to and formed into a private lunatic asylum. It is not, how-
ever, visible from the grounds."

When I had finished, he said, "I am glad that it is old
and big. I myself am of an old family, and to live in a new
house would kill me. A house cannot be made habitable in a
day, and after all, how few days go to make up a century. I
rejoice also that there is a chapel of old times. We Tran-
sylvanian nobles love not to think that our bones may lie
amongst the common dead. I seek not gaiety nor mirth, not
the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and sparkling
waters which please the young and gay. I am no longer
young, and my heart, through weary years of mourning over
the dead, is attuned to mirth. Moreover, the walls of my
castle are broken. The shadows are many, and the wind
breathes cold through the broken battlements and casements.
I love the shade and the shadow, and would be alone with
my thoughts when I may." Somehow his words and his look
did not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of
face made his smile look malignant and saturnine.

Presently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to
pull my papers together. He was some little time away, and
I began to look at some of the books around me. One was an
atlas, which I found opened naturally to England, as if
that map had been much used. On looking at it I found in
certain places little rings marked, and on examining these
I noticed that one was near London on the east side, mani-
festly where his new estate was situated. The other two
were Exeter, and Whitby on the Yorkshire coast.

It was the better part of an hour when the Count re-
turned. "Aha!" he said. "Still at your books? Good! But
you must not work always. Come! I am informed that your
supper is ready." He took my arm, and we went into the next
room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table.
The Count again excused himself, as he had dined out on
his being away from home. But he sat as on the previous
night, and chatted whilst I ate. After supper I smoked,
as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with me, chat-
ting and asking questions on every conceivable subject,
hour after hour. I felt that it was getting very late in-
deed, but I did not say anything, for I felt under
obligation to meet my host's wishes in every way. I was
not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified me,
but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes
over one at the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its
way, the turn of the tide. They say that people who are
near death die generally at the change to dawn or at the
turn of the tide. Anyone who has when tired, and tied as
it were to his post, experienced this change in the
atmosphere can well believe it. All at once we heard the
crow of the cock coming up with preternatural shrillness
through the clear morning air.

Count Dracula, jumping to his feet, said, "Why there
is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay up so
long. You must make your conversation regarding my dear new
country of England less interesting, so that I may not for-
get how time flies by us," and with a courtly bow, he
quickly left me.

I went into my room and drew the curtains, but there
was little to notice. My window opened into the courtyard,
all I could see was the warm grey of quickening sky. So I
pulled the curtains again, and have written of this day.


8 May.--I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I
was getting too diffuse. But now I am glad that I went into
detail from the first, for there is something so strange
about this place and all in it that I cannot but feel uneasy.
I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had never come. It
may be that this strange night existence is telling on me,
but would that that were all! If there were any one to
talk to I could bear it, but there is no one. I have only the
Count to speak with, and he-- I fear I am myself the only
living soul within the place. Let me be prosaiac so far as
facts can be. It will help me to bear up, and imagination
must not run riot with me. If it does I am lost. Let me say
at once how I stand, or seem to.

I only slept a few hours when I went to bed,and feeling
that I could not sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shav-
ing glass by the window, and was just beginning to shave.
Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder, and heard the Count's
voice saying to me, "Good morning." I started, for it amazed
me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass
covered the whole room behind me. In starting I had cut my-
self slightly, but did not notice it at the moment. Having
answered the Count's salutation, I turned to the glass again
to see how I had been mistaken. This time there could be no
error, for the man was close to me, and I could see him
over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of him in the
mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed, but there
was no sign of a man in it, except myself.

This was startling, and coming on the top of so many
strange things, was beginning to increase that vague feeling
of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near.
But at the instant I saw the the cut had bled a little, and
the blood was trickling over my chin. I laid down the razor,
turning as I did so half round to look for some sticking
plaster. When the Count saw my face, his eyes blazed with a
sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at my
throat. I drew away and his hand touched the string of
beads which held the crucifix. It made an instant change
in him, for the fury passed so quickly that I could hardly
believe that it was ever there.

"Take care," he said, "take care how you cut yourself.
It is more dangerous that you think in this country." Then
seizing the shaving glass, he went on, "And this is the
wretched thing that has done the mischief. It is a foul
bauble of man's vanity. Away with it!" And opening the
window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung out
the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on
the stones of the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew
without a word. It is very annoying, for I do not see how
I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or the bottom of
the shaving pot, which is fortunately of metal.

When I went into the dining room, breakfast was pre-
pared, but I could not find the Count anywhere. So I break-
fasted alone. It is strange that as yet I have not seen the
Count eat or drink. He must be a very peculiar man! After
breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I went out
on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South.

The view was magnificent, and from where I stood there
was every opportunity of seeing it. The castle is on the
very edge of a terrific precipice. A stone falling from the
window would fall a thousand feet without touching anything!
As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree tops, with
occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm. Here and
there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep
gorges through the forests.

But I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had
seen the view I explored further. Doors, doors, doors every-
where, and all locked and bolted. In no place save from the
windows in the castle walls is there an available exit. The
castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!




CHAPTER 3


Jonathan Harker's Journal Continued


When I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feel-
ing came over me. I rushed up and down the stairs, trying
every door and peering out of every window I could find, but
after a little the conviction of my helplessness overpowered
all other feelings. When I look back after a few hours I
think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much
as a rat does in a trap. When, however, the conviction had
come to me that I was helpless I sat down quietly, as quiet-
ly as I have ever done anything in my life, and began to
think over what was best to be done. I am thinking still,
and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of one thing
only am I certain. That it is no use making my ideas known
to the Count. He knows well that I am imprisoned, and as he
has done it himself, and has doubtless his own motives for
it, he would only deceive me if I trusted him fully with the
facts. So far as I can see, my only plan will be to keep my
knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes open. I am, I
know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears,
or else I am in desperate straits, and if the latter be so,
I need, and shall need, all my brains to get through.

I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the
great door below shut, and knew that the Count had returned.
He did not come at once into the library, so I went cau-
tiously to my own room and found him making the bed. This
was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along thought,
that there are no servants in the house. When later I saw
him through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the
table in the dining room, I was assured of it. For if he
does himself all these menial offices, surely it is proof
that there is no one else in the castle, it must have been
the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that
brought me here. This is a terrible thought, for if so,
what does it mean that he could control the wolves, as he
did, by only holding up his hand for silence? How was it
that all the people at Bistritz and on the coach had some
terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the crucifix,
of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash?

Bless that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round
my neck! For it is a comfort and a strength to me whenever I
touch it. It is odd that a thing which I have been taught to
regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time of
loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that there is some-
thing in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a
medium, a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy
and comfort? Some time, if it may be, I must examine this
matter and try to make up my mind about it. In the meantime
I must find out all I can about Count Dracula,as it may help
me to understand. Tonight he may talk of himself, if I turn
the conversation that way. I must be very careful, however,
not to awake his suspicion.


Midnight.--I have had a long talk with the Count. I
asked him a few questions on Transylvania history, and he
warmed up to the subject wonderfully. In his speaking of
things and people, and especially of battles, he spoke as if
he had been present at them all. This he afterwards explained
by saying that to a Boyar the pride of his house and name is
his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their fate
is his fate. Whenever he spoke of his house he always said
"we", and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking.
I wish I could put down all he said exactly as he said it,
for to me it was most fascinating. It seemed to have in it
a whole history of the country. He grew excited as he spoke,
and walked about the room pulling his great white moustache
and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as though
he would crush it by main strength. One thing he said which
I shall put down as nearly as I can, for it tells in its way
the story of his race.

"We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins
flows the blood of many brave races who fought as the lion
fights, for lordship. Here, in the whirlpool of European
races, the Ugric tribe bore down from Iceland the fighting
spirit which Thor and Wodin game them, which their Berserkers
displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe,
aye, and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought
that the werewolves themselves had come. Here, too, when
they came, they found the Huns, whose warlike fury had
swept the earth like a living flame, till the dying peoples
held that in their veins ran the blood of those old witches,
who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the
desert. Fools, fools! What devil or what witch was ever so
great as Attila, whose blood is in these veins?" He held up
his arms. "Is it a wonder that we were a conquering race,
that we were proud, that when the Magyar, the Lombard, the
Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured his thousands on our
frontiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that when Arpad
and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he
found us here when he reached the frontier, that the Honfog-
lalas was completed there? And when the Hungarian flood swept
eastward, the Szekelys were claimed as kindred by the victor-
ious Magyars, and to us for centuries was trusted the guard-
ing of the frontier of Turkeyland. Aye, and more than that,
endless duty of the frontier guard, for as the Turks say,
`water sleeps, and the enemy is sleepless.' Who more gladly
than we throughout the Four Nations received the `bloody
sword,' or at its warlike call flocked quicker to the stand-
ard of the King? When was redeemed that great shame of my
nation, the shame of Cassova, when the flags of the Wallach
and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent? Who was it but
one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and
beat the Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed!
Woe was it that his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen,
sold his people to the Turk and brought the shame of slavery
on them! Was it not this Dracula, indeed, who inspired that
other of his race who in a later age again and again brought
his forces over the great river into Turkeyland, who, when he
was beaten back, came again, and again, though he had to come
alone from the bloody field where his troops were being
slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately
triumph! They said that he thought only of himself.  Bah! What
good are peasants without a leader? Where ends the war with-
out a brain and heart to conduct it? Again, when, after the
battle of Mohacs, we threw off the Hungarian yoke, we of the
Dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for our spirit
would not brook that we were not free. Ah, young sir, the
Szekelys, and the Dracula as their heart's blood, their
brains, and their swords, can boast a record that mushroom
growths like the Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach.
The warlike days are over. Blood is too precious a thing in
these days of dishonourable peace, and the glories of the
great races are as a tale that is told."

It was by this time close on morning, and we went to
bed. (Mem., this diary seems horribly like the beginning of
the "Arabian Nights," for everything has to break off at
cockcrow, or like the ghost of Hamlet's father.)


12 May.--Let me begin with facts, bare, meager facts,
verified by books and figures, and of which there can be no
doubt. I must not confuse them with experiences which will
have to rest on my own observation, or my memory of them.
Last evening when the Count came from his room he began by
asking me questions on legal matters and on the doing of
certain kinds of business. I had spent the day wearily over
books, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some
of the matters I had been examined in at Lincoln's Inn. There
was a certain method in the Count's inquiries, so I shall
try to put them down in sequence. The knowledge may somehow
or some time be useful to me.

First, he asked if a man in England might have two so-
licitors or more. I told him he might have a dozen if he
wished, but that it would not be wise to have more than one
solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only one could act
at a time, and that to change would be certain to militate
against his interest. He seemed thoroughly to understand,
and went on to ask if there would be any practical difficul-
ty in having one man to attend, say, to banking, and another
to look after shipping, in case local help were needed in a
place far from the home of the banking solicitor. I asked
to explain more fully, so that I might not by any chance
mislead him, so he said,

"I shall illustrate. Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter
Hawkins, from under the shadow of your beautiful cathedral
at Exeter, which is far from London, buys for me through
your good self my place at London. Good! Now here let me
say frankly, lest you should think it strange that I have
sought the services of one so far off from London instead of
some one resident there, that my motive was that no local
interest might be served save my wish only, and as one of
London residence might, perhaps, have some purpose of himself
or friend to serve, I went thus afield to seek my agent,
whose labours should be only to my interest. Now, suppose I,
who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to New-
castle, or Durham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that
it could with more ease be done by consigning to one in
these ports?"

I answered that certainly it would be most easy, but
that we solicitors had a system of agency one for the other,
so that local work could be done locally on instruction from
any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing himself
in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out
by him without further trouble.

"But," said he, "I could be at liberty to direct myself.
Is it not so?"

"Of course, " I replied, and "Such is often done by men
of business, who do not like the whole of their affairs to be
known by any one person."

"Good!" he said,and then went on to ask about the means
of making consignments and the forms to be gone through, and
of all sorts of difficulties which might arise, but by fore-
thought could be guarded against. I explained all these
things to him to the best of my ability, and he certainly
left me under the impression that he would have made a
wonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not
think of or foresee. For a man who was never in the country,
and who did not evidently do much in the way of business, his
knowledge and acumen were wonderful. When he had satisfied
himself on these points of which he had spoken, and I had
verified all as well as I could by the books available, he
suddenly stood up and said, "Have you written since your
first letter to our friend Mr. Peter Hawkins, or to any
other?"

It was with some bitterness in my heart that I answered
that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity
of sending letters to anybody.

"Then write now, my young friend," he said, laying a
heavy hand on my shoulder, "write to our friend and to any
other, and say, if it will please you, that you shall stay
with me until a month from now."

"Do you wish me to stay so long?" I asked, for my heart
grew cold at the thought.

"I desire it much, nay I will take no refusal. When your
master, employer, what you will, engaged that someone should
come on his behalf, it was understood that my needs only were
to be consulted. I have not stinted. Is it not so?"

What could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr. Hawkins'
interest, not mine, and I had to think of him, not myself,
and besides, while Count Dracula was speaking, there was
that in his eyes and in his bearing which made me remember
that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I could have
no choice. The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his mas-
tery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use
them, but in his own smooth, resistless way.

"I pray you, my good young friend, that you will not
discourse of things other than business in your letters. It
will doubtless please your friends to know that you are well,
and that you look forward to getting home to them. Is it not
so?" As he spoke he handed me three sheets of note paper
and three envelopes. They were all of the thinnest foreign
post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his
quiet smile, with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red
underlip, I understood as well as if he had spoken that I
should be more careful what I wrote, for he would be able to
read it. So I determined to write only formal notes now, but
to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina,
for to her I could write shorthand, which would puzzle the
Count, if he did see it. When I had written my two letters I
sat quiet, reading a book whilst the Count wrote several
notes, referring as he wrote them to some books on his table.
Then he took up my two and placed them with his own, and put
by his writing materials, after which, the instant the door
had closed behind him, I leaned over and looked at the lett-
ers, which were face down on the table. I felt no compunction
in doing so for under the circumstances I felt that I should
protect myself in every way I could.

One of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington,
No. 7, The Crescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna.
The third was to Coutts & Co., London, and the fourth to
Herren Klopstock & Billreuth, bankers, Buda Pesth. The
second and fourth were unsealed. I was just about to look at
them when I saw the door handle move. I sank back in my seat,
having just had time to resume my book before the Count,
holding still another letter in his hand, entered the room.
He took up the letters on the table and stamped them care-
fully, and then turning to me, said,

"I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to
do in private this evening. You will, I hope, find all things
as you wish." At the door he turned, and after a moment's
pause said, "Let me advise you, my dear young friend. Nay,
let me warn you with all seriousness, that should you leave
these rooms you will not by any chance go to sleep in any
other part of the castle. It is old, and has many memories,
and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely. Be
warned! Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to
do, then haste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for
your rest will then be safe. But if you be not careful in
this respect, then," He finished his speech in a gruesome
way, for he motioned with his hands as if he were washing
them. I quite understood. My only doubt was as to whether
any dream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible
net of gloom and mystery which seemed closing around me.


Later.--I endorse the last words written, but this time
there is no doubt in question. I shall not fear to sleep in
any place where he is not. I have placed the crucifix over
the head of my bed, I imagine that my rest is thus freer from
dreams, and there it shall remain.

When he left me I went to my room. After a little while,
not hearing any sound, I came out and went up the stone stair
to where I could look out towards the South. There was some
sense of freedom in the vast expanse, inaccessible though it
was to me,as compared with the narrow darkness of the court-
yard. Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in pri-
son, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it
were of the night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal ex-
istence tell on me. It is destroying my nerve. I start at
my own shadow, and am full of all sorts of horrible imagin-
ings. God knows that there is ground for my terrible fear in
this accursed place! I looked out over the beautiful expanse,
bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light
as day. In the soft light the distant hills became melted,
and the shadows in the valleys and gorges of velvety black-
ness. The mere beauty seemed to cheer me. There was peace
and comfort in every breath I drew. As I leaned from the win-
dow my eye was caught by something moving a storey below me,
and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of
the rooms, that the windows of the Count's own room would
look out. The window at which I stood was tall and deep,
stone-mullioned, and though weatherworn, was still complete.
But it was evidently many a day since the case had been
there. I drew back behind the stonework, and looked carefully
out.

What I saw was the Count's head coming out from the
window. I did not see the face, but I knew the man by the
neck and the movement of his back and arms. In any case I
could not mistake the hands which I had had some many oppor-
tunities of studying. I was at first interested and somewhat
amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest
and amuse a man when he is a prisoner. But my very feelings
changed to repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man
slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the
castle wall over the dreadful abyss, face down with his cloak
spreading out around him like great wings. At first I could
not believe my eyes. I thought it was some trick of the moon-
light, some weird effect of shadow, but I kept looking, and
it could be no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the
corners of the stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress
of years, and by thus using every projection and inequality
move downwards with considerable speed, just as a lizard
moves along a wall.

What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature,
is it in the semblance of man? I feel the dread of this hor-
rible place overpowering me. I am in fear, in awful fear, and
there is no escape for me. I am encompassed about with
terrors that I dare not think of.


15 May.--Once more I have seen the count go out in his
lizard fashion. He moved downwards in a sidelong way, some
hundred feet down, and a good deal to the left. He vanished
into some hole or window. When his head had disappeared, I
leaned out to try and see more, but without avail. The dis-
tance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. I knew
he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportun-
ity to explore more than I had dared to do as yet. I went
back to the room, and taking a lamp, tried all the doors.
They were all locked, as I had expected, and the locks were
comparatively new. But I went down the stone stairs to the
hall where I had entered originally. I found I could pull
back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains.
But the door was locked, and the key was gone! That key must
be in the Count's room. I must watch should his door be un-
locked, so that I may get it and escape. I went on to make
a thorough examination of the various stairs and passages,
and to try the doors that opened from them. One or two
small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing
to see in them except old furniture, dusty with age and
moth-eaten. At last, however, I found one door at the top of
the stairway which, though it seemed locked, gave a little
under pressure. I tried it harder, and found that it was not
really locked, but that the resistance came from the fact
that the hinges had fallen somewhat,and the heavy door rest-
ed on the floor. Here was an opportunity which I might not
have again, so I exerted myself,and with many efforts forced
it back so that I could enter. I was now in a wing of the
castle further to the right than the rooms I knew and a
storey lower down. From the windows I could see that the
suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the win-
dows of the end room looking out both west and south. On the
latter side, as well as to the former, there was a great
precipice. The castle was built on the corner of a great
rock, so that on three sides it was quite impregnable, and
great windows were placed here where sling, or bow, or culv-
erin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort,
impossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secu-
red. To the west was a great valley, and then, rising far
away, great jagged mountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak,
the sheer rock studded with mountain ash and thorn, whose
roots clung in cracks and crevices and crannies of the stone.
This was evidently the portion of the castle occupied by the
ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more an air of
comfort than any I had seen.

The windows were curtainless, and the yellow moonlight,
flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to see
even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay
over all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time
and moth. My lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brill-
iant moonlight, but I was glad to have it with me, for there
was a dread loneliness in the place which chilled my heart
and made my nerves tremble. Still, it was better than living
alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the pre-
sence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my
nerves, I found a soft quietude come over me. Here I am,
sitting at a little oak table where in old times possibly
some fair lady sat to pen, with much thought and many blushes,
her ill-spelt love letter, and writing in my diary in short-
hand all that has happened since I closed it last. It is the
nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, un-
less my senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have,
powers of their own which mere "modernity" cannot kill.


Later: The morning of 16 May.--God preserve my sanity,
for to this I am reduced. Safety and the assurance of safety
are things of the past. Whilst I live on here there is but
one thing to hope for, that I may not go mad, if, indeed, I
be not mad already. If I be sane, then surely it is maddening
to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this hate-
ful place the Count is the least dreadful to me, that to him
alone I can look for safety, even though this be only whilst
I can serve his purpose. Great God! Merciful God, let me be
calm, for out of that way lies madness indeed. I begin to
get new lights on certain things which have puzzled me. Up
to now I never quite knew what Shakespeare meant when he
made Hamlet say, "My tablets! Quick, my tablets! `tis meet
that I put it down," etc., For now, feeling as though my own
brain were unhinged or as if the shock had come which must
end in its undoing, I turn to my diary for repose. The habit
of entering accurately must help to soothe me.

The Count's mysterious warning frightened me at the
time. It frightens me more not when I think of it, for in
the future he has a fearful hold upon me. I shall fear to
doubt what he may say!

When I had written in my diary and had fortunately re-
placed the book and pen in my pocket I felt sleepy. The
Count's warning came into my mind, but I took pleasure in
disobeying it. The sense of sleep was upon me, and with it
the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. The soft moon-
light soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of
freedom which refreshed me. I determined not to return to-
night to the gloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where,
of old, ladies had sat and sung and lived sweet lives whilst
their gentle breasts were sad for their menfolk away in the
midst of remorseless wars. I drew a great couch out of its
place near the corner, so that as I lay, I could look at the
lovely view to east and south,and unthinking of and uncaring
for the dust, composed myself for sleep. I suppose I must
have fallen asleep. I hope so, but I fear, for all that fol-
lowed was startlingly real, so real that now sitting here in
the broad, full sunlight of the morning, I cannot in the
least believe that it was all sleep.

I was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any
way since I came into it. I could see along the floor, in the
brilliant moonlight, my own footsteps marked where I had dis-
turbed the long accumulation of dust. In the moonlight opp-
osite me were three young women, ladies by their dress and
manner. I thought at the time that I must be dreaming when I
saw them, they threw no shadow on the floor. They came close
to me, and looked at me for some time, and then whispered
together. Two were dark, and had high aquiline noses, like
the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes, that seemed to be
almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The
other was fair,as fair as can be, with great masses of gold-
en hair and eyes like pale sapphires. I seemed somehow to
know her face, and to know it in connection with some dreamy
fear, but I could not recollect at the moment how or where.
All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like pearls
against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. There was some-
thing about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the
same time some deadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burn-
ing desire that they would kiss me with those red lips. It is
not good to note this down, lest some day it should meet
Mina's eyes and cause her pain, but it is the truth. They
whispered together, and then they all three laughed, such a
silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never
could have come through the softness of human lips. It was
like the intolerable, tingling sweetness of waterglasses when
played on by a cunning hand. The fair girl shook her head
coquettishly, and the other two urged her on.

One said, "Go on! You are first, and we shall follow.
Yours' is the right to begin."

The other added, "He is young and strong. There are
kisses for us all."

I lay quiet, looking out from under my eyelashes in an
agony of delightful anticipation. The fair girl advanced and
bent over me till I could feel the movement of her breath
upon me. Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent the
same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a
bitter underlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one
smells in blood.

I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw
perfectly under the lashes. The girl went on her knees, and
bent over me, simply gloating. There was a deliberate volupt-
uousness which was both thrilling and repulsive, and as she
arched her neck she actually licked her lips like an animal,
till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining on
the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the
white sharp teeth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips
went below the range of my mouth and chin and seemed to
fasten on my throat. Then she paused, and I could hear the
churning sound of her tongue as it licked her teeth and lips,
and I could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then the skin of
my throat began to tingle as one's flesh does when the hand
that is to tickle it approaches nearer, nearer. I could feel
the soft, shivering touch of the lips on the super sensitive
skin of my throat, and the hard dents of two sharp teeth,
just touching and pausing there. I closed my eyes in lang-
uorous ecstasy and waited, waited with beating heart.

But at that instant, another sensation swept through me
as quick as lightning. I was conscious of the presence of the
Count, and of his being as if lapped in a storm of fury. As
my eyes opened involuntarily I saw his strong hand grasp the
slender neck of the fair woman and with giant's power draw
it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the white
teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red
with passion. But the Count! Never did I imagine such wrath
and fury, even to the demons of the pit. His eyes were pos-
itively blazing. The red light in them was lurid, as if the
flames of hell fire blazed behind them. His face was deathly
pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires. The
thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a
heaving bar of white-hot metal. With a fierce sweep of his
arm, he hurled the woman from him, and then motioned to the
others, as though he were beating them back. It was the same
imperious gesture that I had seen used to the wolves. In a
voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to cut
through the air and then ring in the room he said,

"How dare you touch him, any of you? How dare you cast
eyes on him when I had forbidden it? Back, I tell you all!
This man belongs to me! Beware how you meddle with him, or
you'll have to deal with me."

The fair girl, with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned
to answer him. "You yourself never loved. You never love!" On
this the other women joined,and such a mirthless, hard, soul-
less laughter rang through the room that it almost made me
faint to hear. It seemed like the pleasure of fiends.

Then the Count turned, after looking at my face atten-
tively, and said in a soft whisper, "Yes, I too can love. You
yourselves can tell it from the past. Is it not so? Well, now
I promise you that when I am done with him you shall kiss
him at your will. Now go! Go! I must awaken him, for there is
work to be done."

"Are we to have nothing tonight?" said one of them, with
a low laugh, as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown
upon the floor, and which moved as though there were some
living thing within it. For answer he nodded his head. One
of the women jumped forward and opened it. If my ears did not
deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a half
smothered child. The women closed round, whilst I was aghast
with horror. But as I looked, they disappeared, and with them
the dreadful bag. There was no door near them, and they could
not have passed me without my noticing. They simply seemed to
fade into the rays of the moonlight and pass out through the
window, for I could see outside the dim, shadowy forms for a
moment before they entirely faded away.

Then the horror overcame me,and I sank down unconscious.





CHAPTER 4


Jonathan Harker's Journal Continued


I awoke in my own bed. If it be that I had not dreamt,
the Count must have carried me here. I tried to satisfy
myself on the subject, but could not arrive at any un-
questionable result. To be sure, there were certain small
evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by
in a manner which was not my habit. My watch was still
unwound, and I am rigorously accustomed to wind it the last
thing before going to bed, and many such details. But these
things are no proof, for they may have been evidences that
my mind was not as usual, and, for some cause or another, I
had certainly been much upset. I must watch for proof. Of one
thing I am glad. If it was that the Count carried me here and
undressed me, he must have been hurried in his task, for my
pockets are intact. I am sure this diary would have been a
mystery to him which he would not have brooked. He would have
taken or destroyed it. As I look round this room, although
it has been to me so full of fear, it is now a sort of sanc-
tuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful
women, who were, who are, waiting to suck my blood.


18 May.--I have been down to look at that room again in
daylight, for I must know the truth. When I got to the door-
way at the top of the stairs I found it closed. It had been
so forcibly driven against the jamb that part of the wood-
work was splintered. I could see that the bolt of the lock
had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside.
I fear it was no dream, and must act on this surmise.


19 May.--I am surely in the toils. Last night the Count
asked me in the sauvest tones to write three letters, one
saying that my work here was nearly done, and that I should
start for home within a few days,another that I was starting
on the next morning from the time of the letter, and the
third that I had left the castle and arrived at Bistritz. I
would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state
of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the
Count whilst I am so absolutely in his power. And to refuse
would be to excite his suspicion and to arouse his anger. He
knows that I know too much, and that I must not live, lest I
be dangerous to him. My only chance is to prolong my oppor-
tunities. Something may occur which will give ma a chance to
escape. I saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath
which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him.
He explained to me that posts were few and uncertain, and
that my writing now would ensure ease of mind to my friends.
And he assured me with so much impressiveness that he would
countermand the later letters, which would be held over at
Bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my
prolonging my stay, that to oppose him would have been to
create new suspicion. I therefore pretended to fall in with
his views, and asked him what dates I should put on the
letters.

He calculated a minute, and then said, "The first
should be June 12, the second June 19,and the third June 29."

I know now the span of my life. God help me!


28 May.--There is a chance of escape, or at any rate of
being able to send word home. A band of Szgany have come to
the castle, and are encamped in the courtyard. These are
gipsies. I have notes of them in my book. They are peculiar
to this part of the world, though allied to the ordinary
gipsies all the world over. There are thousands of them in
Hungary and Transylvania, who are almost outside all law.
They attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or
boyar, and call themselves by his name. They are fearless
and without religion, save superstition, and they talk only
their own varieties of the Romany tongue.

I shall write some letters home, and shall try to get
them to have them posted. I have already spoken to them
through my window to begin acquaintanceship. They took their
hats off and made obeisance and many signs, which however, I
could not understand any more than I could their spoken
language. . .

I have written the letters. Mina's is in shorthand, and
I simply ask Mr. Hawkins to communicate with her. To her I
have explained my situation, but without the horrors which I
may only surmise. It would shock and frighten her to death
were I to expose my heart to her. Should the letters not
carry, then the Count shall not yet know my secret or the
extent of my knowledge. . .


I have given the letters. I threw them through the bars
of my window with a gold piece, and made what signs I could
to have them posted. The man who took them pressed them to
his heart and bowed, and then put them in his cap. I could
do no more. I stole back to the study, and began to read. As
the Count did not come in, I have written here. . .


The Count has come. He sat down beside me, and said in
his smoothest voice as he opened two letters, "The Szgany
has given me these, of which, though I know not whence they
come, I shall, of course, take care. See!"--He must have
looked at it.--"One is from you, and to my friend Peter
Hawkins. The other,"--here he caught sight of the strange
symbols as he opened the envelope, and the dark look came
into his face, and his eyes blazed wickedly,--"The other is
a vile thing, an outrage upon friendship and hospitality! It
is not signed. Well! So it cannot matter to us."And he calm-
ly held letter and envelope in the flame of the lamp till
they were consumed.

Then he went on, "The letter to Hawkins, that I shall,
of course send on, since it is yours. Your letters are sacred
to me. Your pardon, my friend, that unknowingly I did break
the seal. Will you not cover it again?" He held out the letter
to me, and with a courteous bow handed me a clean envelope.

I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence.
When he went out of the room I could hear the key turn soft-
ly. A minute later I went over and tried it, and the door
was locked.

When, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into
the room, his coming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on
the sofa. He was very courteous and very cheery in his manner,
and seeing that I had been sleeping, he said, "So, my friend,
you are tired? Get to bed. There is the surest rest. I may
not have the pleasure of talk tonight, since there are many
labours to me, but you will sleep, I pray."

I passed to my room and went to bed, and, strange to
say, slept without dreaming. Despair has its own calms.

31 May.--This morning when I woke I thought I would
provide myself with some papers and envelopes from my bag
and keep them in my pocket, so that I might write in case I
should get an opportunity, but again a surprise, again a
shock!

Every scrap of paper was gone, and with it all my notes,
my memoranda, relating to railways and travel, my letter of
credit, in fact all that might be useful to me were I once
outside the castle. I sat and pondered awhile, and then some
thought occurred to me, and I made search of my portmanteau
and in the wardrobe where I had placed my clothes.

The suit in which I had travelled was gone, and also my
overcoat and rug. I could find no trace of them anywhere.
This looked like some new scheme of villainy. . .


17 June.--This morning, as I was sitting on the edge of
my bed cudgelling my brains, I heard without a crackling of
whips and pounding and scraping of horses' feet up the
rocky path beyond the courtyard. With joy I hurried to the
window, and saw drive into the yard two great leiter-wagons,
each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of each
pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great nail-studded belt,
dirty sheepskin, and high boots. They had also their long
staves in hand. I ran to the door, intending to descend and
try and join them through the main hall, as I thought that
way might be opened for them. Again a shock, my door was
fastened on the outside.

Then I ran to the window and cried to them. They looked
up at me stupidly and pointed, but just then the "hetman" of
the Szgany came out, and seeing them pointing to my window,
said something, at which they laughed.

Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonized
entreaty, would make them even look at me. They resolutely
turned away. The leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes,
with handles of thick rope. These were evidently empty by
the ease with which the Slovaks handled them, and by their
resonance as they were roughly moved.

When they were all unloaded and packed in a great heap
in one corner of the yard, the Slovaks were given some money
by the Szgany, and spitting on it for luck, lazily went each
to his horse's head. Shortly afterwards, I heard the crack-
ling of their whips die away in the distance.


24 June.--Last night the Count left me early, and lock-
ed himself into his own room.  As soon as I dared I ran up the
winding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened
South. I thought I would watch for the Count, for there is
something going on. The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the
castle and are doing work of some kind. I know it, for now
and then, I hear a far-away muffled sound as of mattock and
spade, and, whatever it is, it must be the end of some ruth-
less villainy.

I had been at the window somewhat less than half an
hour, when I saw something coming out of the Count's window.
I drew back and watched carefully, and saw the whole man
emerge. It was a new shock to me to find that he had on the
suit of clothes which I had worn whilst travelling here, and
slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I had seen
the women take away. There could be no doubt as to his quest,
and in my garb, too! This, then, is his new scheme of evil,
that he will allow others to see me, as they think, so that
he may both leave evidence that I have been seen in the
towns or villages posting my own letters, and that any
wickedness which he may do shall by the local people be
attributed to me.

It makes me rage to think that this can go on, and
whilst I am shut up here, a veritable prisoner, but without
that protection of the law which is even a criminal's right
and consolation.

I thought I would watch for the Count's return, and for
a long time sat doggedly at the window. Then I began to not-
ice that there were some quaint little specks floating in
the rays of the moonlight. They were like the tiniest grains
of dust,and they whirled round and gathered in clusters in a
nebulous sort of way. I watched them with a sense of soothing,
and a sort of calm stole over me. I leaned back in the embra-
sure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy
more fully the aerial gambolling.

Something made me start up, a low, piteous howling of
dogs somewhere far below in the valley, which was hidden
from my sight. Louder it seemed to ring in my ears, and the
floating moats of dust to take new shapes to the sound as
they danced in the moonlight. I felt myself struggling to
awake to some call of my instincts. Nay, my very soul was
struggling, and my half-remembered sensibilities were striv-
ing to answer the call. I was becoming hypnotised!

Quicker and quicker danced the dust. The moonbeams seem-
ed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom
beyond. More and more they gathered till they seemed to take
dim phantom shapes. And then I started, broad awake and in
full possession of my senses, and ran screaming from the
place.

The phantom shapes, which were becoming gradually mat-
erialised from the moonbeams, were those three ghostly women
to whom I was doomed.

I fled, and felt somewhat safer in my own room, where
there was no moonlight, and where the lamp was burning
brightly.

When a couple of hours had passed I heard something
stirring in the Count's room, something like a sharp wail
quickly suppressed. And then there was silence, deep, awful
silence, which chilled me. With a beating heart, I tried the
door, but I was locked in my prison, and could do nothing. I
sat down and simply cried.

As I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without, the
agonised cry of a woman. I rushed to the window, and throw-
ing it up, peered between the bars.

There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, hold-
ing her hands over her heart as one distressed with running.
She was leaning against the corner of the gateway. When she
saw my face at the window she threw herself forward, and
shouted in a voice laden with menace, "Monster, give me my
child!"

She threw herself on her knees,and raising up her hands,
cried the same words in tones which wrung my heart. Then she
tore her hair and beat her breast, and abandoned herself to
all the violences of extravagant emotion. Finally, she threw
herself forward, and though I could not see her, I could hear
the beating of her naked hands against the door.

Somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard
the voice of the Count calling in his harsh, metallic whisper.
His call seemed to be answered from far and wide by the howl-
ing of wolves. Before many minutes had passed a pack of them
poured, like a pent-up dam when liberated, through the wide
entrance into the courtyard.

There was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the
wolves was but short. Before long they streamed away singly,
licking their lips.

I could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of
her child, and she was better dead.

What shall I do? What can I do? How can I escape from
this dreadful thing of night, gloom, and fear?


25 June.--No man knows till he has suffered from the
night how sweet and dear to his heart and eye the morning
can be. When the sun grew so high this morning that it
struck the top of the great gateway opposite my window, the
high spot which it touched seemed to me as if the dove from
the ark had lighted there. My fear fell from me as if it
had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth.

I must take action of some sort whilst the courage of
the day is upon me. Last night one of my post-dated letters
went to post, the first of that fatal series which is to
blot out the very traces of my existence from the earth.

Let me not think of it. Action!

It has always been at night-time that I have been mo-
lested or threatened, or in some way in danger or in fear.
I have not yet seen the Count in the daylight. Can it be
that he sleeps when others wake, that he may be awake whilst
they sleep? If I could only get into his room! But there is
no possible way. The door is always locked, no way for me.

Yes, there is a way, if one dares to take it. Where his
body has gone why may not another body go? I have seen him
myself crawl from his window. Why should not I imitate him,
and go in by his window? The chances are desperate, but my
need is more desperate still. I shall risk it. At the worst
it can only be death, and a man's death is not a calf's, and
the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me. God help me
in my task! Goodbye, Mina, if I fail. Goodbye, my faithful
friend and second father. Goodbye, all, and last of all Mina!


Same day, later.--I have made the effort, and God help-
ing me, have come safely back to this room. I must put down
every detail in order. I went whilst my courage was fresh
straight to the window on the south side, and at once got
outside on this side. The stones are big and roughly cut, and
the mortar has by process of time been washed away between
them. I took off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate
way. I looked down once, so as to make sure that a sudden
glimpse of the awful depth would not overcome me, but after
that kept my eyes away from it. I know pretty well the direc-
tion and distance of the Count's window, and made for it as
well as I could, having regard to the opportunities available.
I did not feel dizzy, I suppose I was too excited, and the
time seemed ridiculously short till I found myself standing
on the window sill and trying to raise up the sash. I was
filled with agitation, however, when I bent down and slid
feet foremost in through the window. Then I looked around for
the Count, but with surprise and gladness, made a discovery.
The room was empty! It was barely furnished with odd things,
which seemed to have never been used.

The furniture was something the same style as that in
the south rooms, and was covered with dust. I looked for the
key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it any-
where. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in
one corner, gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Aust-
rian,and Hungarian,and Greek and Turkish money, covered with
a film of dust, as though it had lain long in the ground.
None of it that I noticed was less than three hundred years
old. There were also chains and ornaments, some jewelled, but
all of them old and stained.

At one corner of the room was a heavy door. I tried it,
for, since I could not find the key of the room or the key
of the outer door, which was the main object of my search, I
must make further examination, or all my efforts would be
in vain. It was open, and led through a stone passage to a
circular stairway, which went steeply down.

I descended, minding carefully where I went for the
stairs were dark, being only lit by loopholes in the heavy
masonry. At the bottom there was a dark, tunnel-like pass-
age, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the odour
of old earth newly turned. As I went through the passage
the smell grew closer and heavier. At last I pulled open
a heavy door which stood ajar, and found myself in an old
ruined chapel, which had evidently been used as a graveyard.
The roof was broken, and in two places were steps leading to
vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and the
earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which
had been brought by the Slovaks.

There was nobody about, and I made a search over every
inch of the ground, so as not to lose a chance. I went down
even into the vaults, where the dim light struggled,although
to do so was a dread to my very soul. Into two of these I
went, but saw nothing except fragments of old coffins and
piles of dust. In the third, however, I made a discovery.

There, in one of the great boxes, of which there were
fifty in all, on a pile of newly dug earth, lay the Count!
He was either dead or asleep. I could not say which, for eyes
were open and stony, but without the glassiness of death,and
the cheeks had the warmth of life through all their pallor.
The lips were as red as ever. But there was no sign of move-
ment, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart.

I bent over him, and tried to find any sign of life,
but in vain. He could not have lain there long, for the
earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours. By the
side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and
there. I thought he might have the keys on him, but when I
went to search I saw the dead eyes, and in them dead though
they were, such a look of hate, though unconscious of me or
my presence, that I fled from the place, and leaving the
Count's room by the window, crawled again up the castle wall.
Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed and
tried to think.


29 June.--Today is the date of my last letter, and the
Count has taken steps to prove that it was genuine, for again
I saw him leave the castle by the same window, and in my
clothes. As he went down the wall, lizard fashion, I wished
I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might destroy him.
But I fear that no weapon wrought along by man's hand would
have any effect on him. I dared not wait to see him return,
for I feared to see those weird sisters. I came back to the
library, and read there till I fell asleep.

I was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly
as a man could look as he said, "Tomorrow, my friend, we must
part. You return to your beautiful England, I to some work
which may have such an end that we may never meet. Your lett-
er home has been despatched. Tomorrow I shall not be here,
but all shall be ready for your journey. In the morning come
the Szgany, who have some labours of their own here, and al-
so come some Slovaks. When they have gone, my carriage
shall come for you, and shall bear you to the Borgo Pass to
meet the diligence from Bukovina to Bistritz. But I am in
hopes that I shall see more of you at Castle Dracula."

I suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity.
Sincerity! It seems like a profanation of the word to write
it in connection with such a monster, so I asked him point-
blank, "Why may I not go tonight?"

"Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on
a mission."

"But I would walk with pleasure. I want to get away at
once."

He smiled, such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I
knew there was some trick behind his smoothness. He said,
"And your baggage?"

"I do not care about it. I can send for it some other
time."

The Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy
which made me rub my eyes, it seemed so real, "You English
have a saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit is
that which rules our boyars, `Welcome the coming, speed the
parting guest.' Come with me, my dear young friend. Not an
hour shall you wait in my house against your will, though sad
am I at your going,and that you so suddenly desire it. Come!"
With a stately gravity, he, with the lamp, preceded me down
the stairs and along the hall. Suddenly he stopped. "Hark!"

Close at hand came the howling of many wolves. It was
almost as if the sound sprang up at the rising of his hand,
just as the music of a great orchestra seems to leap under
the baton of the conductor. After a pause of a moment, he
proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew back the
ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to
draw it open.

To my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked.
Suspiciously, I looked all round, but could see no key of
any kind.

As the door began to open, the howling of the wolves
without grew louder and angrier. Their red jaws, with champ-
ing teeth, and their blunt-clawed feet as they leaped, came
in through the opening door. I knew than that to struggle
at the moment against the Count was useless. With such allies
as these at his command, I could do nothing.

But still the door continued slowly to open, and only
the Count's body stood in the gap. Suddenly it struck me
that this might be the moment and means of my doom. I was to
be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation. There was
a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the
Count, and as the last chance I cried out, "Shut the door! I
shall wait till morning." And I covered my face with my
hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment.

With one sweep of his powerful arm, the Count threw the
door shut, and the great bolts clanged and echoed through
the hall as they shot back into their places.

In silence we returned to the library, and after a min-
ute or two I went to my own room. The last I saw of Count
Dracula was his kissing his hand to me, with a red light of
triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that Judas in hell
might be proud of.

When I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I
heard a whispering at my door. I went to it softly and list-
ened. Unless my ears deceived me, I heard the voice of the
Count.

"Back! Back to your own place! Your time is not yet
come. Wait! Have patience! Tonight is mine. Tomorrow night
is yours!"

There was a low, sweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage
I threw open the door, and saw without the three terrible
women licking their lips. As I appeared, they all joined in
a horrible laugh, and ran away.

I came back to my room and threw myself on my knees. It
is then so near the end? Tomorrow! Tomorrow! Lord, help me,
and those to whom I am dear!


30 June.--These may be the last words I ever write in
this diary. I slept till just before the dawn, and when I
woke threw myself on my knees, for I determined that if Death
came he should find me ready.

At last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew
that the morning had come. Then came the welcome cock-crow,
and I felt that I was safe. With a glad heart, I opened the
door and ran down the hall. I had seen that the door was
unlocked, and now escape was before me. With hands that
trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and threw
back the massive bolts.

But the door would not move. Despair seized me. I
pulled and pulled at the door, and shook it till, massive as
it was, it rattled in its casement. I could see the bolt shot.
It had been locked after I left the Count.

Then a wild desire took me to obtain the key at any
risk,and I determined then and there to scale the wall again,
and gain the Count's room. He might kill me, but death now
seemed the happier choice of evils. Without a pause I rushed
up to the east window, and scrambled down the wall,as before,
into the Count's room. It was empty, but that was as I ex-
pected. I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold
remained. I went through the door in the corner and down the
winding stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel. I
knew now well enough where to find the monster I sought.

The great box was in the same place, close against the
wall, but the lid was laid on it, not fastened down, but
with the nails ready in their places to be hammered home.

I knew I must reach the body for the key, so I raised
the lid, and laid it back against the wall. And then I saw
something which filled my very soul with horror. There lay
the Count, but looking as if his youth had been half restored.
For the white hair and moustache were changed to dark iron-
grey. The cheeks were fuller, and the white skin seemed
ruby-red underneath. The mouth was redder than ever, for on
the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the
corners of the mouth and ran down over the chin and neck.
Even the deep, burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh,
for the lids and pouches underneath were bloated. It seemed
as if the whole awful creature were simply gorged with blood.
He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his repletion.

I shuddered as I bent over to touch him,and every sense
in me revolted at the contact, but I had to search, or I was
lost. The coming night might see my own body a banquet in a
similar war to those horrid three. I felt all over the body,
but no sign could I find of the key. Then I stopped and look-
ed at the Count. There was a mocking smile on the bloated
face which seemed to drive me mad. This was the being I was
helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries
to come he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his
lust for blood, and create a new and ever-widening circle of
semi-demons to batten on the helpless.

The very thought drove me mad. A terrible desire came
upon me to rid the world of such a monster. There was no
lethal weapon at hand, but I seized a shovel which the work-
men had been using to fill the cases, and lifting it high,
struck, with the edge downward, at the hateful face. But as
I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell upon me, with all
their blaze of basilisk horror. The sight seemed to paralyze
me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the
face, merely making a deep gash above the forehead. The sho-
vel fell from my hand across the box,and as I pulled it away
the flange of the blade caught the edge of the lid which
fell over again, and hid the horrid thing from my sight. The
last glimpse I had was of the bloated face, blood-stained and
fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its own in
the nethermost hell.

I thought and thought what should be my next move, but
my brain seemed on fire,and I waited with a despairing feel-
ing growing over me. As I waited I heard in the distance
a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming closer, and through
their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the cracking of
whips. The Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had
spoken were coming. With a last look around and at the box
which contained the vile body, I ran from the place and
gained the Count's room, determined to rush out at the moment
the door should be opened. With strained ears, I listened,
and heard downstairs the grinding of the key in the great
lock and the falling back of the heavy door. There must
have been some other means of entry, or some one had a key
for one of the locked doors.

Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and
dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo. I
turned to run down again towards the vault, where I might
find the new entrance, but at the moment there seemed to
come a violent puff of wind, and the door to the winding
stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from the lint-
els flying. When I ran to push it open, I found that it
was hopelessly fast. I was again a prisoner, and the net
of doom was closing round me more closely.

As I write there is in the passage below a sound of
many tramping feet and the crash of weights being set down
heavily, doubtless the boxes, with their freight of earth.
There was a sound of hammering. It is the box being nailed
down. Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again along
the hall, with with many other idle feet coming behind them.

The door is shut, the chains rattle. There is a grind-
ing of the key in the lock. I can hear the key withdrawn,
then another door opens and shuts. I hear the creaking of
lock and bolt.

Hark! In the courtyard and down the rocky way the
roll of heavy wheels, the crack of whips, and the chorus of
the Szgany as they pass into the distance.

I am alone in the castle with those horrible women.
Faugh! Mina is a woman, and there is nought in common. They
are devils of the Pit!

I shall not remain alone with them. I shall try to
scale the castle wall farther than I have yet attempted. I
shall take some of the gold with me, lest I want it later. I
may find a way from this dreadful place.

And then away for home! Away to the quickest and near-
est train! Away from the cursed spot, from this cursed land,
where the devil and his children still walk with earthly
feet!

At least God's mercy is better than that of those mon-
sters, and the precipice is steep and high. At its foot a
man may sleep, as a man. Goodbye, all. Mina!





CHAPTER 5


LETTER FROM MISS MINA MURRAY TO MISS LUCY WESTENRA

9 May.

My dearest Lucy,


Forgive my long delay in writing, but I have been simply
overwhelmed with work. The life of an assistant schoolmist-
ress is sometimes trying. I am longing to be with you, and
by the sea, where we can talk together freely and build our
castles in the air. I have been working very hard lately,
because I want to keep up with Jonathan's studies, and I
have been practicing shorthand very assiduously. When we are
married I shall be able to be useful to Jonathan, and if I
can stenograph well enough I can take down what he wants to
say in this way and write it out for him on the typewriter,
at which also I am practicing very hard.

He and I sometimes write letters in shorthand, and he
is keeping a stenographic journal of his travels abroad.
When I am with you I shall keep a diary in the same way. I
don't mean one of those two-pages-to-the-week-with-Sunday-
squeezed-in-a-corner diaries, but a sort of journal which
I can write in whenever I feel inclined.

I do not suppose there will be much of interest to
other people, but it is not intended for them. I may show
it to Jonathan some day if there is in it anything worth
sharing, but it is really an exercise book. I shall try to
do what I see lady journalists do, interviewing and writing
descriptions and trying to remember conversations. I am told
that, with a little practice, one can remember all that goes
on or that one hears said during a day.

However, we shall see. I will tell you of my little
plans when we meet. I have just had a few hurried lines from
Jonathan from Transylvania. He is well, and will be return-
ing in about a week. I am longing to hear all his news. It
must be nice to see strange countries. I wonder if we, I
mean Jonathan and I, shall ever see them together. There is
the ten o'clock bell ringing. Goodbye.

Your loving

Mina


Tell me all the news when you write. You have not told
me anything for a long time. I hear rumours, and especially
of a tall, handsome, curly-haired man.???



LETTER, LUCY WESTENRA TO MINA MURRAY



17, Chatham Street

Wednesday

My dearest Mina,


I must say you tax me very unfairly with being a bad
correspondent. I wrote you twice since we parted, and your
last letter was only your second. Besides, I have nothing
to tell you. There is really nothing to interest you.

Town is very pleasant just now, and we go a great deal
to picture-galleries and for walks and rides in the park. As
to the tall, curly-haired man, I suppose it was the one who
was with me at the last Pop. Someone has evidently been
telling tales.

That was Mr. Holmwood. He often comes to see us, and
he and Mamma get on very well together, they have so many
things to talk about in common.

We met some time ago a man that would just do for you,
if you were not already engaged to Jonathan. He is an
excellant parti, being handsome, well off, and of good birth.
He is a doctor and really clever. Just fancy! He is only
nine-and twenty, and he has an immense lunatic asylum all
under his own care. Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, and
he called here to see us, and often comes now. I think he
is one of the most resolute men I ever saw, and yet the most
calm. He seems absolutely imperturbable. I can fancy what
a wonderful power he must have over his patients. He has a
curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if
trying to read one's thoughts. He tries this on very much
with me, but I flatter myself he has got a tough nut to crack.
I know that from my glass.

Do you ever try to read your own face? I do, and I can
tell you it is not a bad study, and gives you more trouble
than you can well fancy if you have never tried it.

He say that I afford him a curious psychological study,
and I humbly think I do. I do not, as you know, take suff-
icient interest in dress to be able to describe the new
fashions. Dress is a bore. That is slang again, but never
mind. Arthur says that every day.

There, it is all out, Mina, we have told all our secrets
to each other since we were children. We have slept together
and eaten together, and laughed and cried together, and now,
though I have spoken, I would like to speak more. Oh, Mina,
couldn't you guess? I love him. I am blushing as I write,
for although I think he loves me, he has not told me so in
words. But, oh, Mina, I love him. I love him! There, that
does me good.

I wish I were with you, dear, sitting by the fire un-
dressing, as we used to sit, and I would try to tell you
what I feel. I do not know how I am writing this even to
you. I am afraid to stop, or I should tear up the letter,
and I don't want to stop, for I do so want to tell you all.
Let me hear from you at once, and tell me all that you think
about it. Mina, pray for my happiness.

Lucy


P.S.--I need not tell you this is a secret. Goodnight
again. L.




LETTER, LUCY WESTENRA TO MINA MURRAY

24 May

My dearest Mina,


Thanks, and thanks, and thanks again for your sweet
letter. It was so nice to be able to tell you and to have
your sympathy.

My dear, it never rains but it pours. How true the old
proverbs are. Here am I, who shall be twenty in September,
and yet I never had a proposal till today, not a real pro-
posal, and today I had three. Just fancy! Three proposals
in one day! Isn't it awful! I feel sorry, really and truly
sorry, for two of the poor fellows. Oh, Mina, I am so happy
that I don't know what to do with myself. And three propos-
als! But, for goodness' sake, don't tell any of the girls,
or they would be getting all sorts of extravagant ideas, and
imagining themselves injured and slighted if in their very
first day at home they did not get six at least. Some girls
are so vain! You and I, Mina dear, who are engaged and are
going to settle down soon soberly into old married women,
can despise vanity. Well, I must tell you about the three,
but you must keep it a secret, dear, from every one except,
of course, Jonathan. You will tell him, because I would, if
I were in your place, certainly tell Arthur. A woman ought
to tell her husband everything. Don't you think so, dear?
And I must be fair. Men like women, certainly their wives,
to be quite as fair as they are. And women, I am afraid, are
not always quite as fair as they should be.

Well, my dear, number One came just before lunch. I
told you of him, Dr. John Seward, the lunatic asylum man,
with the strong jaw and the good forehead. He was very cool
outwardly, but was nervous all the same. He had evidently
been schooling himself as to all sorts of little things, and
remembered them, but he almost managed to sit down on his
silk hat, which men don't generally do when they are cool,
and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept playing
with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream. He spoke
to me, Mina, very straightfordwardly. He told me how dear I
was to him, though he had known me so little, and what his
life would be with me to help and cheer him. He was going to
tell me how unhappy he would be if I did not care for him,
but when he saw me cry he said he was a brute and would not
add to my present trouble. Then he broke off and asked if I
could love him in time, and when I shook my head his hands
trembled, and then with some hesitation he asked me if I
cared already for any one else. He put it very nicely, saying
that he did not want to wring my confidence from me, but on-
ly to know, because if a woman's heart was free a man might
have hope. And then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty to tell
him that there was some one. I only told him that much, and
then he stood up, and he looked very strong and very grave
as he took both my hands in his and said he hoped I would be
happy, and that If I ever wanted a friend I must count him
one of my best.

Oh, Mina dear, I can't help crying, and you must excuse
this letter being all blotted. Being proposed to is all very
nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn't at all a happy
thing when you have to see a poor fellow, whom you know loves
you honestly, going away and looking all broken hearted, and
to know that, no matter what he may say at the moment, you
are passing out of his life. My dear, I must stop here at
present, I feel so miserable, though I am so happy.

Evening.


Arthur has just gone, and I feel in better spirits than
when I left off, so I can go on telling you about the day.

Well, my dear, number Two came after lunch. He is such
a nice fellow,and American from Texas, and he looks so young
and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that he has
been to so many places and has such adventures. I sympathize
with poor Desdemona when she had such a stream poured in her
ear, even by a black man. I suppose that we women are such
cowards that we think a man will save us from fears, and we
marry him. I know now what I would do if I were a man and
wanted to make a girl love me. No, I don't, for there was
Mr. Morris telling us his stories, and Arthur never told any,
and yet. . .

My dear, I am somewhat previous. Mr. Quincy P. Morris
found me alone. It seems that a man always does find a girl
alone. No, he doesn't, for Arthur tried twice to make a
chance, and I helping him all I could, I am not ashamed to
say it now. I must tell you beforehand that Mr. Morris does-
n't always speak slang, that is to say, he never does so to
strangers or before them, for he is really well educated and
has exquisite manners, but he found out that it amused me to
hear him talk American slang,and whenever I was present, and
there was no one to be shocked, he said such funny things. I
am afraid, my dear, he has to invent it all, for it fits
exactly into whatever else he has to say. But this is a way
slang has. I do not know myself if I shall ever speak slang.
I do not know if Arthur likes it, as I have never heard him
use any as yet.

Well, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and looked as happy
and jolly as he could, but I could see all the same that he
was very nervous. He took my hand in his, and said ever so
sweetly. . .

"Miss Lucy, I know I ain't good enough to regulate the
fixin's of your little shoes, but I guess if you wait till
you find a man that is you will go join them seven young wo-
men with the lamps when you quit. Won't you just hitch up
along-side of me and let us go down the long road together,
driving in double harness?"

Well, he did look so hood humoured and so jolly that it
didn't seem half so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr.
Seward. So I said, as lightly as I could, that I did not
know anything of hitching, and that I wasn't broken to harn-
ess at all yet. Then he said that he had spoken in a light
manner, and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing
so on so grave, so momentous, and occasion for him, I would
forgive him. He really did look serious when he was saying
it, and I couldn't help feeling a sort of exultation that he
was number Two in one day. And then, my dear, before I could
say a word he began pouring out a perfect torrent of love-
making, laying his very heart and soul at my feet. He looked
so earnest over it that I shall never again think that a man
must be playful always, and never earnest, because he is
merry at times. I suppose he saw something in my face which
checked him, for he suddenly stopped,and said with a sort of
manly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been
free. . .

"Lucy, you are an honest hearted girl, I know. I should
not be here speaking to you as I am now if I did not believe
you clean grit, right through to the very depths of your soul.
Tell me, like one good fellow to another, is there any one
else that you care for? And if there is I'll never trouble
you a hair's breadth again, but will be, if you will let me,
a very faithful friend."

My dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so
little worthy of them? Here was I almost making fun of this
great hearted, true gentleman. I burst into tears, I am
afraid, my dear, you will think this a very sloppy letter in
more ways than one, and I really felt very badly.

Why can't they let a girl marry three men, or as many as
want her, and save all this trouble? But this is heresy, and
I must not say it. I am glad to say that, though I was cry-
ing, I was able to look into Mr. Morris' brave eyes, and I
told him out straight. . .

"Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told
me yet that he even loves me." I was right to speak to him
so frankly, for quite a light came into his face, and he put
out both his hands and took mine, I think I put them into
his, and said in a hearty way. . .

"That's my brave girl. It's better worth being late for
a chance of winning you than being in time for any other
girl in the world. Don't cry, my dear. If it's for me, I'm
a hard nut to crack, and I take it standing up. If that
other fellow doesn't know his happiness, well, he'd better
look for it soon, or he'll have to deal with me. Little girl,
your honesty and pluck have made me a friend, and that's
rarer than a lover, it's more selfish anyhow. My dear, I'm
going to have a pretty lonely walk between this and Kingdom
Come. Won't you give me one kiss? It'll be something to keep
off the darkness now and then. You can, you know, if you
like, for that other good fellow, or you could not love him,
hasn't spoken yet."

That quite won me, Mina, for it was brave and sweet of
him, and noble too, to a rival, wasn't it? And he so sad,
so I leant over and kissed him.

He stood up with my two hands in his, and as he looked
down into my face, I am afraid I was blushing very much, he
said, "Little girl, I hold your hand, and you've kissed me,
and if these things don't make us friends nothing ever will.
Thank you for your sweet honesty to me, and goodbye."

He wrung my hand, and taking up his hat, went straight
out of the room without looking back, without a tear or a
quiver or a pause, and I am crying like a baby.

Oh, why must a man like that be made unhappy when there
are lots of girls about who would worship the very ground he
trod on? I know I would if I were free, only I don't want
to be free My dear, this quite upset me, and I feel I
cannot write of happiness just at once, after telling you of
it,and I don't wish to tell of the number Three until it can
be all happy. Ever your loving. . .

Lucy


P.S.--Oh, about number Three, I needn't tell you of
number Three, need I? Besides, it was all so confused. It
seemed only a moment from his coming into the room till both
his arms were round me, and he was kissing me. I am very,
very happy, and I don't know what I have done to deserve it.
I must only try in the future to show that I am not ungrate-
ful to God for all His goodness to me in sending to me such
a lover, such a husband, and such a friend.

Goodbye.

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY
(Kept in phonograph)


25 May.--Ebb tide in appetite today. Cannot eat, can-
not rest, so diary instead. since my rebuff of yesterday I
have a sort of empty feeling. Nothing in the world seems of
sufficient importance to be worth the doing. As I knew that
the only cure for this sort of thing was work, I went amongst
the patients. I picked out one who has afforded me a study
of much interest. He is so quaint that I am determined to
understand him as well as I can. Today I seemed to get nearer
than ever before to the heart of his mystery.

I questioned him more fully than I had ever done, with
a view to making myself master of the facts of his halluci-
nation. In my manner of doing it there was, I now see, some-
thing of cruelty. I seemed to wish to keep him to the point
of his madness, a thing which I avoid with the patients as I
would the mouth of hell.

(Mem., Under what circumstances would I not avoid the
pit of hell?) Omnia Romae venalia sunt. Hell has its price!
If there be anything behind this instinct it will be valu-
able to trace it afterwards accurately, so I had better
commence to do so, therefore. . .

R. M, Renfield, age 59. Sanguine temperament, great
physical strength, morbidly excitable, periods of gloom, end-
ing in some fixed idea which I cannot make out. I presume
that the sanguine temperament itself and the disturbing in-
fluence end in a mentally-accomplished finish, a possibly
dangerous man, probably dangerous if unselfish. In selfish
men caution is as secure an armour for their foes as for
themselves. What I think of on this point is, when self is
the fixed point the centripetal force is balanced with the
centrifugal. When duty, a cause, etc., is the fixed point,
the latter force is paramount, and only accident of a series
of accidents can balance it.


LETTER, QUINCEY P. MORRIS TO HON. ARTHUR HOLMOOD


25 May.

My dear Art,

We've told yarns by the campfire in the prairies, and
dressed one another's wounds after trying a landing at the
Marquesas, and drunk healths on the shore of Titicaca. There
are more yarns to be told,and other wounds to be healed, and
another health to be drunk. Won't you let this be at my
campfire tomorrow night? I have no hesitation in asking you,
as I know a certain lady is engaged to a certain dinner
party, and that you are free. There will only be one other,
our old pal at the Korea, Jack Seward. He's coming, too, and
we both want to mingle our weeps over the wine cup, and to
drink a health with all our hearts to the happiest man in
all the wide world, who has won the noblest heart that God
has made and best worth winning. We promise you a hearty
welcome, and a loving greeting, and a health as true as your
own right hand. We shall both swear to leave you at home if
you drink too deep to a certain pair of eyes. Come!

Yours, as ever and always,

Quincey P. Morris

CHAPTER 6


MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL


24 July. Whitby.--Lucy met me at the station, looking
sweeter and lovlier than ever, and we drove up to the house
at the Crescent in which they have rooms. This is a lovely
place. The little river, the Esk, runs through a deep vall-
ey, which broadens out as it comes near the harbour. A great
viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the view
seems somehow further away than it really is. The valley is
beautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on
the high land on either side you look right across it, un-
less you are near enough to see down. The houses of the old
town--the side away from us, are all red-roofed, and seem
piled up one over the other anyhow, like the pictures we see
of Nuremberg. Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby Abb-
ey, which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of
part of "Marmion," where the girl was built up in the wall.
It is a most noble ruin, of immense size, and full of beaut-
iful and romantic bits. There is a legend that a white lady
is seen in one of the windows. Between it and the town there
is another church, the parish one, round which is a big
graveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to my mind the
nicest spot in Whitby, for it lies right over the town, and
has a full view of the harbour and all up the bay to where
the headland called Kettleness stretches out into the sea. It
descends so steeply over the harbour that part of the bank
has fallen away, and some of the graves have been destroyed.

In one place part of the stonework of the graves stret-
ches out over the sandy pathway far below. There are walks,
with seats beside them, through the churchyard, and people
go and sit there all day long looking at the beautiful view
and enjoying the breeze.

I shall come and sit here often myself and work. Indeed,
I am writing now, with my book on my knee, and listening to
the talk of three old men who are sitting beside me. They
seem to do nothing all day but sit here and talk.

The harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one
long granite wall stretching out into the sea, with a curve
outwards at the end of it, in the middle of which is a light-
house. A heavy seawall runs along outside of it. On the
near side, the seawall makes an elbow crooked inversely, and
its end too has a lighthouse. Between the two piers there
is a narrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly
widens.

It is nice at high water, but when the tide is out it
shoals away to nothing,and there is merely the stream of the
Esk, running between banks of sand, with rocks here and
there. Outside the harbour on this side there rises for a-
bout half a mile a great reef, the sharp of which runs
straight out from behind the south lighthouse. At the end of
it is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and
sends in a mournful sound on the wind.

They have a legend here that when a ship is lost bells
are heard out at sea. I must ask the old man about this. He
is coming this way. . .

He is a funny old man. He must be awfully old, for his
face is gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree. He tells
me that he is nearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in
the Greenland fishing fleet when Waterloo was fought. He is,
I am afraid, a very sceptical person, for when I asked him
about the bells at sea and the White Lady at the abbey he
said very brusquely,

"I wouldn't fash masel' about them, miss. Them things
be all wore out. Mind, I don't say that they never was, but
I do say that they wasn't in my time. They be all very well
for comers and trippers, an' the like, but not for a nice
young lady like you. Them feet-folks from York and Leeds
that be always eatin'cured herrin's and drinkin' tea an'
lookin' out to buy cheap jet would creed aught. I wonder
masel' who'd be bothered tellin' lies to them, even the
newspapers, which is full of fool-talk."

I thought he would be a good person to learn interest-
ing things from, so I asked him if he would mind telling me
something about the whale fishing in the old days. He was
just settling himself to begin when the clock struck six,
whereupon he laboured to get up, and said,

"I must gang ageeanwards home now, miss. My grand-
daughter doesn't like to be kept waitin' when the tea is
ready, for it takes me time to crammle aboon the grees, for
there be a many of `em, and miss, I lack belly-timber sairly
by the clock."

He hobbled away, and I could see him hurrying, as well
as he could, down the steps. The steps are a great feature
on the place. They lead from the town to the church, there
are hundreds of them, I do not know how many, and they wind
up in a delicate curve. The slope is so gentle that a horse
could easily walk up and down them.

I think they must originally have had something to do
with the abbey. I shall go home too. Lucy went out, visit-
ing with her mother, and as they were only duty calls, I did
not go.


1 August.--I came up here an hour ago with Lucy, and we
had a most interesting talk with my old friend and the two
others who always come and join him. He is evidently the Sir
Oracle of them,and I should think must have been in his time
a most dictatorial person.

He will not admit anything, and down faces everybody. If
he can't out-argue them he bullies them,and then takes their
silence for agreement with his views.

Lucy was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock.
She has got a beautiful colour since she has been here.

I noticed that the old men did not lose any time in
coming and sitting near her when we sat down. She is so sweet
with old people, I think they all fell in love with her on
the spot. Even my old man succumbed and did not contradict
her, but gave me double share instead. I got him on the sub-
ject of the legends , and he went off at once into a sort of
sermon. I must try to remember it and put it down.

"It be all fool-talk, lock, stock, and barrel, that's
what it be and nowt else. These bans an' wafts an' boh-ghosts
an' bar-guests an' bogles an' all anent them is only fit to
set bairns an' dizzy women a'belderin'. They be nowt but
air-blebs. They, an' all grims an' signs an' warnin's, be
all invented by parsons an' illsome berk-bodies an' railway
touters to skeer an' scunner hafflin's, an' to get folks to
do somethin' that they don't other incline to. It makes me
ireful to think o' them. Why, it's them that, not content
with printin' lies on paper an' preachin' them ou t of
pulpits, does want to be cuttin' them on the tombstones. Look
here all around you in what airt ye will. All them steans,
holdin' up their heads as well as they can out of their
pride, is acant, simply tumblin' down with the weight o' the
lies wrote on them, `Here lies the body' or `Sacred to the
memory' wrote on all of them, an' yet in nigh half of them
there bean't no bodies at all, an' the memories of them
bean't cared a pinch of snuff about, much less sacred. Lies
all of them, nothin' but lies of one kind or another! My gog,
but it'll be a quare scowderment at the Day of Judgment when
they come tumblin' up in their death-sarks, all jouped toge-
ther an' trying' to drag their tombsteans with them to prove
how good they was, some of them trimmlin' an' dithering, with
their hands that dozzened an' slippery from lyin' in the sea
that they can't even keep their gurp o' them."

I could see from the old fellow's self-satisfied air
and the way in which he looked round for the approval of his
cronies that he was "showing off," so I put in a word to
keep him going.

"Oh, Mr. Swales, you can't be serious. Surely these
tombstones are not all wrong?"

"Yabblins! There may be a poorish few not wrong, savin'
where they make out the people too good, for there be folk
that do think a balm-bowl be like the sea, if only it be
their own. The whole thing be only lies. Now look you here.
You come here a stranger, an' you see this kirkgarth."

I nodded, for I thought it better to assent, though I
did not quite understand his dialect. I knew it had some-
thing to do with the church.

He went on, "And you consate that all these steans be
aboon folk that be haped here, snod an' snog?" I assented
again. "Then that be just where the lie comes in. Why,
there be scores of these laybeds that be toom as old Dun's
`baccabox on Friday night."

He nudged one of his companions, and they all laughed.
"And, my gog! How could they be otherwise? Look at that
one, the aftest abaft the bier-bank, read it!"

I went over and read, "Edward Spencelagh, master marin-
er, murdered by pirates off the coast of Andres, April, 1854,
age 30." When I came back Mr. Swales went on,

"Who brought him home, I wonder, to hap him here? Murd-
ered off the coast of Andres! An' you consated his body lay
under! Why, I could name ye a dozen whose bones lie in the
Greenland seas above," he pointed northwards, "or where the
currants may have drifted them. There be the steans around
ye. Ye can, with your young eyes, read the small print of
the lies from here. This Braithwaite Lowery, I knew his
father, lost in the Lively off Greenland in `20, or Andrew
Woodhouse, drowned in the same seas in 1777, or John Paxton,
drowned off Cape Farewell a year later, or old John Rawlings,
whose grandfather sailed with me, drowned in the Gulf of
Finland in `50. Do ye think that all these men will have to
make a rush to Whitby when the trumpet sounds? I have me
antherums aboot it! I tell ye that when they got here they'd
be jommlin' and jostlin' one another that way that it `ud be
like a fight up on the ice in the old days, when we'd be
at one another from daylight to dark, an' tryin' to tie up
our cuts by the aurora borealis." This was evidently local
pleasantry, for the old man cackled over it, and his cronies
joined in with gusto.

"But," I said, "surely you are not quite correct, for
you start on the assumption that all the poor people, or
their spirits, will have to take their tombstones with them
on the Day of Judgment. Do you think that will be really
necessary?"

"Well, what else be they tombstones for? Answer me
that, miss!"

"To please their relatives, I suppose."

"To please their relatives, you suppose!" This he said
with intense scorn. "How will it pleasure their relatives to
know that lies is wrote over them, and that everybody in the
place knows that they be lies?"

He pointed to a stone at our feet which had been laid
down as a slab, on which the seat was rested, close to the
edge of the cliff. "Read the lies on that thruff-stone," he
said.

The letters were upside down to me from where I sat, but
Lucy was more opposite to them, so she leant over and read,
"Sacred to the memory of George Canon, who died, in the hope
of a glorious resurrection, on July 29,1873, falling from the
rocks at Kettleness. This tomb was erected by his sorrowing
mother to her dearly beloved son.`He was the only son of his
mother, and she was a widow.' Really, Mr. Swales, I don't
see anything very funny in that!" She spoke her comment very
gravely and somewhat severely.

"Ye don't see aught funny! Ha-ha! But that's because ye
don't gawm the sorrowin'mother was a hell-cat that hated him
because he was acrewk'd, a regular lamiter he was, an' he
hated her so that he committed suicide in order that she
mightn't get an insurance she put on his life. He blew nigh
the top of his head off with an old musket that they had for
scarin' crows with. `twarn't for crows then, for it brought
the clegs and the dowps to him. That's the way he fell off
the rocks. And, as to hopes of a glorious resurrection, I've
often heard him say masel' that he hoped he'd go to hell, for
his mother was so pious that she'd be sure to go to heaven,
an' he didn't want to addle where she was. Now isn't that
stean at any rate," he hammered it with his stick as he spoke,
"a pack of lies? And won't it make Gabriel keckle when
Geordie comes pantin' ut the grees with the tompstean balan-
ced on his hump, and asks to be took as evidence!"

I did not know what to say, but Lucy turned the conver-
sation as she said, rising up, "Oh, why did you tell us of
this? It is my favorite seat, and I cannot leave it, and now
I find I must go on sitting over the grave of a suicide."

"That won't harm ye, my pretty, an' it may make poor
Geordie gladsome to have so trim a lass sittin' on his lap.
That won't hurt ye. Why, I've sat here off an' on for nigh
twenty years past, an' it hasn't done me no harm. Don't ye
fash about them as lies under ye, or that doesn' lie there
either! It'll be time for ye to be getting scart when ye see
the tombsteans all run away with, and the place as bare as a
stubble-field. There's the clock, and'I must gang. My service
to ye, ladies!" And off he hobbled.

Lucy and I sat awhile, and it was all so beautiful be-
fore us that we took hands as we sat, and she told me all
over again about Arthur and their coming marriage. That made
me just a little heart-sick, for I haven't heard from Jona-
than for a whole month.


The same day. I came up here alone, for I am very sad.
There was no letter for me. I hope there cannot be anything
the matter with Jonathan. The clock has just struck nine. I
see the lights scattered all over the town, sometimes in rows
where the streets are, and sometimes singly. They run right
up the Esk and die away in the curve of the valley. To my
left the view is cut off by a black line of roof of the old
house next to the abbey. The sheep and lambs are bleating in
the fields away behind me, and there is a clatter of donkeys'
hoofs up the paved road below. The band on the pier is play-
ing a harsh waltz in good time, and further along the quay
there is a Salvation Army meeting in a back street. Neither
of the bands hears the other, but up here I hear and see
them both. I wonder where Jonathan is and if he is thinking
of me! I wish he were here.


DR. SEWARD'S DIARY

5 June.--The case of Renfield grows more interesting the
more I get to understand the man. He has certain qualities
very largely developed, selfishness, secrecy, and purpose.

I wish I could get at what is the object of the latter.
He seems to have some settled scheme of his own, but what it
is I do not know. His redeeming quality is a love of animals,
though, indeed, he has such curious turns in it that I some-
times imagine he is only abnormally cruel. His pets are of
odd sorts.

Just now his hobby is catching flies. He has at pre-
sent such a quantity that I have had myself to expostulate.
To my astonishment, he did not break out into a fury, as I
expected, but took the matter in simple seriousness. He
thought for a moment, and then said, "May I have three days?
I shall clear them away." Of course, I said that would do.
I must watch him.


18 June.--He has turned his mind now to spiders,and has
got several very big fellows in a box. He keeps feeding them
his flies, and the number of the latter is becoming sensibly
diminished, although he has used half his food in attracting
more flies from outside to his room.


1 July.--His spiders are now becoming as great a nui-
sance as his flies, and today I told him that he must get
rid of them.

He looked very sad at this, so I said that he must some
of them, at all events. He cheerfully acquiesced in this,
and I gave him the same time as before for reduction.

He disgusted me much while with him, for when a horrid
blowfly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the
room, he caught it, held it exultantly for a few moments be-
tween his finger and thumb, and before I knew what he was
going to do, put it in his mouth and ate it.

I scolded him for it, but he argued quietly that it was
very good and very wholesome, that it was life, strong life,
and gave life to him. This gave me an idea, or the rudiment
of one. I must watch how he gets rid of his spiders.

He has evidently some deep problem in his mind, for he
keeps a little notebook in which he is always jotting down
something. whole pages of it are filled with masses of fig-
ures, generally single numbers added up in batches, and then
the totals added in batches again, as though he were focuss-
ing some account, as the auditors put it.


8 July.--There is a method in his madness,and the rudi-
mentary idea in my mind is growing. It will be a whole idea
soon, and then, oh, unconscious cerebration, you will have
to give the wall to your conscious brother.

I kept away from my friend for a few days, so that I
might notice if there were any change. Things remain as they
were except that he has parted with some of his pets and got
a new one.

He has managed to get a sparrow, and has already par-
tially tamed it. His means of taming is simple, for already
the spiders have diminshed. Those that do remain, however,
are well fed, for he still brings in the flies by tempting
them with his food.

19 July--We are progressing. My friend has now a whole
colony of sparrows, and his flies and spiders are almost ob-
literated. When I came in he ran to me and said he wanted
to ask me a great favour, a very, very great favour. And as
he spoke, he fawned on me like a dog.

I asked him what it was, and he said, with a sort of
rapture in his voice and bearing, "A kitten, a nice, little,
sleek playful kitten, that I can play with, and teach, and
feed, and feed, and feed!"

I was not unprepared for this request, for I had noticed
how his pets went on increasing in size and vivacity, but I
did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrows should
be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and spiders.
So I said I would see about it, and asked him if he would
not rather have a cat than a kitten.

His eagerness betrayed him as he answered, "Oh, yes, I
would like a cat! I only asked for a kitten lest you should
refuse me a cat. No one would refuse me a kitten, would
they?"

I shook my head, and said that at present I feared it
would not be possible, but that I would see about it. His
face fell, and I could see a warning of danger in it, for
there was a sudden fierce, sidelong look which meant killing.
The man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac. I shall test
him with his present craving and see how it will work out,
then I shall know more.


10 pm.--I have visited him again and found him sitting
in a corner brooding. When I came in he threw himself on
his knees before me and implored me to let him have a cat,
that his salvation depended upon it.

I was firm, however, and told him that he could not
have it, whereupon he went without a word, and sat down,
gnawing his fingers, in the corner where I had found him. I
shall see him in the morning early.


20 July.--Visited Renfield very early, before attendant
went his rounds. Found him up and humming a tune. He was
spreading out his sugar, which he had saved, in the window,
and was manifestly beginning his fly catching again, and be-
ginning it cheerfully and with a good grace.

I looked around for his birds,and not seeing them,asked
him where they were. He replied, without turning round, that
they had all flown away. There were a few feathers about the
room and on his pillow a drop of blood. I said nothing, but
went and told the keeper to report to me if there were any-
thing odd about him during the day.


11 am.--The attendant has just been to see me to say
that Renfield has been very sick and has disgorged a whole
lot of feathers. "My belief is, doctor," he said, "that he
has eaten his birds, and that he just took and ate them raw!"


11 pm.--I gave Renfield a strong opiate tonight, enough
to make even him sleep, and took away his pocketbook to look
at it. The thought that has been buzzing about my brain
lately is complete, and the theory proved.

My homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind. I shall have
to invent a new classification for him, and call him a zoo-
phagous (life-eating) maniac. What he desires is to absorb
as many lives as he can, and he has laid himself out to ac-
hieve it in a cumulative way. He gave many flies to one
spider and many spiders to one bird, and then wanted a cat
to eat the many birds. What would have been his later steps?

It would almost be worth while to complete the exper-
iment. It might be done if there were only a sufficient
cause. Men sneered at vivisection, and yet look at its re-
sults today! Why not advance science in its most difficult
and vital aspect, the knowledge of the brain?

Had I even the secret of one such mind, did I hold the
key to the fancy of even one lunatic, I might advance my own
branch of science to a pitch compared with which Burdon-
Sanderson's physiology or Ferrier's brain knowledge would be
as nothing. If only there were a sufficient cause! I must
not think too much of this, or I may be tempted. A good
cause might turn the scale with me, for may not I too be of
an exceptional brain, congenitally?

How well the man reasoned. Lunatics always do within
their own scope. I wonder at how many lives he values a man,
or if at only one. He has closed the account most accurately,
and today begun a new record. How many of us begin a new
record with each day of our lives?

To me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended
with my new hope, and that truly I began a new record. So it
shall be until the Great Recorder sums me up and closes my
ledger account with a balance to profit or loss.

Oh, Lucy, Lucy, I cannot be angry with you, nor can I be
angry with my friend whose happiness is yours, but I must
only wait on hopeless and work. Work! Work!

If I could have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend
there, a good, unselfish cause to make me work, that would
be indeed happiness.


MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL


26 July.--I am anxious,and it soothes me to express my-
self here. It is like whispering to one's self and listening
at the same time. And there is also something about the
shorthand symbols that makes it different from writing. I am
unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan. I had not heard from
Jonathan for some time, and was very concerned, but yesterday
dear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent me a letter
from him. I had written asking him if he had heard, and he
said the enclosed had just been received. It is only a line
dated from Castle Dracula, and says that he is just starting
for home. That is not like Jonathan. I do not understand it,
and it makes me uneasy.

Then, too, Lucy , although she is so well, has lately
taken to her old habit of walking in her sleep. Her mother
has spoken to me about it, and we have decided that I am to
lock the door of our room every night.

Mrs. Westenra has got an idea that sleep-walkers always
go out on roofs of houses and along the edges of cliffs and
then get suddenly wakened and fall over with a despairing
cry that echoes all over the place.

Poor dear, she is naturally anxious about Lucy, and she
tells me that her husband, Lucy's father, had the same habit,
that he would get up in the night and dress himself and go
out, if he were not stopped.

Lucy is to be married in the autumn, and she is already
planning out her dresses and how her house is to be arranged.
I sympathise with her, for I do the same, only Jonathan and
I will start in life in a very simple way, and shall have to
try to make both ends meet.

Mr. Holmwood, he is the Hon. Arthur Holmwood, only son
of Lord Godalming, is coming up here very shortly, as soon as
he can leave town, for his father is not very well, and I
think dear Lucy is counting the moments till he comes.

She wants to take him up in the seat on the churchyard
cliff and show him the beauty of Whitby. I daresay it is the
waiting which disturbs her. She will be all right when he
arrives.


27 July.--No news from Jonathan. I am getting quite un-
easy about him, though why I should I do not know, but I do
wish that he would write, if it were only a single line.

Lucy walks more than ever, and each night I am awakened
by her moving about the room. Fortunately, the weather is so
hot that she cannot get cold. But still, the anxiety and the
perpetually being awakened is beginning to tell on me, and I
am getting nervous and wakeful myself. Thank God, Lucy's
health keeps up. Mr. Holmwood has been suddenly called to
Ring to see his father, who has been taken seriously ill.
Lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him, but it does
not touch her looks. She is a trifle stouter, and her cheeks
are a lovely rose-pink. She has lost the anemic look which
she had. I pray it will all last.


3 August.--Another week gone by, and no news from Jona-
than, not even to Mr. Hawkins, from whom I have heard. Oh,
I do hope he is not ill. He surely would have written. I
look at that last letter of his, but somehow it does not
satisfy me. It does not read like him, and yet it is his
writing. There is no mistake of that.

Lucy has not walked much in her sleep the last week, but
there is an odd concentration about her which I do not under-
stand, even in her sleep she seems to be watching me. She
tries the door, and finding it locked, goes about the room
searching for the key.


6 August.--Another three days, and no news. This sus-
pense is getting dreadful. If I only knew where to write to
or where to go to, I should feel easier. But no one has
heard a word of Jonathan since that last letter. I must
only pray to God for patience.

Lucy is more excitable than ever, but is otherwise well.
Last night was very threatening, and the fishermen say that
we are in for a storm. I must try to watch it and learn the
weather signs.

Today is a gray day,and the sun as I write is hidden in
thick clouds, high over Kettleness. Everything is gray except
the green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it, gray
earthy rock, gray clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far
edge, hang over the gray sea, into which the sandpoints
stretch like gray figures. The sea is tumbling in over the
shallows and the sandy flats with a roar, muffled in the
sea-mists drifting inland. The horizon is lost in a gray
mist. All vastness, the clouds are piled up like giant
rocks, and there is a `brool' over the sea that sounds like
some passage of doom. Dark figures are on the beach here and
there, sometimes half shrouded in the mist, and seem `men
like trees walking'. The fishing boats are racing for home,
and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into the
harbour, bending to the scuppers. Here comes old Mr. Swales.
He is making straight for me, and I can see, by the way he
lifts his hat, that he wants to talk.


I have been quite touched by the change in the poor old
man. When he sat down beside me, he said in a very gentle
way, "I want to say something to you, miss."

I could see he was not at ease, so I took his poor old
wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak fully.

So he said, leaving his hand in mine, "I'm afraid, my
deary, that I must have shocked you by all the wicked things
I've been sayin' about the dead, and such like, for weeks
past, but I didn't mean them, and I want ye to remember that
when I'm gone. We aud folks that be daffled, and with one
foot abaft the krok-hooal, don't altogether like to think of
it, and we don't want to feel scart of it, and that's why
I've took to makin' light of it, so that I'd cheer up my
own heart a bit. But, Lord love ye, miss, I ain't afraid of
dyin', not a bit, only I don't want to die if I can help it.
My time must be nigh at hand now, for I be aud, and a hundred
years is too much for any man to expect. And I'm so nigh it
that the Aud Man is already whettin' his scythe. Ye see, I
can't get out o' the habit of caffin' about it all at once.
The chafts will wag as they be used to. Some day soon the
Angel of Death will sound his trumpet for me. But don't ye
dooal an' greet, my deary!"--for he saw that I was crying--
"if he should come this very night I'd not refuse to answer
his call. For life be, after all, only a waitin' for some-
thin' else than what we're doin', and death be all that we
can rightly depend on. But I'm content, for it's comin' to
me, my deary, and comin' quick. It may be comin' while we be
lookin' and wonderin'. Maybe it's in that wind out over the
sea that's bringin' with it loss and wreck, and sore dis-
tress, and sad hearts. Look! Look!" he cried suddenly.
"There's something in that wind and in the hoast beyont that
sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smells like death. It's
in the air. I feel it comin'. Lord, make me answer cheerful,
when my call comes!" He held up his arms devoutly, and rai-
sed his hat. His mouth moved as though he were praying.
After a few minutes' silence, he got up, shook hands with me,
and blessed me, and said good-bye, and hobbled off. It all
touched me, and upset me very much.

I was glad when the coastguard came along, with his
spyglass under his arm. He stopped to talk with me, as he
always does, but all the time kept looking at a strange ship.

"I can't make her out," he said. "She's a Russian, by
the look of her. But she's knocking about in the queerest
way. She doesn't know her mind a bit. She seems to see the
storm coming, but can't decide whether to run up north in the
open, or to put in here. Look there again! She is steered
mighty strangely, for she doesn't mind the hand on the wheel,
changes about with every puff of wind. We'll hear more of
her before this time tomorrow."




CHAPTER 7


CUTTING FROM "THE DAILYGRAPH," 8 AUGUST


(PASTED IN MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL)


From a correspondent.


Whitby.


One of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has
just been experienced here, with results both strange and
unique. The weather had been somewhat sultry, but not to
any degree uncommon in the month of August. Saturday even-
ing was as fine as was ever known, and the great body of
holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave
Woods, Robin Hood's Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and
the various trips in the neighborhood of Whitby. The
steamers Emma and Scarborough made trips up and down the
coast, and there was an unusual amount of `tripping' both
to and from Whitby. The day was unusually fine till the
afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East
Cliff churchyard, and from the commanding eminence watch
the wide sweep of sea visible to the north and east, called
attention to a sudden show of `mares tails' high in the sky
to the northwest. The wind was then blowing from the south-
west in the mild degree which in barometrical language is
ranked `No. 2, light breeze.'

The coastguard on duty at once made report, and one old
fisherman, who for more than half a century has kept watch on
weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic
manner the coming of a sudden storm. The approach of sunset
was so very beautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly
coloured clouds, that there was quite an assemblage on the
walk along the cliff in the old churchyard to enjoy the
beauty.  Before the sun dipped below the black mass of Kettle-
ness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its downward
was was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset colour,
flame, purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of
gold, with here and there masses not large, but of seemingly
absolute blackness, in all sorts of shapes, as well outlined
as colossal silhouettes. The experience was not lost on the
painters, and doubtless some of the sketches of the `Prelude
to the Great Storm' will grace the R. A and R. I. walls in
May next.

More than one captain made up his mind then and there
that his `cobble' or his `mule', as they term the different
classes of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm
had passed. The wind fell away entirely during the evening,
and at midnight there was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and
that prevailing intensity which, on the approach of thunder,
affects persons of a sensitive nature.

There were but few lights in sight at sea, for even
the coasting steamers, which usually hug the shore so closely,
kept well to seaward,and but few fishing boats were in sight.
The only sail noticeable was a foreign schooner with all
sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. The foolhard-
iness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for
comment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made
to signal her to reduce sail in the face of her danger. Be-
fore the night shut down she was seen with sails idly flapp-
ing as she gently rolled on the undulating swell of the sea.

"As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean."


Shortly before ten o'clock the stillness of the air
grew quite oppressive,and the silence was so marked that the
bleating of a sheep inland or the barking of a dog in the
town was distinctly heard, and the band on the pier, with
its lively French air, was like a dischord in the great har-
mony of nature's silence. A little after midnight came a
strange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air
began to carry a strange, faint, hollow booming.

Then without warning the tempest broke. With a rapidity
which, at the time, seemed incredible,and even afterwards is
impossible to realize, the whole aspect of nature at once
became convulsed. The waves rose in growing fury, each over-
topping its fellow, till in a very few minutes the lately
glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster. White-
crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up
the shelving cliffs. Others broke over the piers, and with
their spume swept the lanthorns of the lighthouses which
rise from the end of either pier of Whitby Harbour.

The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such force
that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their
feet, or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions. It
was found necessary to clear the entire pier from the mass
of onlookers, or else the fatalities of the night would have
increased manifold. To add to the difficulties and dangers
of the time, masses of sea-fog came drifting inland. White,
wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion, so dank and
damp and cold that it needed but little effort of imagina-
tion to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were
touching their living brethren with the clammy hands of
death, and many a one shuddered at the wreaths of sea-mist
swept by.

At times the mist cleared, and the sea for some dis-
tance could be seen in the glare of the lightning, which
came thick and fast, followed by such peals of thunder that
the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock of
the footsteps of the storm.

Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable
grandeur and of absorbing interest. The sea, running mount-
ains high, threw skywards with each wave mighty masses of
white foam, which the tempest seemed to snatch at and whirl
away into space. Here and there a fishing boat, with a rag
of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast, now and
again the white wings of a storm-tossed seabird. On the
summit of the East Cliff the new searchlight was ready for
experiment, but had not yet been tried. The officers in
charge of it got it into working order, and in the pauses of
onrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea. Once or
twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing boat,
with gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by
the guidance of the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of
dashing against the piers. As each boat achieved the safety
of the port there was a shout of joy from the mass of people
on the shore,a shout which for a moment seemed to cleave the
gale and was then swept away in its rush.

Before long the searchlight discovered some distance
away a schooner with all sails set, apparently the same ves-
sel which had been noticed earlier in the evening. The wind
had by this time backed to the east, and there was a shudder
amongst the watchers on the cliff as they realized the terr-
ible danger in which she now was.

Between her and the port lay the great flat reef on
which so many good ships have from time to time suffered,
and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter, it would
be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of
the harbour.

It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves
were so great that in their troughs the shallows of the
shore were almost visible, and the schooner, with all sails
set, was rushing with such speed that, in the words of one
old salt, "she must fetch up somewhere, if it was only in
hell". Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than any
hitherto, a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all
things like a gray pall, and left available to men only the
organ of hearing, for the roar of the tempest, and the crash
of the thunder, and the booming of the mighty billows came
through the damp oblivion even louder than before. The rays
of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour mouth
across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men
waited breathless.

The wind suddenly shifted to the northeast, and the
remnant of the sea fog melted in the blast. And then,
mirabile dictu, between the piers, leaping from wave to wave
as it rushed at headlong speed, swept the strange schooner
before the blast, with all sail set, and gained the safety
of the harbour. The searchlight followed her, and a shudder
ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a
corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro
at each motion of the ship. No other form could be seen on
the deck at all.

A great awe came on all as they realised that the ship,
as if by a miracle, had found the harbour, unsteered save by
the hand of a dead man! However, all took place more quickly
than it takes to write these words. The schooner paused not,
but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on that
accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and
many storms into the southeast corner of the pier jutting
under the East Cliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier.

There was of course a considerable concussion as the
vessel drove up on the sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay
was strained,and some of the `top-hammer' came crashing down.
But, strangest of all, the very instant the shore was touched,
an immense dog sprang up on deck from below,as if shot up by
the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow on
the sand.

Making straight for the steep cliff, where the church-
yard hangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that
some of the flat tombstones, thruffsteans or through-stones,
as they call them in Whitby vernacular, actually project
over where the sustaining cliff has fallen away, it disa-
ppeared in the darkness, which seemed intensified just
beyond the focus of the searchlight.

It so happened that there was no one at the moment on
Tate Hill Pier, as all those whose houses are in close prox-
imity were either in bed or were out on the heights above.
Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern side of the har-
bour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the first
to climb aboard. The men working the searchlight, after
scouring the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything,
then turned the light on the derelict and kept it there. The
coastguard ran aft, and when he came beside the wheel, bent
over to examine it,and recoiled at once as though under some
sudden emotion. This seemed to pique general curiosity, and
quite a number of people began to run.

It is a good way round from the West Cliff by the Draw-
bridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your correspondent is a fairly
good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd. When I arri-
ved, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd,
whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on
board. By the courtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your
correspondent, permitted to climb on deck, and was one of a
small group who saw the dead seaman whilst actually lashed
to the wheel.

It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or
even awed, for not often can such a sight have been seen.
The man was simply fastened by his hands, tied one over the
other, to a spoke of the wheel. Between the inner hand and
the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it was
fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept
fast by the binding cords. The poor fellow may have been
seated at one time, but the flapping and buffeting of the
sails had worked through the rudder of the wheel and had
dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he
was tied had cut the flesh to the bone.

Accurate note was made of the state of things, and a
doctor, Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot Place, who
came immediately after me, declared, after making examina-
tion, that the man must have been dead for quite two days.

In his pocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty
save for a little roll of paper, which proved to be the
addendum to the log.

The coastguard said the man must have tied up his own
hands, fastening the knots with his teeth. The fact that a
coastguard was the first on board may save some complica-
tions later on, in the Admiralty Court, for coastguards
cannot claim the salvage which is the right of the first
civilian entering on a derelict. Already, however, the legal
tongues are wagging, and one young law student is loudly
asserting that the rights of the owner are already complete-
ly sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of
the statues of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if
not proof, of delegated possession, is held in a dead hand.

It is needless to say that the dead steersman has been
reverently removed from the place where he held his honour-
able watch and ward till death, a steadfastness as noble as
that of the young Casabianca, and placed in the mortuary to
await inquest.

Already the sudden storm is passing,and its fierceness
is abating. Crowds are scattering backward, and the sky is
beginning to redden over the Yorkshire wolds.

I shall send, in time for your next issue, further de-
tails of the derelict ship which found her way so miracu-
lously into harbour in the storm.


9 August.--The sequel to the strange arrival of the
derelict in the storm last night is almost more startling
than the thing itself. It turns out that the schooner is
Russian from Varna, and is called the Demeter. She is almost
entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a small amount
of cargo, a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould.

This cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr. S.F.
Billington, of 7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard
and took formal possession of the goods consigned to him.

The Russian consul, too, acting for the charter-party,
took formal possession of the ship, and paid all harbour
dues, etc.

Nothing is talked about here today except the strange
coincidence. The officials of the Board of Trade have been
most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made
with existing regulations. As the matter is to be a `nine
days wonder', they are evidently determined that there shall
be no cause of other complaint.

A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog
which landed when the ship struck, and more than a few of
the members of the S.P.C.A., which is very strong in Whitby,
have tried to befriend the animal. To the general disa-
ppointment, however, it was not to be found. It seems to
have disappeared entirely from the town. It may be that it
was frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is
still hiding in terror.

There are some who look with dread on such a possibil-
ity, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for
it is evidently a fierce brute. Early this morning a large
dog, a half-bred mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close
to Tate Hill Pier, was found dead in the roadway opposite
its master's yard. It had been fighting, and manifestly had
had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn away, and its
belly was slit open as if with a savage claw.


Later.--By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector,
I have been permitted to look over the log book of the Deme-
ter, which was in order up to within three days, but con-
tained nothing of special interest except as to facts of
missing men. The greatest interest, however, is with regard
to the paper found in the bottle, which was today produced at
the inquest. And a more strange narrative than the two bet-
ween them unfold it has not been my lot to come across.

As there is no motive for concealment, I am permitted to
use them, and accordingly send you a transcript, simply
omitting technical details of seamanship and supercargo. It
almost seems as though the captain had been seized with some
kind of mania before he had got well into blue water, and
that this had developed persistently throughout the voyage.
Of course my statement must be taken cum grano, since I am
writing from the dictation of a clerk of the Russian consul,
who kindly translated for me, time being short.

LOG OF THE "DEMETER"
Varna to Whitby


Written 18 July, things so strange happening, that I
shall keep accurate note henceforth till we land.


On 6 July we finished taking in cargo, silver sand and
boxes of earth. At noon set sail. East wind, fresh. Crew,
five hands. . .two mates, cook, and myself, (captain).


On 11 July at dawn entered Bosphorus. Boarded by
Turkish Customs officers. Backsheesh. All correct. Under
way at 4 p. m.


On 12 July through Dardanelles. More Customs officers
and flagboat of guarding squadron. Backsheesh again. Work
of officers thorough, but quick. Want us off soon. At dark
passed into Archipelago.


On 13 July passed Cape Matapan. Crew dissatisfied about
something. Seemed scared, but would not speak out.


On 14 July was somewhat anxious about crew. Men all
steady fellows, who sailed with me before. Mate could not
make out what was wrong. They only told him there was SOME-
THING, and crossed themselves. Mate lost temper with one of
them that day and struck him. Expected fierce quarrel, but
all was quiet.


On 16 July mate reported in the morning that one of the
crew, Petrofsky, was missing. Could not account for it. Took
larboard watch eight bells last night, was relieved by Amra-
moff, but did not go to bunk. Men more downcast than ever.
All said they expected something of the kind, but would not
say more than there was SOMETHING aboard. Mate getting very
impatient with them. Feared some trouble ahead.


On 17 July, yesterday, one of the men, Olgaren, came to
my cabin, and in an awestruck way confided to me that he
thought there was a strange man aboard the ship. He said that
in his watch he had been sheltering behind the deckhouse, as
there was a rain storm, when he saw a tall, thin man, who was
not like any of the crew, come up the companionway, and go
along the deck forward and disappear. He followed cautiously,
but when he got to bows found no one, and the hatchways were
all closed. He was in a panic of superstitious fear, and I
am afraid the panic may spread. To allay it, I shall today
search the entire ship carefully from stem to stern.


Later in the day I got together the whole crew, and told
them, as they evidently thought there was some one in the
ship, we would search from stem to stern. First mate angry,
said it was folly, and to yield to such foolish ideas would
demoralise the men, said he would engage to keep them out of
trouble with the handspike. I let him take the helm, while
the rest began a thorough search, all keeping abreast, with
lanterns. We left no corner unsearched. As there were only
the big wooden boxes, there were no odd corners where a man
could hide. Men much relieved when search over, and went
back to work cheerfully. First mate scowled, but said nothing.


22 July.--Rough weather last three days, and all hands
busy with sails, no time to be frightened. Men seem to have
forgotten their dread. Mate cheerful again, and all on good
terms. Praised men for work in bad weather. Passed Gibral-
tar and out through Straits. All well.


24 July.--There seems some doom over this ship. Already
a hand short, and entering the Bay of Biscay with wild wea-
ther ahead, and yet last night another man lost, disappeared.
Like the first, he came off his watch and was not seen again.
Men all in a panic of fear, sent a round robin, asking to
have double watch, as they fear to be alone. Mate angry.
Fear there will be some trouble, as either he or the men will
do some violence.


28 July.--Four days in hell, knocking about in a sort of
malestrom, and the wind a tempest. No sleep for any one. Men
all worn out. Hardly know how to set a watch, since no one
fit to go on. Second mate volunteered to steer and watch,
and let men snatch a few hours sleep. Wind abating, seas
still terrific, but feel them less, as ship is steadier.


29 July.--Another tragedy. Had single watch tonight, as
crew too tired to double. When morning watch came on deck
could find no one except steersman. Raised outcry, and all
came on deck. Thorough search, but no one found. Are now
without second mate, and crew in a panic. Mate and I agreed
to go armed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause.


30 July.--Last night. Rejoiced we are nearing England.
Weather fine, all sails set. Retired worn out, slept sound-
ly, awakened by mate telling me that both man of watch and
steersman missing. Only self and mate and two hands left to
work ship.


1 August.--Two days of fog, and not a sail sighted. Had
hoped when in the English Channel to be able to signal for
help or get in somewhere. Not having power to work sails,
have to run before wind. Dare not lower, as could not raise
them again. We seem to be drifting to some terrible doom.
Mate now more demoralised than either of men. His stronger
nature seems to have worked inwardly against himself. Men
are beyond fear, working stolidly and patiently, with minds
made up to worst. They are Russian, he Roumanian.


2 August, midnight.--Woke up from few minutes sleep by
hearing a cry, seemingly outside my port. Could see nothing
in fog. Rushed on deck, and ran against mate. Tells me he
heard cry and ran, but no sign of man on watch. One more
gone. Lord, help us! Mate says we must be past Straits of
Dover, as in a moment of fog lifting he saw North Foreland,
just as he heard the man cry out. If so we are now off in
the North Sea, and only God can guide us in the fog, which
seems to move with us, and God seems to have deserted us.


3 August.--At midnight I went to relieve the man at the
wheel and when I got to it found no one there. The wind was
steady, and as we ran before it there was no yawing. I dared
not leave it, so shouted for the mate. After a few seconds,
he rushed up on deck in his flannels. He looked wild-eyed
and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has given way. He
came close to me and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to
my ear, as though fearing the very air might hear. "It is
here. I know it now. On the watch last night I saw It,
like a man, tall and thin, and ghastly pale. It was in the
bows, and looking out. I crept behind It, and gave it my
knife, but the knife went through It, empty as the air." And
as he spoke he took the knife and drove it savagely into
space. Then he went on, "But It is here, and I'll find It.
It is in the hold, perhaps in one of those boxes. I'll un-
screw them one by one and see. You work the helm." And with
a warning look and his finger on his lip, he went below.
There was springing up a choppy wind, and I could not leave
the helm. I saw him come out on deck again with a tool chest
and lantern, and go down the forward hatchway. He is mad,
stark, raving mad, and it's no use my trying to stop him. He
can't hurt those big boxes, they are invoiced as clay, and
to pull them about is as harmless a thing as he can do. So
here I stay and mind the helm, and write these notes. I can
only trust in God and wait till the fog clears. Then, if I
can't steer to any harbour with the wind that is, I shall
cut down sails, and lie by, and signal for help. . .

It is nearly all over now. Just as I was beginning to
hope that the mate would come out calmer, for I heard him
knocking away at something in the hold, and work is good for
him, there came up the hatchway a sudden, startled scream,
which made my blood run cold, and up on the deck he came as
if shot from a gun, a raging madman, with his eyes rolling
and his face convulsed with fear. "Save me! Save me!" he
cried, and then looked round on the blanket of fog. His
horror turned to despair, and in a steady voice he said, "You
had better come too, captain, before it is too late. He is
there! I know the secret now. The sea will save me from
Him, and it is all that is left!" Before I could say a word,
or move forward to seize him, he sprang on the bulwark and
deliberately threw himself into the sea. I suppose I know
the secret too, now. It was this madman who had got rid of
the men one by one, and now he has followed them himself.
God help me! How am I to account for all these horrors when
I get to port? When I get to port! Will that ever be?


4 August.--Still fog, which the sunrise cannot pierce, I
know there is sunrise because I am a sailor, why else I know
not. I dared not go below, I dared not leave the helm, so
here all night I stayed, and in the dimness of the night I
saw it, Him! God, forgive me, but the mate was right to
jump overboard. It was better to die like a man. To die
like a sailor in blue water, no man can object. But I am
captain, and I must not leave my ship. But I shall baffle
this fiend or monster, for I shall tie my hands to the wheel
when my strength begins to fail, and along with them I shall
tie that which He, It, dare not touch. And then, come good
wind or foul, I shall save my soul, and my honour as a
captain. I am growing weaker, and the night is coming on. If
He can look me in the face again, I may not have time to
act. . . If we are wrecked, mayhap this bottle may be found,
and those who find it may understand. If not. . .well,
then all men shall know that I have been true to my trust.
God and the Blessed Virgin and the Saints help a poor ignor-
ant soul trying to do his duty. . .


Of course the verdict was an open one. There is no
evidence to adduce, and whether or not the man himself comm-
itted the murders there is now none to say. The folk here
hold almost universally that the captain is simply a hero,
and he is to be given a public funeral. Already it is arran-
ged that his body is to be taken with a train of boats up
the Esk for a piece and then brought back to Tate Hill Pier
and up the abbey steps, for he is to be buried in the church-
yard on the cliff. The owners of more than a hundred boats
have already given in their names as wishing to follow him
to the grave.

No trace has ever been found of the great dog, at which
there is much mourning, for, with public opinion in its pre-
sent state, he would, I believe, be adopted by the town. To-
morrow will see the funeral, and so will end this one more
`mystery of the sea'.



MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL


8 August.--Lucy was very restless all night, and I too,
could not sleep. The storm was fearful, and as it boomed
loudly among the chimney pots, it made me shudder. When a
sharp puff came it seemed to be like a distant gun. Strange-
ly enough, Lucy did not wake, but she got up twice and dress-
ed herself. Fortunately, each time I awoke in time and
managed to undress her without waking her, and got her back
to bed. It is a very strange thing, this sleep-walking, for
as soon as her will is thwarted in any physical way, her in-
tention, if there be any, disappears, and she yields herself
almost exactly to the routine of her life.

Early in the morning we both got up and went down to
the harbour to see if anything had happened in the night.
There were very few people about, and though the sun was
bright, and the air clear and fresh, the big, grim-looking
waves, that seemed dark themselves because the foam that
topped them was like snow, forced themselves in through the
mouth of the harbour, like a bullying man going through a
crowd. Somehow I felt glad that Jonathan was not on the sea
last night, but on land. But, oh, is he on land or sea?
Where is he, and how? I am getting fearfully anxious about
him. If I only knew what to do, and could do anything!


10 August.--The funeral of the poor sea captain today
was most touching. Every boat in the harbour seemed to be
there, and the coffin was carried by captains all the way
from Tate Hill Pier up to the churchyard. Lucy came with
me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst the cortege
of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down
again. We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly
all the way. The poor fellow was laid to rest near our seat
so that we stood on it, when the time came and saw everything.

Poor Lucy seemed much upset. She was restless and
uneasy all the time, and I cannot but think that her dreaming
at night is telling on her. She is quite odd in one thing.
She will not admit to me that there is any cause for rest-
lessness, or if there be, she does not understand it herself.

There is an additional cause in that poor Mr. Swales
was found dead this morning on our seat, his neck being
broken. He had evidently, as the doctor said, fallen back
in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was a look of
fear and horror on his face that the men said made them
shudder. Poor dear old man!

Lucy is so sweet and sensitive that she feels influ-
ences more acutely than other people do. Just now she was
quite upset by a little thing which I did not much heed,
though I am myself very fond of animals.

One of the men who came up here often to look for the
boats was followed by his dog. The dog is always with him.
They are both quiet persons, and I never saw the man angry,
nor heard the dog bark. During the service the dog would not
come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a
few yards off, barking and howling. Its master spoke to it
gently, and then harshly, and then angrily. But it would
neither come nor cease to make a noise. It was in a fury,
with its eyes savage, and all its hair bristling out like a
cat's tail when puss is on the war path.

Finally the man too got angry, and jumped down and
kicked the dog, and then took it by the scruff of the neck
and half dragged and half threw it on the tombstone on which
the seat is fixed. The moment it touched the stone the poor
thing began to tremble. It did not try to get away, but
crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was in such a
pitiable state of terror that I tried, though without effect,
to comfort it.

Lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to
touch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way.
I greatly fear that she is of too super sensitive a nature
to go through the world without trouble. She will be dream-
ing of this tonight, I am sure. The whole agglomeration of
things, the ship steered into port by a dead man, his atti-
tude, tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads, the
touching funeral, the dog, now furious and now in terror,
will all afford material for her dreams.

I think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out
physically, so I shall take her for a long walk by the
cliffs to Robin Hood's Bay and back. She ought not to have
much inclination for sleep-walking then.





CHAPTER 8


MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL


Same day, 11 o'clock P.M.--Oh, but I am tired! If it
were not that I had made my diary a duty I should not open
it tonight. We had a lovely walk. Lucy, after a while, was
in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some dear cows who came
nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse, and
frightened the wits out of us. I believe we forgot every-
thing, except of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe
the slate clean and give us a fresh start. We had a capital
`severe tea' at Robin Hood's Bay in a sweet little old-
fashioned inn, with a bow window right over the seaweed-
covered rocks of the strand. I believe we should have shock-
ed the `New Woman' with our appetites. Men are more tolerant,
bless them! Then we walked home with some, or rather many,
stoppages to rest, and with our hearts full of a constant
dread of wild bulls.

Lucy was really tired, and we intended to creep off to
bed as soon as we could. The young curate came in, however,
and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay for supper. Lucy and I
had both a fight for it with the dusty miller. I know it was
a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic. I think that
some day the bishops must get together and see about breed-
ing up a new class of curates, who don't take supper, no
matter how hard they may be pressed to, and who will know
when girls are tired.

Lucy is asleep and breathing softly. She has more color
in her cheeks than usual, and looks, oh so sweet. If Mr.
Holmwood fell in love with her seeing her only in the draw-
ing room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her now. Some
of the `New Women' writers will some day start an idea that
men and women should be allowed to see each other asleep be-
fore proposing or accepting. But I suppose the `New Woman'
won't condescend in future to accept. She will do the pro-
posing herself. And a nice job she will make of it too!
There's some consolation in that. I am so happy tonight,
because dear Lucy seems better. I really believe she has
turned the corner, and that we are over her troubles with
dreaming. I should be quite happy if I only knew if Jona-
than. . .God bless and keep him.


11 August.--Diary again. No sleep now, so I may as well
write. I am too agitated to sleep. We have had such an ad-
venture, such an agonizing experience. I fell asleep as soon
as I had closed my diary. . . Suddenly I became broad awake,
and sat up, with a horrible sense of fear upon me, and of
some feeling of emptiness around me. The room was dark, so I
could not see Lucy's bed. I stole across and felt for her.
The bed was empty. I lit a match and found that she was not
in the room. The door was shut, but not locked, as I had
left it. I feared to wake her mother, who has been more than
usually ill lately, so threw on some clothes and got ready to
look for her. As I was leaving the room it struck me that
the clothes she wore might give me some clue to her dreaming
intention. Dressing-gown would mean house, dress outside.
Dressing-gown and dress were both in their places. "Thank
God," I said to myself, "she cannot be far, as she is only
in her nightdress."

I ran downstairs and looked in the sitting room. Not
there! Then I looked in all the other rooms of the house,
with an ever-growing fear chilling my heart. Finally, I
came to the hall door and found it open. It was not wide
open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. The people
of the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I
feared that Lucy must have gone out as she was. There was no
time to think of what might happen. A vague over-mastering
fear obscured all details.

I took a big, heavy shawl and ran out. The clock was
striking one as I was in the Crescent, and there was not a
soul in sight. I ran along the North Terrace, but could see
no sign of the white figure which I expected. At the edge of
the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour to
the East Cliff, in the hope or fear, I don't know which, of
seeing Lucy in our favorite seat.

There was a bright full moon, with heavy black, driving
clouds, which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama
of light and shade as they sailed across. For a moment or
two I could see nothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured
St. Mary's Church and all around it. Then as the cloud
passed I could see the ruins of the abbey coming into view,
and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as a
sword-cut moved along, the church and churchyard became
gradually visible. Whatever my expectation was, it was not
disappointed, for there, on our favorite seat, the silver
light of the moon struck a half-reclining figure, snowy white.
The coming of the cloud was too quick for me to see much, for
shadow shut down on light almost immediately, but it seemed
to me as though something dark stood behind the seat where
the white figure shone, and bent over it. What it was, whe-
ther man or beast, I could not tell.

I did not wait to catch another glance, but flew down
the steep steps to the pier and along by the fish-market to
the bridge, which was the only way to reach the East Cliff.
The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see. I re-
joiced that it was so, for I wanted no witness of poor Lucy's
condition. The time and distance seemed endless, and my
knees trembled and my breath came laboured as I toiled up
the endless steps to the abbey. I must have gone fast, and
yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with lead,
and as though every joint in my body were rusty.

When I got almost to the top I could see the seat and
the white figure, for I was now close enough to distinguish
it even through the spells of shadow. There was undoubtedly
something, long and black, bending over the half-reclining
white figure. I called in fright, "Lucy! Lucy!" and some-
thing raised a head, and from where I was I could see a
white face and red, gleaming eyes.

Lucy did not answer, and I ran on to the entrance of the
churchyard. As I entered, the church was between me and the
seat, and for a minute or so I lost sight of her. When I
came in view again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight
struck so brilliantly that I could see Lucy half reclining
with her head lying over the back of the seat. She was
quite alone, and there was not a sign of any living thing
about.

When I bent over her I could see that she was still
asleep. Her lips were parted, and she was breathing, not
softly as usual with her, but in long, heavy gasps, as though
striving to get her lungs full at every breath. As I came
close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the collar
of her nightdress close around her, as though she felt the
cold. I flung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges
tight around her neck, for I dreaded lest she should get
some deadly chill from the night air, unclad as she was. I
feared to wake her all at once, so, in order to have my hands
free to help her, I fastened the shawl at her throat with a
big safety pin. But I must have been clumsy in my anxiety
and pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her
breathing became quieter, she put her hand to her throat
again and moaned. When I had her carefully wrapped up I put
my shoes on her feet, and then began very gently to wake her.

At first she did not respond, but gradually she became
more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing occa-
sionally. At last, as time was passing fast, and for many
other reasons, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her
forcibly, till finally she opened her eyes and awoke. She
did not seem surprised to see me, as, of course, she did not
realize all at once where she was.

Lucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when
her body must have been chilled with cold, and her mind some-
what appalled at waking unclad in a churchyard at night, she
did not lose her grace. She trembled a little, and clung to
me. When I told her to come at once with me home, she rose
without a word, with the obedience of a child. As we passed
along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince.
She stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes, but
I would not. However, when we got to the pathway outside the
chruchyard, where there was a puddle of water, remaining from
the storm, I daubed my feet with mud, using each foot in turn
on the other, so that as we went home, no one, in case we
should meet any one, should notice my bare feet.

Fortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a
soul. Once we saw a man, who seemed not quite sober, pass-
ing along a street in front of us. But we hid in a door till
he had disappeared up an opening such as there are here,
steep little closes, or `wynds', as they call them in Scot-
land. My heart beat so loud all the time sometimes I
thought I should faint. I was filled with anxiety about Lucy,
not only for her health, lest she should suffer from the ex-
posure, but for her reputation in case the story should get
wind. When we got in, and had washed our feet, and had said
a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into bed.
Before falling asleep she asked, even implored, me not to
say a word to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-
walking adventure.

I hesitated at first, to promise, but on thinking of the
state of her mother's health, and how the knowledge of such
a thing would fret her, and think too, of how such a story
might become distorted, nay, infallibly would, in case it
should leak out, I thought it wiser to do so. I hope I did
right. I have locked the door, and the key is tied to my
wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed. Lucy is
sleeping soundly. The reflex of the dawn is high and far
over the sea. . .


Same day, noon.--All goes well. Lucy slept till I woke
her and seemed not to have even changed her side. The ad-
venture of the night does not seem to have harmed her, on
the contrary, it has benefited her, for she looks better
this morning than she has done for weeks. I was sorry to
notice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her.
Indeed, it might have been serious, for the skin of her
throat was pierced. I must have pinched up a piece of loose
skin and have transfixed it, for there are two little red
points like pin-pricks, and on the band of her nightdress
was a drop of blood. When I apologised and was concerned
about it, she laughed and petted me, and said she did not
even feel it. Fortunately it cannot leave a scar, as it is
so tiny.


Same day, night.--We passed a happy day. The air was
clear, and the sun bright, and there was a cool breeze. We
took our lunch to Mulgrave Woods, Mrs. Westenra driving by
the road and Lucy and I walking by the cliff-path and join-
ing her at the gate. I felt a little sad myself, for I
could not but feel how absolutely happy it would have been
had Jonathan been with me. But there! I must only be
patient. In the evening we strolled in the Casino Terrace,
and heard some good music by Spohr and Mackenzie, and went
to bed early. Lucy seems more restful than she has been for
some time, and fell asleep at once. I shall lock the door
and secure the key the same as before, though I do not expect
any trouble tonight.


12 August.--My expectations were wrong, for twice dur-
ing the night I was wakened by Lucy trying to get out. She
seemed, even in her sleep, to be a little impatient at find-
ing the door shut, and went back to bed under a sort of
protest. I woke with the dawn, and heard the birds chirp-
ing outside of the window. Lucy woke, too, and I was glad
to see, was even better than on the previous morning. All
her old gaiety of manner seemed to have come back, and she
came and snuggled in beside me and told me all about Arthur.
I told her how anxious I was about Jonathan, and then she
tried to comfort me. Well, she succeeded somewhat, for,
though sympathy can't alter facts, it can make them more
bearable.


13 August.--Another quiet day, and to bed with the key
on my wrist as before. Again I awoke in the night, and
found Lucy sitting up in bed, still asleep, pointing to the
window. I got up quietly, and pulling aside the blind,
looked out. It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft effect
of the light over the sea and sky, merged together in one
great silent mystery, was beautiful beyond words. Between me
and the moonlight flitted a great bat, coming and going in
great whirling circles. Once or twice it came quite close,
but was, I suppose, frightened at seeing me, and flitted away
across the harbour towards the abbey. When I came back from
the window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peace-
fully. She did not stir again all night.


14 August.--On the East Cliff, reading and writing all
day. Lucy seems to have become as much in love with the spot
as I am, and it is hard to get her away from it when it is
time to come home for lunch or tea or dinner. This after-
noon she made a funny remark. We were coming home for dinner,
and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier
and stopped to look at the view, as we generally do. The
setting sun, low down in the sky, was just dropping behind
Kettleness. The red light was thrown over on the East Cliff
and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe everything in a
beautiful rosy glow. We were silent for a while, and
suddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself. . .

"His red eyes again! They are just the same." It was
such an odd expression, coming apropos of nothing, that it
quite startled me. I slewed round a little, so as to see
Lucy well without seeming to stare at her, and saw that she
was in a half dreamy state, with an odd look on her face
that I could not quite make out, so I said nothing, but
followed her eyes. She appeared to be looking over at our
own seat, whereon was a dark figure seated alone. I was
quite a little startled myself, for it seemed for an instant
as if the stranger had great eyes like burning flames, but
a second look dispelled the illusion. The red sunlight was
shining on the windows of St. Mary's Church behind our seat,
and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in
the refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the
light moved. I called Lucy's attention to the peculiar
effect, and she became herself with a start, but she looked
sad all the same. It may have been that she was thinking
of that terrible night up there. We never refer to it, so
I said nothing, and we went home to dinner. Lucy had a head-
ache and went early to bed. I saw her asleep, and went out
for a little stroll myself.

I walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full
of sweet sadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan. When coming
home, it was then bright moonlight, so bright that, though
the front of our part of the Crescent was in shadow, every-
thing could be well seen, I threw a glance up at our window,
and saw Lucy's head leaning out. I opened my handkerchief
and waved it. She did not notice or make any movement what-
ever. Just then, the moonlight crept round an angle of the
building, and the light fell on the window. There distinctly
was Lucy with her head lying up against the side of the win-
dow sill and her eyes shut. She was fast asleep, and by her,
seated on the window sill, was something that looked like a
good-sized bird. I was afraid she might get a chill, so I
ran upstairs, but as I came into the room she was moving back
to her bed, fast asleep, and breathing heavily. She was hold-
ing her hand to her throat, as though to protect if from the
cold.

I did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly. I have
taken care that the door is locked and the window securely
fastened.

She looks so sweet as she sleeps, but she is paler than
is her wont, and there is a drawn, haggard look under her
eyes which I do not like. I fear she is fretting about some-
thing. I wish I could find out what it is.


15 August.--Rose later than usual. Lucy was languid and
tired, and slept on after we had been called. We had a happy
surprise at breakfast. Arthur's father is better, and wants
the marriage to come off soon. Lucy is full of quiet joy,
and her mother is glad and sorry at once. Later on in the day
she told me the cause. She is grieved to lose Lucy as her
very own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some
one to protect her. Poor dear, sweet lady! She confided to
me that she has got her death warrant. She has not told Lucy,
and made me promise secrecy. Her doctor told her that within
a few months, at most, she must die, for her heart is weak-
ening. At any time, even now, a sudden shock would be almost
sure to kill her.  Ah, we were wise to keep from her the affair
of the dreadful night of Lucy's sleep-walking.


17 August.--No diary for two whole days. I have not
had the heart to write. Some sort of shadowy pall seems to
be coming over our happiness. No news from Jonathan, and
Lucy seems to be growing weaker, whilst her mother's hours
are numbering to a close. I do not understand Lucy's fading
away as she is doing. She eats well and sleeps well, and
enjoys the fresh air, but all the time the roses in her
cheeks are fading, and she gets weaker and more languid day
by day. At night I hear her gasping as if for air.

I keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist
at night, but she gets up and walks about the room, and sits
at the open window. Last night I found her leaning out when
I woke up, and when I tried to wake her I could not.

She was in a faint. When I managed to restore her, she
was weak as water, and cried silently between long, painful
struggles for breath. When I asked her how she came to be
at the window she shook her head and turned away.

I trust her feeling ill may not be from that unlucky
prick of the safety-pin. I looked at her throat just now as
she lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed.
They are still open, and, if anything, larger than before,
and the edges of them are faintly white. They are like little
white dots with red centres. Unless they heal within a day
or two, I shall insist on the doctor seeing about them.

MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL.


18 August.--I am happy today, and write sitting on the
seat in the churchyard. Lucy is ever so much better. Last
night she slept well all night, and did not disturb me once.

The roses seem coming back already to her cheeks, though
she is still sadly pale and wan-looking. If she were in any
way anemic I could understand it, but she is not. She is in
gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness.  All the morbid
reticence seems to have passed from her, and she has just
reminded me, as if I needed any reminding, of that night, and
that it was here, on this very seat, I found her asleep.

As she told me she tapped playfully with the heel of
her boot on the stone slab and said,

"My poor little feet didn't make much noise then! I
daresay poor old Mr. Swales would have told me that it was
because I didn't want to wake up Geordie."

As she was in such a communicative humour, I asked her
if she had dreamed at all that night.

Before she answered, that sweet, puckered look came into
her forehead, which Arthur, I call him Arthur from her habit,
says he loves, and indeed, I don't wonder that he does. Then
she went on in a half-dreaming kind of way, as if trying to
recall it to herself.

"I didn't quite dream, but it all seemed to be real. I
only wanted to be here in this spot. I don't know why, for I
was afraid of something, I don't know what. I remember,
though I suppose I was asleep, passing through the streets
and over the bridge. A fish leaped as I went by, and I lean-
ed over to look at it, and I heard a lot of dogs howling. The
whole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling
at once, as I went up the steps. Then I had a vague memory
of something long and dark with red eyes, just as we saw in
the sunset, and something very sweet and very bitter all
around me at once. And then I seemed sinking into deep green
water, and there was a singing in my ears, as I have heard
there is to drowning men, and then everything seemed passing
away from me. My soul seemed to go out from my body and
float about the air. I seem to remember that once the West
Lighthouse was right under me, and then there was a sort of
agonizing feeling, as if I were in an earthquake, and I came
back and found you shaking my body. I saw you do it before
I felt you."

Then she began to laugh. It seemed a little uncanny to
me, and I listened to her breathlessly. I did not quite like
it, and thought it better not to keep her mind on the subject,
so we drifted on to another subject, and Lucy was like her
old self again. When we got home the fresh breeze had braced
her up, and her pale cheeks were really more rosy. Her mother
rejoiced when she saw her, and we all spent a very happy
evening together.


19 August.--Joy, joy, joy! Although not all joy. At
last, news of Jonathan. The dear fellow has been ill, that
is why he did not write. I am not afraid to think it or to
say it, now that I know. Mr. Hawkins sent me on the letter,
and wrote himself, oh so kindly. I am to leave in the morn-
ing and go over to Jonathan, and to help to nurse him if
necessary, and to bring him home. Mr. Hawkins says it would
not be a bad thing if we were to be married out there. I
have cried over the good Sister's letter till I can feel it
wet against my bosom, where it lies. It is of Jonathan, and
must be near my heart, for he is in my heart. My journey is
all mapped out, and my luggage ready. I am only taking one
change of dress. Lucy will bring my trunk to London and keep
it till I send for it, for it may be that. . .I must write
no more. I must keep it to say to Jonathan, my husband. The
letter that he has seen and touched must comfort me till we
meet.

LETTER, SISTER AGATHA, HOSPITAL OF ST. JOSEPH AND STE. MARY
BUDA-PESTH, TO MISS WILLHELMINA MURRAY

12 August,

"Dear Madam.

"I write by desire of Mr. Jonathan Harker, who is him-
self not strong enough to write, though progressing well,
thanks to God and St. Joseph and Ste. Mary. He has been
under our care for nearly six weeks, suffering from a vio-
lent brain fever. He wishes me to convey his love, and to
say that by this post I write for him to Mr. Peter Hawkins,
Exeter, to say, with his dutiful respects, that he is sorry
for his delay, and that all of his work is completed. He will
require some few weeks' rest in our sanatorium in the hills,
but will then return. He wishes me to say that he has not
sufficient money with him, and that he would like to pay for
his staying here, so that others who need shall not be want-
ing for belp.

Believe me,

Yours, with sympathy

and all blessings.
Sister Agatha"


"P.S.--My patient being asleep, I open this to let you
know something more. He has told me all about you, and that
you are shortly to be his wife. All blessings to you both!
He has had some fearful shock, so says our doctor, and in his
delirium his ravings have been dreadful, of wolves and poison
and blood, of ghosts and demons, and I fear to say of what.
Be careful of him always that there may be nothing to excite
him of this kind for a long time to come. The traces of such
an illness as his do not lightly die away. We should have
written long ago, but we knew nothing of his friends, and
there was nothing on him, nothing that anyone could under-
stand. He came in the train from Klausenburg, and the guard
was told by the station master there that he rushed into the
station shouting for a ticket for home. Seeing from his
violent demeanor that he was English, they gave him a ticket
for the furthest station on the way thither that the train
reached.

"Be assured that he is well cared for. He has won all
hearts by his sweetness and gentleness. He is truly getting
on well, and I have no doubt will in a few weeks be all him-
self. But be careful of him for safety's sake. There are, I
pray God and St. Joseph and Ste. Mary, many, many, happy years
for you both."

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


19 Agust.--Strange and sudden change in Renfield last
night. About eight o'clock he began to get excited and sniff
about as a dog does when setting. The attendant was struck
by his manner, and knowing my interest in him, encouraged
him to talk. He is usually respectful to the attendant and
at times servile, but tonight, the man tells me, he was
quite haughty. Would not condescend to talk with him at all.

All he would say was, "I don't want to talk to you. You
don't count now. The master is at hand."

The attendant thinks it is some sudden form of relig-
ious mania which has seized him. If so, we must look out for
squalls, for a strong man with homicidal and religious mania
at once might be dangerous. The combination is a dreadful one.

At Nine o'clock I visited him myself. His attitude to me
was the same as that to the attendant. In his sublime self-
feeling the difference between myself and the attendant
seemed to him as nothing. It looks like religious mania, and
he will soon think that he himself is God.

These infinitesimal distinctions between man and man
are too paltry for an Omnipotent Being. How these madmen give
themselves away! The real God taketh heed lest a sparrow
fall. But the God created from human vanity sees no differ-
ence between an eagle and a sparrow. Oh, if men only knew!

For half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited
in greater and greater degree. I did not pretend to be watch-
ing him, but I kept strict observation all the same. All at
once that shifty look came into his eyes which we always see
when a madman has seized an idea, and with it the shifty
movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come
to know so well. He became quite quiet, and went and sat on
the edge of his bed resignedly, and looked into space with
lack-luster eyes.

I thought I would find out if his apathy were real or
only assumed, and tried to lead him to talk of his pets, a
theme which had never failed to excite his attention.

At first he made no reply, but at length said testily,
"Bother them all! I don't care a pin about them."

"What" I said. "You don't mean to tell me you don't
care about spiders?" (Spiders at present are his hobby and
the notebook is filling up with columns of small figures.)

To this he answered enigmatically, "The Bride maidens
rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride. But
when the bride draweth nigh, then the maidens shine not to
the eyes that are filled."

He would not explain himself, but remained obstinately
seated on his bed all the time I remained with him.

I am weary tonight and low in spirits. I cannot but
think of Lucy, and how different things might have been. If
I don't sleep at once, chloral, the modern Morpheus! I must
be careful not to let it grow into a habit. No, I shall take
none tonight! I have thought of Lucy, and I shall not dis-
honour her by mixing the two. If need by, tonight shall be
sleepless.


Later.--Glad I made the resolution, gladder that I kept
to it. I had lain tossing about, and had heard the clock
strike only twice, when the night watchman came to me, sent
up from the ward, to say that Renfield had escaped. I threw
on my clothes and ran down at once. My patient is too dan-
gerous a person to be roaming about. Those ideas of his
might work out dangerously with strangers.

The attendant was waiting for me. He said he had seen
him not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in his bed, when
he had looked through the observation trap in the door. His
attention was called by the sound of the window being wrench-
ed out. He ran back and saw his feet disappear through the
window, and had at once sent up for me. He was only in his
night gear, and cannot be far off.

The attendant thought it would be more useful to watch
where he should go than to follow him, as he might lose sight
of him whilst getting out of the building by the door. He is
a bulky man, and couldn't get through the window.

I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet fore-
most, and as we were only a few feet above ground landed
unhurt.

The attendant told me the patient had gone to the left,
and had taken a straight line, so I ran as quickly as I
could. As I got through the belt of trees I saw a white
figure scale the high wall which separates our grounds from
those of the deserted house.

I ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or
four men immediately and follow me into the grounds of Car-
fax, in case our friend might be dangerous. I got a ladder
myself, and crossing the wall, dropped down on the other side.
I could see Renfield's figure just disappearing behind the
angle of the house, so I ran after him. On the far side of
the house I found him pressed close against the old iron-
bound oak door of the chapel.

He was talking, apparently to some one, but I was afraid
to go near enough to hear what he was saying, les t I might
frighten him, and he should run off.

Chasing an errant swarm of bees is nothing to following
a naked lunatic, when the fit of escaping is upon him! After
a few minutes, however, I could see that he did not take note
of anything around him, and so ventured to draw nearer to
him, the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were
closing him in. I heard him say. . .

"I am here to do your bidding, Master. I am your slave,
and you will reward me, for I shall be faithful. I have
worshipped you long and afar off. Now that you are near, I
await your commands, and you will not pass me by, will you,
dear Master, in your distribution of good things?"

He is a selfish old beggar anyhow. He thinks of the
loaves and fishes even when he believes his is in a real
Presence. His manias make a startling combination. When we
closed in on him he fought like a tiger. He is immensely
strong, for he was more like a wild beast than a man.

I never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before,
and I hope I shall not again. It is a mercy that we have
found out his strength and his danger in good time. With
strength and determination like his, he might have done wild
work before he was caged.

He is safe now, at any rate. Jack Sheppard himself
couldn't get free from the strait waistcoat that keeps him
restrained, and he's chained to the wall in the padded room.

His cries are at times awful, but the silences that
follow are more deadly still, for he means murder in every
turn and movement.

Just now he spoke coherent words for the first time. "I
shall be patient, Master. It is coming, coming, coming!"

So I took the hint, and came too. I was too excited to
sleep, but this diary has quieted me, and I feel I shall get
some sleep tonight.




CHAPTER 9


LETTER, MINA HARKER TO LUCY WESTENRA


Buda-Pesth, 24 August.

"My dearest Lucy,

"I know you will be anxious to hear all that has happ-
ened since we parted at the railway station at Whitby.

"Well, my dear, I got to Hull all right, and caught
the boat to Hamburg, and then the train on here. I feel
that I can hardly recall anything of the journey, except
that I knew I was coming to Jonathan, and that as I should
have to do some nursing, I had better get all the sleep I
could. I found my dear one, oh, so thin and pale and weak-
looking. All the resolution has gone out of his dear eyes,
and that quiet dignity which I told you was in his face has
vanished. He is only a wreck of himself, and he does not
remember anything that has happened to him for a long time
past. At least, he wants me to believe so, and I shall
never ask.

"He has had some terrible shock, and I fear it might
tax his poor brain if he were to try to recall it. Sister
Agatha, who is a good creature and a born nurse, tells me
that he wanted her to tell me what they were, but she would
only cross herself, and say she would never tell. That the
ravings of the sick were the secrets of God, and that if a
nurse through her vocation should hear them, she should re-
spect her trust..

"She is a sweet, good soul, and the next day, when she
saw I was troubled, she opened up the subject my poor dear
raved about, added, `I can tell you this much, my dear.
That it was not about anything which he has done wrong him-
self, and you, as his wife to be, have no cause to be con-
cerned. He has not forgotten you or what he owes to you.
His fear was of great and terrible things, which no mortal
can treat of.'

"I do believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous
lest my poor dear should have fallen in love with any other
girl. The idea of my being jealous about Jonathan! And yet,
my dear, let me whisper, I felt a thrill of joy through me
when I knew that no other woman was a cause for trouble. I
am now sitting by his bedside, where I can see his face while
he sleeps. He is waking!

"When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to
get something from the pocket. I asked Sister Agatha, and
she brought all his things. I saw amongst them was his note-
book, and was was going to ask him to let me look at it, for
I knew that I might find some clue to his trouble, but I sup-
pose he must have seen my wish in my eyes, for he sent me
over to the window, saying he wanted to be quite alone for a
moment.

"Then he called me back, and he said to me very solemnly,
`Wilhelmina', I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for
he has never called me by that name since he asked me to
marry him, `You know, dear, my ideas of the trust between
husband and wife. There should be no secret, no concealment.
I have had a great shock, and when I try to think of what it
is I feel my head spin round, and I do not know if it was
real of the dreaming of a madman. You know I had brain fever,
and that is to be mad. The secret is here, and I do not want
to know it. I want to take up my life here, with our marri-
age.' For, my dear, we had decided to be married as soon as
the formalities are complete. `Are you willing, Wilhelmina,
to share my ignorance? Here is the book. Take it and keep
it, read it if you will, but never let me know unless, indeed,
some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to the
bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.'
He fell back exhausted, and I put the book under his pillow,
and kissed him. have asked Sister Agatha to beg the Super-
ior to let our wedding be this afternoon, and am waiting her
reply. . ."


"She has come and told me that the Chaplain of the En-
glish mission church has been sent for. We are to be married
in an hour, or as soon after as Jonathan awakes."


"Lucy, the time has come and gone. I feel very solemn,
but very, very happy. Jonathan woke a little after the hour,
and all was ready, and he sat up in bed, propped up with
pillows. He answered his `I will' firmly and strong. I
could hardly speak. My heart was so full that even those
words seemed to choke me.

"The dear sisters were so kind. Please, God, I shall
never, never forget them, nor the grave and sweet respon-
sibilities I have taken upon me. I must tell you of my
wedding present. When the chaplain and the sisters had left
me alone with my husband--oh, Lucy, it is the first time I
have written the words `my husband'--left me alone with my
husband, I took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped
it up in white paper, and tied it with a little bit of pale
blue ribbon which was round my neck, and sealed it over the
knot with sealing wax, and for my seal I used my wedding
ring. Then I kissed it and showed it to my husband, and told
him that I would keep it so, and then it would be an outward
and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each
other, that I would never open it unless it were for his own
dear sake or for the sake of some stern duty. Then he took
my hand in his, and oh, Lucy, it was the first time he took
his wifes' hand, and said that it was the dearest thing in
all the wide world, and that he would go through all the past
again to win it, if need be. The poor dear meant to have said
a part of the past, but he cannot think of time yet, and I
shall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month,
but the year.

"Well, my dear, could I say? I could only tell him that
I was the happiest woman in all the wide world, and that I
had nothing to give him except myself, my life, and my trust,
and that with these went my love and duty for all the days
of my life. And, my dear, when he kissed me, and drew me to
him with his poor weak hands, it was like a solemn pledge
between us.


"Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this? It is
not only because it is all sweet to me, but because you have
been, and are, very dear to me. It was my privilege to be
your friend and guide when you came from the schoolroom to
prepare for the world of life. I want you to see now, and
with the eyes of a very happy wife, whither duty has led me,
so that in your own married life you too may be all happy,
as I am. My dear, please Almighty God, your life may be all
it promises, a long day of sunshine, with no harsh wind, no
forgetting duty, no distrust. I must not wish you no pain,
for that can never be, but I do hope you will be always as
happy as I am now. Goodbye, my dear. I shall post this at
once, and perhaps, write you very soon again. I must stop,
for Jonathan is waking. I must attend my husband!

"Your ever-loving
"Mina Harker."

LETTER, LUCY WESTENRA TO MINA HARKER.

Whitby, 30 August.

"My dearest Mina,

"Oceans of love and millions of kisses, and may you
soon be in your own home with your husband. I wish you were
coming home soon enough to stay with us here. The strong air
would soon restore Jonathan. It has quite restored me. I
have an appetite like a cormorant, am full of life, and sleep
well. You will be glad to know that I have quite given up
walking in my sleep. I think I have not stirred out of my
bed for a week, that is when I once got into it at night.
Arthur says I am getting fat. By the way, I forgot to tell
you that Arthur is here. We have such walks and drives, and
rides, and rowing, and tennis, and fishing together, and I
love him more than ever. He tells me that he loves me more,
but I doubt that, for at first he told me that he couldn't
love me more than he did then. But this is nonsense. There
he is, calling to me. So no more just at present from your
loving,

"Lucy.


"P.S.--Mother sends her love. She seems better, poor dear.

"P.P.S.--We are to be married on 28 September."

DR. SEWARDS DIARY


20 August.--The case of Renfield grows even more in-
teresting. He has now so far quieted that there are spells
of cessation from his passion. For the first week after his
attack he was perpetually violent. Then one night, just as
the moon rose, he grew quiet, and kept murmuring to himself.
"Now I can wait. Now I can wait."

The attendant came to tell me, so I ran down at once to
have a look at him. He was still in the strait waistcoat
and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gone from
his face, and his eyes had something of their old pleading.
I might almost say, cringing, softness. I was satisfied
with his present condition, and directed him to be relieved.
The attendants hesitated, but finally carried out my wishes
without protest.

It was a strange thing that the patient had humour
enough to see their distrust, for, coming close to me, he
said in a whisper, all the while looking furtively at them,
"They think I could hurt you! Fancy me hurting you! The
fools!"

It was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find my-
self disassociated even in the mind of this poor madman from
the others, but all the same I do not follow his thought. Am
I to take it that I have anything in common with him, so that
we are, as it were, to stand together. Or has he to gain from
me some good so stupendous that my well being is needful to
Him? I must find out later on. Tonight he will not speak.
Even the offer of a kitten or even a full-grown cat will not
tempt him.

He will only say, "I don't take any stock in cats. I
have more to think of now, and I can wait. I can wait."

After a while I left him. The attendant tells me that
he was quiet until just before dawn, and that then he began
to get uneasy, and at length violent, until at last he fell
into a paroxysm which exhausted him so that he swooned into
a sort of coma.


. . . Three nights has the same thing happened, violent
all day then quiet from moonrise to sunrise. I wish I could
get some clue to the cause. It would almost seem as if there
was some influence which came and went. Happy thought! We
shall tonight play sane wits against mad ones. He escaped
before without our help. Tonight he shall escape with it.
We shall give him a chance, and have the men ready to follow
in case they are required.


23 August.--"The expected always happens." How well
Disraeli knew life. Our bird when he found the cage open
would not fly, so all our subtle arrangements were for nought.
At any rate, we have proved one thing, that the spells of
quietness last a reasonable time. We shall in future be able
to ease his bonds for a few hours each day. I have given
orders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the pad-
ded room, when once he is quiet, until the hour before sun-
rise. The poor soul's body will enjoy the relief even if his
mind cannot appreciate it. Hark! The unexpected again! I
am called. The patient has once more escaped.


Later.--Another night adventure. Renfield artfully wait-
ed until the attendant was entering the room to inspect.
Then he dashed out past him and flew down the passage. I
sent word for the attendants to follow. Again he went into
the grounds of the deserted house, and we found him in the
same place, pressed against the old chapel door. When he saw
me he became furious, and had not the attendants seized him
in time, he would have tried to kill me. As we sere holding
him a strange thing happened. He suddenly redoubled his eff-
orts, and then as suddenly grew calm. I looked round instinc-
tively, but could see nothing. Then I caught the patient's
eye and followed it, but could trace nothing as it looked
into the moonlight sky, except a big bat, which was flapping
its silent and ghostly way to the west. Bats usually wheel
about, but this one seemed to go straight on, as if it knew
where it was bound for or had some intention of its own.

The patient grew calmer every instant, and presently
said, "You needn't tie me. I shall go quietly!" Without
trouble, we came back to the house. I feel there is some-
thing ominous in his calm, and shall not forget this night.



LUCY WESTENRA'S DIARY


Hillingham, 24 August.--I must imitate Mina, and keep
writing things down. Then we can have long talks when we do
meet. I wonder when it will be. I wish she were with me
again, for I feel so unhappy. Last night I seemed to be
dreaming again just as I was at Whitby. Perhaps it is the
change of air, or getting home again. It is all dark and
horrid to me, for I can remember nothing. But I am full of
vague fear, and I feel so weak and worn out. When Arthur
came to lunch he looked quite grieved when he saw me, and I
hadn't the spirit to try to be cheerful. I wonder if I could
sleep in mother's room tonight. I shall make an excuse to try.


25 August.--Another bad night. Mother did not seem to
take to my proposal. She seems not too well herself, and
doubtless she fears to worry me. I tried to keep awake, and
succeeded for a while, but when the clock struck twelve it
waked me from a doze, so I must have been falling asleep.
There was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window,
but I did not mind it, and as I remember no more, I suppose
I must have fallen asleep. More bad dreams. I wish I could
remember them. This morning I am horribly weak. My face is
ghastly pale, and my throat pains me. It must be something
wrong with my lungs, for I don't seem to be getting air
enough. I shall try to cheer up when Arthur comes, or else
I know he will be miserable to see me so.



LETTER, ARTHUR TO DR. SEWARD

"Albemarle Hotel, 31 August
"My dear Jack,

"I want you to do me a favour. Lucy is ill, that is she
has no special disease, but she looks awful, and is getting
worse every day. I have asked her if there is any cause, I
not dare to ask her mother, for to disturb the poor lady's
mind about her daughter in her present state of health would
be fatal. Mrs. Westenra has confided to me that her doom is
spoken, disease of the heart, though poor Lucy does not know
it yet. I am sure that there is something preying on my dear
girl's mind. I am almost distracted when I think of her. To
look at her gives me a pang. I told her I should ask you to
see her, and though she demurred at first, I know why, old
fellow, she finally consented. It will be a painful task for
you, I know, old friend, but it is for her sake, and I must
not hesitate to ask, or you to act. You are to come to lunch
at Hillingham tomorrow, two o'clock, so as not to arouse any
suspicion in Mrs. Westenra, and after lunch Lucy will take an
opportunity of being alone with you. I am filled with
anxiety, and want to consult with you alone as soon as I can
after you have seen her. Do not fail!

"Arthur."


TELEGRAM, ARTHUR HOLMWOOD TO SEWARD


1 September


"Am summoned to see my father, who is worse. Am writing.
Write me fully by tonight's post to Ring. Wire me if neces-
sary."

LETTER FROM DR. SEWARD TO ARTHUR HOLMWOOD


2 September

"My dear old fellow,

"With regard to Miss Westenra's health I hasten to let
you know at once that in my opinion there is not any funct-
al disturbance or any malady that I know of. At the same
time, I am not by any means satisfied with her appearance.
She is woefully different from what she was when I saw her
last. Of course you must bear in mind that I did not have
full opportunity of examination such as I should wish. Our
very friendship makes a little difficulty which not even
medical science or custom can bridge over. I had better tell
you exactly what happened, leaving you to draw, in a measure,
your own conclusions. I shall then say what I have done and
propose doing.

"I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits. Her
mother was present, and in a few seconds I made up my mind
that she was trying all she knew to mislead her mother and
prevent her from being anxious. I have no doubt she guesses,
if she does not know, what need of caution there is.

"We lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to
be cheerful, we got, as some kind of reward for our labours,
some real cheerfulness amongst us. Then Mrs. Westenra went
to lie down, and Lucy was left with me. We went into her
boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained, for the
servants were coming and going.

"As soon as the door was closed, however, the mask fell
from her face, and she sank down into a chair with a great
sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand. When I saw that her
high spirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her re-
action to make a diagnosis.

"She said to me very sweetly, `I cannot tell you how I
loathe talking about myself.' I reminded her that a doctor's
confidence was sacred, but that you were grievously anxious
about her. She caught on to my meaning at once, and settled
that matter in a word. `Tell Arthur everything you choose. I
do not care for myself, but for him!' So I am quite free.

"I could easily see that she was somewhat bloodless, but
I could not see the usual anemic signs, and by the chance , I
was able to test the actual quality of her blood, for in
opening a window which was stiff a cord gave way, and she cut
her hand slightly with broken glass. It was a slight matter
in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I secured
a few drops of the blood and have analysed them.

"The qualitative analysis give a quite normal condition,
and shows, I should infer, in itself a vigorous state of
health. In other physical matters I was quite satisfied that
there is no need for anxiety, but as there must be a cause
somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be
something mental.

"She complains of difficulty breathing satisfactorily
at times, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that
frighten her, but regarding which she can remember nothing.
She says that as a child, she used to walk in her sleep, and
that when in Whitby the habit came back, and that once she
walked out in the night and went to East Cliff, where Miss
Murray found her. But she assures me that of late the habit
has not returned.

"I am in doubt, and so have done the best thing I know
of. I have written to my old friend and master, Professor
Van Helsing, of Amsterdam, who knows as much about obscure
diseases as any one in the world. I have asked him to come
over, and as you told me that all things were to be at your
charge, I have mentioned to him who you are and your rela-
tions to Miss Westenra. This, my dear fellow, is in obed-
ience to your wishes, for I am only too proud and happy to
do anything I can for her.

"Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a
personal reason, so no matter on what ground he comes, we
must accept his wishes. He is a seemingly arbitrary man,
this is because he knows what he is talking about better
than any one else. He is a philosopher and a metaphysician,
and one of the most advanced scientists of his day, and he
has, I believe, an absolutely open mind. This, with an iron
nerve, a temper of the ice-brook, and indomitable resolution,
self-command, and toleration exalted from virtues to bless-
ings, and the kindliest and truest heart that beats, these
form his equipment for the noble work that he is doing for
mankind, work both in theory and practice, for his views are
as wide as his all-embracing sympathy. I tell you these facts
that you may know why I have such confidence in him. I have
asked him to come at once. I shall see Miss Westenra tomorrow
again. She is to meet me at the Stores, so that I may not
alarm her mother by too early a repetition of my call.

"Yours always."

John Seward




LETTER, ABRAHAM VAN HELSING, MD, DPh, D. LiT, ETC, ETC,
TO DR. SEWARD


2 September.

"My good Friend,

"When I received your letter I am already coming to you.
By good fortune I can leave just at once, without wrong to
any of those who have trusted me. Were fortune other, then
it were bad for those who have trusted, for I come to my
friend when he call me to aid those he holds dear. Tell your
friend that when that time you suck from my wound so swiftly
the poison of the gangrene from that knife that our other
friend, too nervous, let slip, you did more for him when he
wants my aids and you call for them than all his great for-
tune could do. But it is pleasure added to do for him, your
friend, it is to you that I come. Have near at hand, and
please it so arrange that we may see the young lady not too
late on tomorrow, for it is likely that I may have to return
here that night. But if need be I shall come again in three
days, and stay longer if it must. Till then goodbye, my
friend John.

"Van Helsing."

LETTER, DR. SEWARD TO HON. ARTHUR HOLMWOOD


3 September

"My dear Art,

"Van Helsing has come and gone. He came on with me to
Hillingham, and found that, by Lucy's discretion, her mother
was lunching out, so that we were alone with her.

"Van Helsing made a very careful examination of the
patient. He is to report to me, and I shall advise you, for
of course I was not present all the time. He is, I fear,
much concerned, but says he must think. When I told him of
our friendship and how you trust to me in the matter, he said,
`You must tell him all you think. Tell him him what I think,
if you can guess it, if you will. Nay, I am not jesting.
This is no jest, but life and death, perhaps more.' I asked
what he meant by that, for he was very serious. This was
when we had come back to town, and he was having a cup of tea
before starting on his return to Amsterdam. He would not give
me any further clue. You must not be angry with me, Art, be-
cause his very reticence means that all his brains are work-
ing for her good. He will speak plainly enough when the time
comes, be sure. So I told him I would simply write an account
of our visit, just as if I were doing a descriptive special
article for THE DAILY TELEGRAPH. He seemed not to notice, but
remarked that the smuts of London were not quite so bad as
they used to be when he was a student here. I am to get his
report tomorrow if he can possibly make it. In any case I
am to have a letter.

"Well, as to the visit, Lucy was more cheerful than on
the day I first saw her, and certainly looked better. She
had lost something of the ghastly look that so upset you, and
her breathing was normal. She was very sweet to the Professor
(as she always is), and tried to make him feel at ease, though
I could see the poor girl was making a hard struggle for it.

"I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quick
look under his bushy brows that I knew of old. Then he began
to chat of all things except ourselves and diseases and with
such an infinite geniality that I could see poor Lucy's pre-
tense of animation merge into reality. Then, without any
seeming change, he brought the conversation gently round to
his visit, and sauvely said,

"`My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure be-
cause you are so much beloved. That is much, my dear, even
were there that which I do not see. They told me you were
down in the spirit, and that you were of a ghastly pale. To
them I say "Pouf!" ' And he snapped his fingers at me and
went on. `But you and I shall show them how wrong they are.
How can he', and he pointed at me with the same look and
gesture as that with which he pointed me out in his class,
on, or rather after, a particular occasion which he never
fails to remind me of, `know anything of a young ladies? He
has his madmen to play with, and to bring them back to happi-
ness, and to those that love them. It is much to do, and,
oh, but there are rewards in that we can bestow such happi-
ness.  But the young ladies! He has no wife nor daughter, and
the young do not tell themselves to the young, but to the
old, like me, who have known so many sorrows and the causes
of them. So, my dear, we will send him away to smoke the cig-
arette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all
to ourselves.' I took the hint, and strolled about, and pre-
sently the professor came to the window and called me in. He
looked grave, but said, ` I have made careful examination,
but there is no functional cause. With you I agree that there
has been much blood lost, it has been but is not. But the
conditions of her are in no way anemic. I have asked her to
send me her maid, that I may ask just one or two questions,
that so I may not chance to miss nothing. I know well what
she will say. And yet there is cause. There is always cause
for everything. I must go back home and think. You must
send me the telegram every day, and if there be cause I shall
come again. The disease, for not to be well is a disease,
interest me, and the sweet, young dear, she interest me too.
She charm me, and for her, if not for you or disease, I
come.'

"As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when
we were alone. And so now, Art, you know all I know. I
shall keep stern watch. I trust your poor father is rallying.
It must be a terrible thing to you, my dear old fellow, to be
placed in such a position between two people who are both so
dear to you. I know your idea of duty to your father, and
you are right to stick to it. But if need be, I shall send
you word to come at once to Lucy, so do not be over-anxious
unless you hear from me."


DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


4 September.--Zoophagous patient still keeps up our
interest in him. He had only one outburst and that was yes-
terday at an unusual time. Just before the stroke of noon
he began to grow restless. The attendant knew the symptoms,
and at once summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at a run,
and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became so
violent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about
five minutes, however, he began to get more quiet, and finally
sank into a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remain-
ed up to now. The attendant tells me that his screams whilst
in the paroxysm were really appalling. I found my hands full
when I got in, attending to some of the other patients who
were frightened by him. Indeed, I can quite understand the
effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I was some
distance away. It is now after the dinner hour of the asylum,
and as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull,
sullen, woe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to
indicate than to show something directly. I cannot quite
understand it.


Later.--Another change in my patient. At five o'clock
I looked in on him, and found him seemingly as happy and
contented as he used to be. He was catching flies and eating
them, and was keeping note of his capture by making nailmarks
on the edge of the door between the ridges of padding. When
he saw me, he came over and apologized for his bad conduct,
and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back
to his own room, and to have his notebook again. I thought it
well to humour him, so he is back in his room with the window
open. He has the sugar of his tea spread out on the window
sill, and is reaping quite a harvest of flies. He is not now
eating them, but putting them into a box, as of old, and is
already examining the corners of his room to find a spider. I
tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for any
clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me, but he
would not rise. For a moment or two he looked very sad, and
said in a sort of far away voice, as though saying it rather
to himself than to me.

"All over! All over! He has deserted me. No hope for
me now unless I do it myself!" Then suddenly turning to me
in a resolute way, he said, "Doctor, won't you be very good to
me and let me have a little more sugar? I think it would be
very good for me."

"And the flies?" I said.

"Yes! The flies like it, too, and I like the flies,
therefore I like it."And there are people who know so little
as to think that madmen do not argue. I procured him a double
supply, and left him as happy a man as, I suppose, any in the
world. I wish I could fathom his mind.


Midnight.--Another change in him. I had been to see Miss
Westenra, whom I found much better, and had just returned,
and was standing at our own gate looking at the sunset, when
once more I heard him yelling.  As his room is on this side of
the house, I could hear it better than in the morning. It
was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky beauty of
a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadows
and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even
as on foul water, and to realize all the grim sternness of my
own cold stone building, with its wealth of breathing misery,
and my own desolate heart to endure it all. I reached him
just as the sun was going down, and from his window saw the
red disc sink. As it sank he became less and less frenzied,
and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him,
an inert mass, on the floor. It is wonderful, however, what
intellectual recuperative power lunatics have, for within a
few minutes he stood up quite calmly and looked around him.
I signalled to the attendants not to hold him, for I was
anxious to see what he would do. He went straight over to
the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar. Then he
took his fly box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the
box. Then he shut the window, and crossing over, sat down on
his bed.  All this surprised me, so I asked him, "Are you going
to keep flies any more?"

"No," said he. "I am sick of all that rubbish!" He
certainly is a wonderfully interesting study. I wish I could
get some glimpse of his mind or of the cause of his sudden
passion. Stop. There may be a clue after all, if we can find
why today his paroxysms came on at high noon and at sunset.
Can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun at
periods which affects certain natures, as at times the moon
does others? We shall see.

LETTER, DR. SEWARD TO HON. ARTHUR HOLMWOOD


6 September

"My dear Art,

"My news today is not so good. Lucy this morning had
gone back a bit. There is, however, one good thing which has
arisen from it. Mrs. Westenra was naturally anxious concern-
ing Lucy, and has consulted me professionally about her. I
took advantage of the opportunity, and told her that my old
master, Van Helsing, the great specialist, was coming to stay
with me, and that I would put her in his charge conjointly
with myself. So now we can come and go without alarming her
unduly, for a shock to her would mean sudden death, and this,
in Lucy's weak condition, might be disastrous to her. We are
hedged in with difficulties, all of us, my poor fellow, but,
please God, we shall come through them all right. If any need
I shall write, so that, if you do not hear from me, take it
for granted that I am simply waiting for news, In haste,

"Yours ever,"

John Seward



DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


7 September.--The first thing Van Helsing said to me
when we met at Liverpool Street was, "Have you said anything
to our young friend, to lover of her?"

"No," I said. "I waited till I had seen you, as I said
in my telegram. I wrote him a letter simply telling him that
you were coming, as Miss Westenra was not so well, and that I
should let him know if need be."

"Right, my friend," he said. "Quite right! Better he
not know as yet. Perhaps he will never know. I pray so, but
if it be needed, then he shall know all. And, my good friend
John, let me caution you. You deal with the madmen. All men
are mad in some way or the other, and inasmuch as you deal
discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God's madmen too,
the rest of the world. You tell not your madmen what you do
nor why you do it. You tell them not what you think. So
you shall keep knowledge in its place, where it may rest,
where it may gather its kind around it and breed. You and I
shall keep as yet what we know here, and here." He touched
me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched him-
self the same way. "I have for myself thoughts at the pre-
sent. Later I shall unfold to you."

"Why not now?" I asked. "It may do some good. We may
arrive at some decision."He looked at me and said, "My friend
John, when the corn is grown, even before it has ripened,
while the milk of its mother earth is in him, and the sun-
shine has not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the hus-
bandman he pull the ear and rub him between his rough hands,
and blow away the green chaff, and say to you, 'Look! He's
good corn, he will make a good crop when the time comes.' "

I did not see the application and told him so. For
reply he reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled
it playfully, as he used long ago to do at lectures, and said,
"The good husbandman tell you so then because he knows, but
not till then. But you do not find the good husbandman dig
up his planted corn to see if he grow. That is for the
children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take
it as of the work of their life. See you now, friend John?
I have sown my corn, and Nature has her work to do in making
it sprout, if he sprout at all, there's some promise, and I
wait till the ear begins to swell." He broke off, for he
evidently saw that I understood. Then he went on gravely,
"You were always a careful student, and your case book was
ever more full than the rest. And I trust that good habit
have not fail. Remember, my friend, that knowledge is
stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker.
Even if you have not kept the good practice, let me tell you
that this case of our dear miss is one that may be, mind, I
say may be, of such interest to us and others that all the
rest may not make him kick the beam, as your people say.
Take then good note of it. Nothing is too small. I counsel
you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises. Here-
after it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess.
We learn from failure, not from success!"

When I described Lucy's symptoms, the same as before,
but infinitely more marked, he looked very grave, but said
nothing. He took with him a bag in which were many instru-
ments and drugs, "the ghastly paraphernalia of our bene-
ficial trade," as he once called, in one of his lectures,
the equipment of a professor of the healing craft.

When we were shown in, Mrs. Westenra met us. She was
alarmed, but not nearly so much as I expected to find her.
Nature in one of her beneficient moods has ordained that
even death has some antidote to its own terrors. Here, in
a case where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so order-
ed that, from some cause or other, the things not personal,
even the terrible change in her daughter to whom she is so
attached, do not seem to reach her. It is something like
the way dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an enve-
lope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil
that which it would otherwise harm by contact. If this be
an ordered selfishness, then we should pause before we con-
demn any one for the vice of egoism, for there may be deeper
root for its causes than we have knowledge of.

I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual patho-
logy, and set down a rule that she should not be present
with Lucy, or think of her illness more than was absolutely
required. She assented readily, so readily that I saw again
the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were
shown up to Lucy's room. If I was shocked when I saw her
yesterday, I was horrified when I saw her today.

She was ghastly, chalkily pale. The red seemed to have
gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of her face
stood out prominently. Her breathing was painful to see or
hear. Van Helsing's face grew set as marble, and his eye-
brows converged till they almost touched over his nose. Lucy
lay motionless, and did not seem to have strength to speak,
so for a while we were all silent. Then Van Helsing beckon-
ed to me, and we went gently out of the room. The instant
we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage
to the next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly
in with him and closed the door. "My god!" he said. "This
is dreadful. There is not time to be lost. She will die
for sheer want of blood to keep the heart's action as it
should be. There must be a transfusion of blood at once. Is
it you or me?"

"I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me."

"Then get ready at once. I will bring up my bag. I am
prepared."

I went downstairs with him, and as we were going there
was a knock at the hall door. When we reached the hall, the
maid had just opened the door, and Arthur was stepping
quickly in. He rushed up to me, saying in an eager whisper,

"Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of
your letter, and have been in an agony. The dad was better,
so I ran down here to see for myself. Is not that gentleman
Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful to you, sir, for coming."

When first the Professor's eye had lit upon him, he had
been angry at his interruption at such a time, but now, as
he took in his stalwart proportions and recognized the
strong young manhood which seemed to emanate from him, his
eyes gleamed. Without a pause he said to him as he held out
his hand,

"Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our
dear miss. She is bad, very, very bad. Nay, my child, do
not go like that."For he suddenly grew pale and sat down in
a chair almost fainting. "You are to help her. You can do
more than any that live, and your courage is your best help."

"What can I do?" asked Arthur hoarsely. "Tell me, and
I shall do it. My life is hers' and I would give the last
drop of blood in my body for her."

The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could
from old knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his
answer.

"My young sir, I do not ask so much as that, not the
last!"

"What shall I do?" There was fire in his eyes, and his
open nostrils quivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him
on the shoulder.

"Come!" he said. "You are a man, and it is a man we
want. You are better than me, better than my friend John."
Arthur looked bewildered, and the Professor went on by ex-
plaining in a kindly way.

"Young miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, and
blood she must have or die. My friend John and I have con-
sulted, and we are about to perform what we call transfusion
of blood, to transfer from full veins of one to the empty
veins which pine for him. John was to give his blood, as he
is the more young and strong than me."--Here Arthur took my
hand and wrung it hard in silence.--"But now you are here,
you are more good than us, old or young, who toil much in
the world of thought. Our nerves are not so calm and our
blood so bright than yours!"

Arthur turned to him and said, "If you only knew how
gladly I would die for her you would understand. . ." He
stopped with a sort of choke in his voice.

"Good boy!" said Van Helsing. "In the not-so-far-off
you will be happy that you have done all for her you love.
Come now and be silent. You shall kiss her once before it
is done, but then you must go, and you must leave at my
sign. Say no word to Madame. You know how it is with her.
There must be no shock, any knowledge of this would be one.
Come!"

We all went up to Lucy's room. Arthur by direction re-
mained outside. Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but
said nothing. She was not asleep, but she was simply too
weak to make the effort. Her eyes spoke to us, that was all.

Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid
them on a little table out of sight. Then he mixed a nar-
cotic, and coming over to the bed, said cheerily, "Now,
little miss, here is your medicine. Drink it off, like a
good child. See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy.
Yes." She had made the effort with success.

It astonished me how long the drug took to act. This,
in fact, marked the extent of her weakness. The time seemed
endless until sleep began to flicker in her eyelids. At
last, however, the narcotic began to manifest its potency,
and she fell into a deep sleep. When the Professor was sat-
isfied, he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip
off his coat. Then he added, "You may take that one little
kiss whiles I bring over the table. Friend John, help to
me!" So neither of us looked whilst he bent over her.

Van Helsing, turning to me, said, "He is so young and
strong, and of blood so pure that we need not defibrinate
it."

Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Hel-
sing performed the operation. As the transfusion went on,
something like life seemed to come back to poor Lucy's
cheeks, and through Arthur's growing pallor the joy of his
face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to
grow anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur,
strong man as he was. It gave me an idea of what a terrible
strain Lucy's system must have undergone that what weakened
Arthur only partially restored her.

But the Professor's face was set, and he stood watch in
hand, and with his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on
Arthur. I could hear my own heart beat. Presently, he said
in a soft voice, "Do not stir an instant. It is enough. You
attend him. I will look to her."

When all was over, I could see how much Arthur was weak-
ened. I dressed the wound and took his arm to bring him
away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round, the man
seems to have eyes in the back of his head, "The brave lover,
I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have present-
ly." And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted
the pillow to the patient's head. As he did so the narrow
black velvet band which she seems always to wear round her
throat, buckled with an old diamond buckle which her lover
had given her, was dragged a little up, and showed a red
mark on her throat.

Arthur did not notice it, but I could hear the deep
hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing's ways
of betraying emotion. He said nothing at the moment, but
turned to me, saying, "Now take down our brave young lover,
give him of the port wine, and let him lie down a while. He
must then go home and rest, sleep much and eat much, that he
may be recruited of what he has so given to his love. He
must not stay here. Hold a moment! I may take it, sir, that
you are anxious of result. Then bring it with you, that in
all ways the operation is successful. You have saved her
life this time, and you can go home and rest easy in mind
that all that can be is. I shall tell her all when she is
well. She shall love you none the less for what you have
done. Goodbye."

When Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucy
was sleeping gently, but her breathing was stronger. I
could see the counterpane move as her breast heaved. By
the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently. The
velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Pro-
fessor in a whisper, "What do you make of that mark on her
throat?"

"What do you make of it?"

"I have not examined it yet," I answered, and then and
there proceeded to loose the band. Just over the external
jugular vein there were two punctures, not large, but not
wholesome looking. There was no sign of disease, but the
edges were white and worn looking, as if by some trituration.
It at once occurred to me that that this wound, or whatever
it was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood.
But I abandoned the idea as soon as it formed, for such a
thing could not be. The whole bed would have been drenched
to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must have lost
to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion.

"Well?" said Van Helsing.

"Well," said I. "I can make nothing of it."

The Professor stood up. "I must go back to Amsterdam
tonight," he said "There are books and things there which
I want. You must remain here all night, and you must not
let your sight pass from her."

"Shall I have a nurse?" I asked.

"We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all
night. See that she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs
her. You must not sleep all the night. Later on we can sleep,
you and I. I shall be back as soon as possible. And then
we may begin."

"May begin?" I said. "What on earth do you mean?"

"We shall see!" he answered, as he hurried out. He came
back a moment later and put his head inside the door and
said with a warning finger held up, "Remember, she is your
charge. If you leave her, and harm befall, you shall not
sleep easy hereafter!"


DR. SEWARD'S DIARY--CONTINUED


8 September.--I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiate
worked itself off towards dusk, and she waked naturally. She
looked a different being from what she had been before the
operation. Her spirits even were good, and she was full of a
happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of the absolute
prostration which she had undergone. When I told Mrs. West-
enra that Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up
with her, she almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her
daughter's renewed strength and excellent spirits. I was
firm, however, and made preparations for my long vigil. When
her maid had prepared her for the night I came in, having in
the meantime had supper, and took a seat by the bedside.

She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me
gratefully whenever I caught her eye.  After a long spell she
seemed sinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to
pull herself together and shook it off. It was apparent that
she did not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once.

"You do not want to sleep?"

"No. I am afraid."

"Afraid to go to sleep! Why so? It is the boon we all
crave for."

"Ah, not if you were like me, if sleep was to you a pre-
sage of horror!"

"A presage of horror! What on earth do you mean?"

"I don't know. Oh, I don't know. And that is what is
so terrible. All this weakness comes to me in sleep, until
I dread the very thought."

"But, my dear girl, you may sleep tonight. I am here
watching you, and I can promise that nothing will happen."

"Ah, I can trust you!" she said.

I seized the opportunity, and said, "I promise that if
I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once."

"You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me.
Then I will sleep!" And almost at the word she gave a deep
sigh of relief, and sank back, asleep.

All night long I watched by her. She never stirred, but
slept on and on in a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-
giving sleep. Her lips were slightly parted, and her breast
rose and fell with the regularity of a pendulum. There was
a smile on her face, and it was evident that no bad dreams
had come to disturb her peace of mind.

In the early morning her maid came, and I left her in
her care and took myself back home, for I was anxious about
many things. I sent a short wire to Van Helsing and to
Arthur, telling them of the excellent result of the opera-
tion. My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me all
day to clear off. It was dark when I was able to inquire
about my zoophagous patient. The report was good. He had
been quite quiet for the past day and night. A telegram
came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilst I was at dinner,
suggesting that I should be at Hillingham tonight, as it
might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was leav-
ing by the night mail and would join me early in the morn-
ing.


9 September.--I was pretty tired and worn out when I
got to Hillingham. For two nights I had hardly had a wink
of sleep, and my brain was beginning to feel that numbness
which marks cerebral exhaustion. Lucy was up and in cheer-
ful spirits. When she shook hands with me she looked sharp-
ly in my face and said,

"No sitting up tonight for you. You are worn out. I
am quite well again. Indeed, I am, and if there is to be any
sitting up, it is I who will sit up with you."

I would not argue the point, but went and had my supper.
Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence,
I made an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the
more than excellent port. Then Lucy took me upstairs, and
showed me a room next her own, where a cozy fire was burning.

"Now," she said. "You must stay here. I shall leave
this door open and my door too. You can lie on the sofa for
I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go
to bed whilst there is a patient above the horizon. If I
want anything I shall call out, and you can come to me at
once."

I could not but acquiesce, for I was dog tired, and
could not have sat up had I tried. So, on her renewing her
promise to call me if she should want anything, I lay on the
sofa, and forgot all about everything.

LUCY WESTENRA'S DIARY


9 September.--I feel so happy tonight. I have been so
miserably weak, that to be able to think and move about is
like feeling sunshine after a long spell of east wind out
of a steel sky. Somehow Arthur feels very, very close to me.
I seem to feel his presence warm about me. I suppose it is
that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our
inner eyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and
strength give love rein, and in thought and feeling he can
wander where he wills. I know where my thoughts are. If
only Arthur knew! My dear, my dear, your ears must tingle
as you sleep, as mine do waking. Oh, the blissful rest of
last night! How I slept, with that dear, good Dr. Seward
watching me. And tonight I shall not fear to sleep, since
he is close at hand and within call. Thank everybody for
being so good to me. Thank God! Goodnight Arthur.

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


10 September.--I was conscious of the Professor's hand
on my head, and started awake all in a second. That is one
of the things that we learn in an asylum, at any rate.

"And how is our patient?"

"Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me," I
answered.

"Come, let us see," he said. And together we went into
the room.

The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently,
whilst Van Helsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread,
over to the bed.

As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flood-
ed the room, I heard the Professor's low hiss of inspiration,
and knowing its rarity, a deadly fear shot through my heart.
As I passed over he moved back, and his exclamation of
horror, "Gott in Himmel!" needed no enforcement from his
agonized face. He raised his hand and pointed to the bed,
and his iron face was drawn and ashen white. I felt my knees
begin to tremble.

There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy,
more horribly white and wan-looking than ever. Even the
lips were white, and the gums seemed to have shrunken back
from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a corpse after a pro-
longed illness.

Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp in anger, but the
instinct of his life and all the long years of habit stood
to him, and he put it down again softly.

"Quick!" he said. "Bring the brandy."

I flew to the dining room, and returned with the de-
canter. He wetted the poor white lips with it, and together
we rubbed palm and wrist and heart. He felt her heart, and
after a few moments of agonizing suspense said,

"It is not too late. It beats, though but feebly. All
our work is undone. We must begin again. There is no young
Arthur here now. I have to call on you yourself this time,
friend John." As he spoke, he was dipping into his bag, and
producing the instruments of transfusion. I had taken off my
coat and rolled up my shirt sleeve. There was no possibility
of an opiate just at present, and no need of one. and so,
without a moment's delay, we began the operation.

After a time, it did not seem a short time either, for
the draining away of one's blood, no matter how willingly
it be given, is a terrible feeling, Van Helsing held up a
warning finger. "Do not stir," he said. "But I fear that
with growing strength she may wake, and that would make
danger, oh, so much danger. But I shall precaution take. I
shall give hypodermic injection of morphia." He proceeded
then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his intent.

The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed
to merge subtly into the narcotic sleep. It was with a
feeling of personal pride that I could see a faint tinge of
color steal back into the pallid cheeks and lips. No man
knows, till he experiences it, what it is to feel his own
lifeblood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.

The Professor watched me critically. "That will do,"
he said. "Already?" I remonstrated. "You took a great
deal more from Art." To which he smiled a sad sort of smile
as he replied,

"He is her lover, her fiance. You have work, much work
to do for her and for others, and the present will suffice.

When we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy,
whilst I applied digital pressure to my own incision. I laid
down, while I waited his leisure to attend to me, for I felt
faint and a little sick.  By and by he bound up my wound, and
sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for myself. As I
was leaving the room, he came after me, and half whispered.

"Mind, nothing must be said of this. If our young lover
should turn up unexpected, as before, no word to him. It
would at once frighten him and enjealous him, too. There
must be none. So!"

When I came back he looked at me carefully, and then
said, "You are not much the worse. Go into the room, and
lie on your sofa, and rest awhile, then have much breakfast
and come here to me."

I followed out his orders, for I knew how right and
wise they were. I had done my part, and now my next duty
was to keep up my strength. I felt very weak, and in the
weakness lost something of the amazement at what had occur-
red. I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over
and over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement,
and how she could have been drained of so much blood with
no sign any where to show for it. I think I must have con-
tinued my wonder in my dreams, for, sleeping and waking my
thoughts always came back to the little punctures in her
throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their edges,
tiny though they were.

Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was
fairly well and strong, though not nearly so much so as the
day before. When Van Helsing had seen her, he went out for
a walk, leaving me in charge, with strict injunctions that
I was not to leave her for a moment. I could hear his voice
in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.

Lucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite uncon-
scious that anything had happened. I tried to keep her
amused and interested. When her mother came up to see her,
she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but said to
me gratefully,

"We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done,
but you really must now take care not to overwork yourself.
You are looking pale yourself. You want a wife to nurse
and look after you a bit, that you do!" As she spoke, Lucy
turned crimson, though it was only momentarily, for her poor
wasted veins could not stand for long an unwonted drain to
the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as she
turned imploring eyes on me. I smiled and nodded, and laid
my finger on my lips. With a sigh, she sank back amid her
pillows.

Van Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and present-
ly said to me. "Now you go home, and eat much and drink
enough. Make yourself strong. I stay here tonight, and I
shall sit up with little miss myself. You and I must watch
the case, and we must have none other to know. I have grave
reasons. No, do not ask the. Think what you will. Do not
fear to think even the most not-improbable. Goodnight."

In the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if
they or either of them might not sit up with Miss Lucy. They
implored me to let them, and when I said it was Dr. Van
Helsing's wish that either he or I should sit up, they asked
me quite piteously to intercede with the`foreign gentleman'.
I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is because
I am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy's
account, that their devotion was manifested. For over and
over again have I seen similar instances of woman's kind-
ness. I got back here in time for a late dinner, went my
rounds, all well, and set this down whilst waiting for sleep.
It is coming.


11 September.--This afternoon I went over to Hilling-
ham. Found Van Helsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much
better. Shortly after I had arrived, a big parcel from
abroad came for the Professor. He opened it with much im-
pressment, assumed, of course, and showed a great bundle of
white flowers.

"These are for you, Miss Lucy," he said.

"For me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!"

"Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are
medicines." Here Lucy made a wry face. "Nay, but they are
not to take in a decoction or in nauseous form, so you need
not snub that so charming nose, or I shall point out to my
friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing so
much beauty that he so loves so much distort.  Aha, my pretty
miss, that bring the so nice nose all straight again. This
is medicinal, but you do not know how. I put him in your
window, I make pretty wreath, and hang him round your neck,
so you sleep well. Oh, yes! They, like the lotus flower,
make your trouble forgotten. It smell so like the waters of
Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores
sought for in the Floridas, and find him all too late."

Whilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the
flowers and smelling them. Now she threw them down saying,
with half laughter, and half disgust,

"Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a
joke on me. Why, these flowers are only common garlic."

To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all
his sternness, his iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows
meeting,

"No trifling with me! I never jest! There is grim
purpose in what I do, and I warn you that you do not thwart
me. Take care, for the sake of others if not for your own."
Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might well be, he went
on more gently, "Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear me.
I only do for your good, but there is much virtue to you
in those so common flowers. See, I place them myself in
your room. I make myself the wreath that you are to wear.
But hush! No telling to others that make so inquisitive
questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of obed-
ience, and obedience is to bring you strong and well into
loving arms that wait for you. Now sit still a while. Come
with me, friend John, and you shall help me deck the room
with my garlic, which is all the war from Haarlem, where my
friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass houses all the
year. I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have
been here."

We went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The
Professor's actions were certainly odd and not to be found
in any pharmacopeia that I ever heard of. First he fasten-
ed up the windows and latched them securely. Next, taking
a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over the sashes,
as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get
in would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp
he rubbed all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and
at each side, and round the fireplace in the same way. It
all seemed grotesque to me, and presently I said, "Well,
Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do,
but this certainly puzzles me. It is well we have no scep-
tic here, or he would say that you were working some spell
to keep out an evil spirit."

"Perhaps I am!" He answered quietly as he began to
make the wreath which Lucy was to wear round her neck.

We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the
night, and when she was in bed he came and himself fixed
the wreath of garlic round her neck. The last words he said
to her were,

"Take care you do not disturb it, and even if the room
feel close, do not tonight open the window or the door."

"I promise," said Lucy. "And thank you both a thousand
times for all your kindness to me! Oh, what have I done to
be blessed with such friends?"

As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van
Helsing said, "Tonight I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want,
two nights of travel, much reading in the day between, and
much anxiety on the day to follow, and a night to sit up,
without to wink. Tomorrow in the morning early you call for
me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much
more strong for my `spell' which I have work. Ho, ho!"

He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own con-
fidence two nights before and with the baneful result, felt
awe and vague terror. It must have been my weakness that
made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, but I felt it all
the more, like unshed tears.





CHAPTER 11


LUCY WESTENRA'S DIARY


12 September.--How good they all are to me. I quite
love that dear Dr. Van Helsing. I wonder why he was so
anxious about these flowers. He positively frightened me,
he was so fierce. And yet he must have been right, for I
feel comfort from them already. Somehow, I do not dread
being alone tonight, and I can go to sleep without fear. I
shall not mind any flapping outside the window. Oh, the
terrible struggle that I have had against sleep so often of
late, the pain of sleeplessness, or the pain of the fear of
sleep, and with such unknown horrors as it has for me! How
blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no dreads,
to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings
nothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I am tonight, hoping for
sleep, and lying like Ophelia in the play, with`virgin crants
and maiden strewments.' I never liked garlic before, but to-
night it is delightful! There is peace in its smell. I feel
sleep coming already. Goodnight, everybody.

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


13 September.--Called at the Berkeley and found Van
Helsing, as usual, up to time. The carriage ordered from
the hotel was waiting. The Professor took his bag, which he
always brings with him now.

Let all be put down exactly. Van Helsing and I arrived
at Hillingham at eight o'clock. It was a lovely morning. The
bright sunshine and all the fresh feeling of early autumn
seemed like the completion of nature's annual work. The
leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colors, but had
not yet begun to drop from the trees. When we entered we met
Mrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room. She is always
an early riser. She greeted us warmly and said,

"You will be glad to know that Lucy is better. The
dear child is still asleep. I looked into her room and saw
her, but did not go in, lest I should disturb her." The
Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. He rubbed his
hands together, and said, "Aha! I thought I had diagnosed
the case. My treatment is working."

To which she replied, "You must not take all the credit
to yourself, doctor. Lucy's state this morning is due in
part to me."

"How do you mean, ma'am?" asked the Professor.

"Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night,
and went into her room. She was sleeping soundly, so soundly
that even my coming did not wake her. But the room was aw-
fully stuffy. There were a lot of those horrible, strong-
smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually a
bunch of them round her neck. I feared that the heavy odor
would be too much for the dear child in her weak state, so
I took them all away and opened a bit of the window to let
in a little fresh air. You will be pleased with her, I am
sure."

She moved off into her boudoir, where she usually break-
fasted early. As she had spoken, I watched the Professor's
face, and saw it turn ashen gray. He had been able to retain
his self-command whilst the poor lady was present, for he
knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be. He
actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to
pass into her room. But the instant she had disappeared he
pulled me, suddenly and forcibly, into the dining room and
closed the door.

Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing
break down. He raised his hands over his head in a sort of
mute despair, and then beat his palms together in a helpless
way. Finally he sat down on a chair, and putting his hands
before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs that seem-
ed to come from the very racking of his heart.

Then he raised his arms again, as though appealing to
the whole universe. "God! God! God!" he said. "What have
we done, what has this poor thing done, that we are so sore
beset? Is there fate amongst us still, send down from the
pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such
way? This poor mother, all unknowing, and all for the best
as she think, does such thing as lose her daughter body and
soul, and we must not tell her, we must not even warn her,
or she die, then both die. Oh, how we are beset! How are
all the powers of the devils against us!"

Suddenly he jumped to his feet. "Come," he said."come,
we must see and act. Devils or no devils, or all the devils
at once, it matters not. We must fight him all the same." He
went to the hall door for his bag, and together we went up to
Lucy's room.

Once again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went
towards the bed. This time he did not start as he looked on
the poor face with the same awful, waxen pallor as before. He
wore a look of stern sadness and infinite pity.

"As I expected," he murmured, with that hissing inspir-
ation of his which meant so much. Without a word he went and
locked the door, and then began to set out on the little
table the instruments for yet another operation of transfu-
sion of blood. I had long ago recognized the necessity, and
begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with a warning
hand. "No!" he said. "Today you must operate. I shall pro-
vide. You are weakened already." As he spoke he took off
his coat and rolled up his shirtsleeve.

Again the operation. Again the narcotic. Again some
return of color to the ashy cheeks, and the regular breath-
ing of healthy sleep. This time I watched whilst Van Helsing
recruited himself and rested.

Presently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. West-
enra that she must not remove anything from Lucy's room
without consulting him. That the flowers were of medicinal
value, and that the breathing of their odor was a part of
the system of cure. Then he took over the care of the case
himself, saying that he would watch this night and the next,
and would send me word when to come.

After another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh
and bright and seemingly not much the worse for her ter-
rible ordeal.

What does it all mean? I am beginning to wonder if my
long habit of life amongst the insane is beginning to tell
upon my own brain.

LUCY WESTENRA'S DIARY


17 September.--Four days and nights of peace. I am
getting so strong again that I hardly know myself. It is as
if I had passed through some long nightmare, and had just
awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and feel the fresh
air of the morning around me. I have a dim half remem-
brance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing, dark-
ness in which there was not even the pain of hope to make
present distress more poignant. And then long spells of
oblivion, and the rising back to life as a diver coming up
through a great press of water. Since, however, Dr. Van
Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems to
have passed away. The noises that used to frighten me out
of my wits, the flapping against the windows, the distant
voices which seemed so close to me, the harsh sounds that
came from I know not where and commanded me to do I know
not what, have all ceased. I go to bed now without any fear
of sleep. I do not even try to keep awake. I have grown
quite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every
day from Haarlem. Tonight Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as
he has to be for a day in Amsterdam. But I need not be
watched. I am well enough to be left alone.

Thank God for Mother's sake, and dear Arthur's, and for
all our friends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel
the change, for last night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair
a lot of the time. I found him asleep twice when I awoke.
But I did not fear to go to sleep again, although the boughs
or bats or something flapped almost angrily against the
window panes.




THE PALL MALL GAZETTE 18 September.

THE ESCAPED WOLF
PERILOUS ADVENTURE OF OUR INTERVIEWER

INTERVIEW WITH THE KEEPER IN THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS


After many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and
perpetually using the words `PALL MALL GAZETTE ' as a sort
of talisman, I managed to find the keeper of the section of
the Zoological Gardens in which the wold department is in-
cluded. Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages in the
enclosure behind the elephant house, and was just sitting
down to his tea when I found him. Thomas and his wife are
hospitable folk, elderly, and without children, and if the
specimen I enjoyed of their hospitality be of the average
kind, their lives must be pretty comfortable. The keeper
would not enter on what he called business until the supper
was over, and we were all satisfied. Then when the table was
cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said,

"Now, Sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want.
You'll excoose me refoosin' to talk of perfeshunal subjucts
afore meals. I gives the wolves and the jackals and the
hyenas in all our section their tea afore I begins to arsk
them questions."

"How do you mean, ask them questions?" I queried, wish-
ful to get him into a talkative humor.

" `Ittin' of them over the `ead with a pole is one way.
Scratchin' of their ears in another, when gents as is flush
wants a bit of a show-orf to their gals. I don't so much
mind the fust, the `ittin of the pole part afore I chucks in
their dinner, but I waits till they've `ad their sherry and
kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with the ear scratchin'.
Mind you," he added philosophically, "there's a deal of the
same nature in us as in them theer animiles. Here's you
a-comin' and arskin' of me questions about my business, and
I that grump-like that only for your bloomin' `arf-quid I'd
`a' seen you blowed fust `fore I'd answer. Not even when
you arsked me sarcastic like if I'd like you to arsk the
Superintendent if you might arsk me questions. Without
offence did I tell yer to go to `ell?"

"You did."

"An' when you said you'd report me for usin' obscene
language that was `ittin' me over the `ead. But the `arf-
quid made that all right. I weren't a-goin' to fight, so I
waited for the food, and did with my `owl as the wolves and
lions and tigers does. But, lor' love yer `art, now that the
old `ooman has stuck a chunk of her tea-cake in me, an'
rinsed me out with her bloomin' old teapot, and I've lit hup,
you may scratch my ears for all you're worth, and won't even
get a growl out of me. Drive along with your questions. I
know what yer a-comin' at, that `ere escaped wolf."

"Exactly. I want you to give me your view of it. Just
tell me how it happened, and when I know the facts I'll get
you to say what you consider was the cause of it, and how
you think the whole affair will end."

"All right, guv'nor. This `ere is about the `ole story.
That`ere wolf what we called Bersicker was one of three gray
ones that came from Norway to Jamrach's, which we bought off
him four years ago. He was a nice well-behaved wolf, that
never gave no trouble to talk of. I'm more surprised at `im
for wantin' to get out nor any other animile in the place.
But, there, you can't trust wolves no more nor women."

"Don't you mind him, Sir!" broke in Mrs. Tom, with a
cheery laugh. " `E's got mindin' the animiles so long that
blest if he ain't like a old wolf `isself! But there ain't
no `arm in `im."

"Well, Sir, it was about two hours after feedin' yes-
terday when I first hear my disturbance. I was makin' up a
litter in the monkey house for a young puma which is ill.
But when I heard the yelpin' and `owlin' I kem away straight.
There was Bersicker a-tearin' like a mad thing at the bars
as if he wanted to get out. There wasn't much people about
that day, and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin
chap, with a `ook nose and a pointed beard, with a few
white hairs runnin' through it. He had a `ard, cold look
and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike to him, for it
seemed as if it was `im as they was hirritated at. He `ad
white kid gloves on `is `ands, and he pointed out the ani-
miles to me and says, `Keeper, these wolves seem upset at
something.'

"`Maybe it's you,' says I, for I did not like the airs
as he give `isself. He didn't get angry, as I `oped he
would, but he smiled a kind of insolent smile, with a mouth
full of white, sharp teeth. `Oh no, they wouldn't like me,'
`e says.

" `Ow yes, they would,' says I, a-imitatin'of him.`They
always like a bone or two to clean their teeth on about tea
time, which you `as a bagful.'

"Well, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us
a-talkin' they lay down, and when I went over to Bersicker he
let me stroke his ears same as ever. That there man kem over,
and blessed but if he didn't put in his hand and stroke the
old wolf's ears too!

" `Tyke care,' says I. `Bersicker is quick.'

" `Never mind,' he says. I'm used to `em!'

" `Are you in the business yourself?" I says, tyking off
my `at, for a man what trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good
friend to keepers.

" `Nom' says he, `not exactly in the business, but I
`ave made pets of several.' and with that he lifts his `at
as perlite as a lord, and walks away. Old Bersicker kep'
a-lookin' arter `im till `e was out of sight, and then went
and lay down in a corner and wouldn't come hout the `ole
hevening. Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup,
the wolves here all began a-`owling. There warn't nothing
for them to `owl at. There warn't no one near, except some
one that was evidently a-callin' a dog somewheres out back
of the gardings in the Park road. Once or twice I went out
to see that all was right, and it was, and then the `owling
stopped. Just before twelve o'clock I just took a look
round afore turnin' in, an', bust me, but when I kem oppo-
site to old Bersicker's cage I see the rails broken and
twisted about and the cage empty. And that's all I know
for certing."

"Did any one else see anything?"

"One of our gard`ners was a-comin' `ome about that time
from a `armony, when he sees a big gray dog comin' out
through the garding `edges.  At least, so he says, but I don't
give much for it myself, for if he did `e never said a word
about it to his missis when `e got `ome, and it was only af-
ter the escape of the wolf was made known, and we had been up
all night a-huntin' of the Park for Bersicker, that he remem-
bered seein' anything. My own belief was that the `armony
`ad got into his `ead."

"Now, Mr. Bilder, can you account in any way for the
escape of the wolf?"

"Well, Sir," he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty,
"I think I can, but I don't know as `ow you'd be satisfied
with the theory."

"Certainly I shall. If a man like you, who knows the
animals from experience, can't hazard a good guess at any
rate, who is even to try?"

"well then, Sir, I accounts for it this way. It seems
to me that `ere wolf escaped--simply because he wanted to
get out."

From the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laugh-
ed at the joke I could see that it had done service before,
and that the whole explanation was simply an elaborate sell.
I couldn't cope in badinage with the worthy Thomas, but I
thought I knew a surer way to his heart, so I said, "Now, Mr.
Bilder, we'll consider that first half-sovereign worked off,
and this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you've
told me what you think will happen."

"Right y`are, Sir," he said briskly. "Ye`ll excoose me,
I know, for a-chaffin' of ye, but the old woman her winked
at me, which was as much as telling me to go on."

"Well, I never!" said the old lady.

"My opinion is this. That `ere wolf is a`idin' of,
somewheres. The gard`ner wot didn't remember said he was
a-gallopin' northward faster than a horse could go, but I
don't believe him, for, yer see, Sir, wolves don't gallop
no more nor dogs does, they not bein' built that way. Wolves
is fine things in a storybook, and I dessay when they gets
in packs and does be chivyin' somethin' that's more afeared
than they is they can make a devil of a noise and chop it
up, whatever it is. But, Lor' bless you, in real life a wolf
is only a low creature, not half so clever or bold as a good
dog, and not half a quarter so much fight in `im. This one
ain't been used to fightin' or even to providin' for hisself,
and more like he's somewhere round the Park a'hidin' an'
a'shiverin' of, and if he thinks at all, wonderin' where he
is to get his breakfast from. Or maybe he's got down some
area and is in a coal cellar. My eye, won't some cook get
a rum start when she sees his green eyes a-shinin' at her
out of the dark! If he can't get food he's bound to look
for it, and mayhap he may chance to light on a butcher's
shop in time. If he doesn't, and some nursemaid goes out
walkin' or orf with a soldier, leavin' of the hinfant in the
perambulator--well, then I shouldn't be surprised if the
census is one babby the less. That's all."

I was handing him the half-sovereign, when something
came bobbing up against the window, and Mr. Bilder's face
doubled its natural length with surprise.

"God bless me!" he said. "If there ain't old Bersicker
come back by `isself!"

He went to the door and opened it, a most unnecessary
proceeding it seemed to me. I have always thought that a
wild animal never looks so well as when some obstacle of
pronounced durability is between us. A personal experience
has intensified rather than diminished that idea.

After all, however, there is nothing like custom, for
neither Bilder nor his wife thought any more of the wolf
than I should of a dog. The animal itself was a peaceful
and well-behaved as that father of all picture-wolves, Red
Riding Hood's quondam friend, whilst moving her confidence
in masquerade.

The whole scene was a unutterable mixture of comedy and
pathos. The wicked wolf that for a half a day had paralyzed
London and set all the children in town shivering in their
shoes, was there in a sort of penitent mood, and was received
and petted like a sort of vulpine prodigal son. Old Bilder
examined him all over with most tender solicitude, and when
he had finished with his penitent said,

"There, I knew the poor old chap would get into some
kind of trouble. Didn't I say it all along? Here's his
head all cut and full of broken glass. `E's been a-gettin'
over some bloomin' wall or other. It's a shyme that people
are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles. This
`ere's what comes of it. Come along, Bersicker."

He took the wolf and locked him up in a cage, with a
piece of meat that satisfied, in quantity at any rate, the
elementary conditions of the fatted calf, and went off to
report.

I came off too, to report the only exclusive information
that is given today regarding the strange escapade at the
Zoo.



DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


17 September.--I was engaged after dinner in my study
posting up my books, which, through press of other work and
the many visits to Lucy, had fallen sadly into arrear. Sud-
denly the door was burst open, and in rushed my patient, with
his face distorted with passion. I was thunderstruck, for
such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord into the
Superintendent's study is almost unknown.

Without an instant's notice he made straight at me. He
had a dinner knife in his hand, and as I saw he was dangerous,
I tried to keep the table between us. He was too quick and
too strong for me, however, for before I could get my balance
he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely.

Before he could strike again, however, I got in my right
hand and he was sprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist
bled freely, and quite a little pool trickled on to the car-
pet. I saw that my friend was not intent on further effort,
and occupied myself binding up my wrist, keeping a wary eye
on the prostrate figure all the time. When the attendants
rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employ-
ment positively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on
the floor licking up, like a dog, the blood which had fallen
from my wounded wrist. He was easily secured, and to my
surprise, went with the attendants quite placidly, simply
repeating over and over again, "The blood is the life! The
blood is the life!"

I cannot afford to lose blood just at present. I have
lost too much of late for my physical good, and then the pro-
longed strain of Lucy's illness and its horrible phases is
telling on me. I am over excited and weary, and I need rest,
rest, rest. Happily Van Helsing has not summoned me, so I
need not forego my sleep. Tonight I could not well do with-
out it.



TELEGRAM, VAN HELSING, ANTWERP, TO SEWARD, CARFAX

(Sent to Carfax, Sussex, as no county given, delivered late
by twenty-two hours.)

17 September.--Do not fail to be at Hilllingham tonight.
If not watching all the time, frequently visit and see that
flowers are as placed, very important, do not fail. Shall be
with you as soon as possible after arrival.



DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


18 September.--Just off train to London. The arrival of
Van Helsing's telegram filled me with dismay. A whole night
lost, and I know by bitter experience what may happen in a
night. Of course it is possible that all may be well, but
what may have happened? Surely there is some horrible doom
hanging over us that every possible accident should thwart
us in all we try to do. I shall take this cylinder with me,
and then I can complete my entry on Lucy's phonograph.




MEMORANDUM LEFT BY LUCY WESTENRA

17 September, Night.--I write this and leave it to be
seen, so that no one may by any chance get into trouble
through me. This is an exact record of what took place to-
night. I feel I am dying of weakness, and have barely
strength to write, but it must be done if I die in the doing.

I went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers
were placed as Dr. Van Helsing directed, and soon fell
asleep.

I was waked by the flapping at the window, which had
begun after that sleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when
Mina saved me, and which now I know so well. I was not
afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was in the next room,
as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be, so that I might have
called him. I tried to sleep, but I could not. Then there
came to me the old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep
awake. Perversely sleep would try to come then when I did
not want it. So, as I feared to be alone, I opened my door
and called out. "Is there anybody there?" There was no
answer. I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door
again. Then outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl
like a dog's, but more fierce and deeper. I went to the win-
dow and looked out, but could see nothing, except a big bat,
which had evidently been buffeting its wings against the
window. So I went back to bed again, but determined not to
go to sleep. Presently the door opened, and mother looked in.
Seeing by my moving that I was not asleep, she came in and
sat by me. She said to me even more sweetly and softly than
her wont,

"I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see
that you were all right."

I feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked
her to come in and sleep with me, so she came into bed, and
lay down beside me. She did not take off her dressing gown,
for she said she would only stay a while and then go back
to her own bed. As she lay there in my arms, and I in hers
the flapping and buffeting came to the window again. She
was startled and a little frightened, and cried out, "What
is that?"

I tried to pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she
lay quiet. But I could hear her poor dear heart still beat-
ing terribly. After a while there was the howl again out in
the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a crash at the
window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor.
The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and
in the aperture of the broken panes there was the head of a
great, gaunt gray wolf.

Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a
sitting posture, and clutched wildly at anything that would
help her. Amongst other things, she clutched the wreath of
flowers that Dr. Van Helsing insisted on my wearing round
my neck, and tore it away from me. For a second or two she
sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange and
horrible gurgling in her throat. Then she fell over, as if
struck with lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made
me dizzy for a moment or two.

The room and all round seemed to spin round. I kept my
eyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back,
and a whole myriad of little specks seems to come blowing
in through the broken window, and wheeling and circling
round like the pillar of dust that travellers describe when
there is a simoon in the desert. I tried to stir, but there
was some spell upon me, and dear Mother's poor body, which
seemed to grow cold already, for her dear heart had ceased
to beat, weighed me down, and I remembered no more for a
while.

The time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till
I recovered consciousness again. Somewhere near, a passing
bell was tolling. The dogs all round the neighborhood were
howling, and in our shrubbery, seemingly just outside, a
nightingale was singing. I was dazed and stupid with pain
and terror and weakness, but the sound of the nightingale
seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort
me. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for
I could hear their bare feet pattering outside my door. I
called to them, and they came in, and when they saw what had
happened, and what it was that lay over me on the bed, they
screamed out. The wind rushed in through the broken window,
and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of my
dear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the
bed after I had got up. They were all so frightened and
nervous that I directed them to go to the dining room and
each have a glass of wine. The door flew open for an instant
and closed again. The maids shrieked, and then went in a
body to the dining room, and I laid what flowers I had on
my dear mother's breast. When they were there I remembered
what Dr. Van Helsing had told me, but I didn't like to re-
move them, and besides, I would have some of the servants
to sit up with me now. I was surprised that the maids did
not come back. I called them, but got no answer, so I went
to the dining room to look for them.

My heart sank when I saw what had happened. They all
four lay helpless on the floor, breathing heavily. The de-
canter of sherry was on the table half full, but there was
a queer, acrid smell about. I was suspicious, and examined
the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, and looking on the
sideboard, I found that the bottle which Mother's doctor uses
for her--oh! did use--was empty. What am I to do? What am I
to do? I am back in the room with Mother. I cannot leave her,
and I am alone, save for the sleeping servants, whom some
one has drugged. Alone with the dead! I dare not go out, for
I can hear the low howl of the wolf through the broken
window.

The air seems full of specks, floating and circling in
the draught from the window, and the lights burn blue and
dim. What am I to do? God shield me from harm this night!
I shall hide this paper in my breast, where they shall find
it when they come to lay me out. My dear mother gone! It
is time that I go too. Goodbye, dear Arthur, if I should
not survive this night. God keep you, dear, and God help me!





CHAPTER 12


DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


18 September.--I drove at once to Hillingham and ar-
rived early. Keeping my cab at the gate, I went up the
avenue alone. I knocked gently and rang as quietly as pos-
sible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or her mother, and hoped
to only bring a servant to the door. After a while, finding
no response, I knocked and rang again, still no answer. I
cursed the laziness of the servants that they should lie
abed at such an hour, for it was now ten o'clock, and so rang
and knocked again, but more impatiently, but still without
response. Hitherto I had blamed only the servants, but now
a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this desolation but
another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing tight
round us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come,
too late? I know that minutes, even seconds of delay, might
mean hours of danger to Lucy, if she had had again one of
those frightful relapses, and I went round the house to try
if I could find by chance an entry anywhere.

I could find no means of ingress. Every window and door
was fastened and locked, and I returned baffled to the porch.
As I did so, I heard the rapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven
horse's feet. They stopped at the gate, and a few seconds
later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue. When he saw
me, he gasped out, "Then it was you, and just arrived. How
is she? Are we too late? Did you not get my telegram?"

I answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I
had only got his telegram early in the morning, and had not
a minute in coming here, and that I could not make any one
in the house hear me. He paused and raised his hat as he
said solemnly, "Then I fear we are too late. God's will be
done!"

With his usual recuperative energy, he went on, "Come.
If there be no way open to get in, we must make one. Time
is all in all to us now."

We went round to the back of the house, where there was
a kitchen window. The Professor took a small surgical saw
from his case, and handing it to me, pointed to the iron bars
which guarded the window. I attacked them at once and had
very soon cut through three of them. Then with a long, thin
knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and opened
the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him.
There was no one in the kitchen or in the servants' rooms,
which were close at hand. We tried all the rooms as we went
along, and in the dining room, dimly lit by rays of light
through the shutters, found four servant women lying on the
floor. There was no need to think them dead, for their ster-
torous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the room
left no doubt as to their condition.

Van Helsing and I looked at each other, and as we moved
away he said, "We can attend to them later."Then we ascended
to Lucy's room. For an instant or two we paused at the door
to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear. With
white faces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently,
and entered the room.

How shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two
women, Lucy and her mother. The latter lay farthest in, and
she was covered with a white sheet, the edge of which had
been blown back by the drought through the broken window,
showing the drawn, white, face, with a look of terror fixed
upon it. By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still
more drawn. The flowers which had been round her neck we
found upon her mother's bosom, and her throat was bare, show-
ing the two little wounds which we had noticed before, but
looking horribly white and mangled. Without a word the Pro-
fessor bent over the bed, his head almost touching poor
Lucy's breast. Then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of
one who listens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me,
"It is not yet too late! Quick! Quick! Bring the brandy!"

I flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to
smell and taste it, lest it, too, were drugged like the de-
canter of sherry which I found on the table. The maids were
still breathing, but more restlessly, and I fancied that the
narcotic was wearing off. I did not stay to make sure, but
returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy, as on another
occasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the
palms of her hands. He said to me, "I can do this, all that
can be at the present. You go wake those maids. Flick them
in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make them
get heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly
as cold as that beside her. She will need be heated before
we can do anything more."

I went at once, and found little difficulty in waking
three of the women. The fourth was only a young girl, and
the drug had evidently affected her more strongly so I lift-
ed her on the sofa and let her sleep.

The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came
back to them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I
was stern with them, however, and would not let them talk. I
told them that one life was bad enough to lose, and if they
delayed they would sacrifice Miss Lucy. So, sobbing and cry-
ing they went about their way, half clad as they were, and
prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and boiler
fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water.
We got a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed
her in it. Whilst we were busy chafing her limbs there was a
knock at the hall door. One of the maids ran off, hurried
on some more clothes, and opened it. Then she returned and
whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come with
a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him
that he must wait, for we could see no one now. She went
away with the message, and, engrossed with our work, I clean
forgot all about him.

I never saw in all my experience the Professor work in
such deadly earnest. I knew, as he knew, that it was a
stand-up fight with death, and in a pause told him so. He
answered me in a way that I did not understand, but with the
sternest look that his face could wear.

"If that were all, I would stop here where we are now,
and let her fade away into peace, for I see no light in life
over her horizon." He went on with his work with, if poss-
ible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.

Presently we both began to be conscious that the heat
was beginning to be of some effect. Lucy's heart beat a
trifle more audibly to the stethoscope, and her lungs had a
perceptible movement. Van Helsing's face almost beamed, and
as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in a hot sheet
to dry her he said to me, "The first gain is ours! Check to
the King!"

We took Lucy into another room, which had by now been
prepared, and laid her in bed and forced a few drops of
brandy down her throat. I noticed that Van Helsing tied a
soft silk handkerchief round her throat. She was still
unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we
had ever seen her.

Van Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to
stay with her and not to take her eyes off her till we re-
turned, and then beckoned me out of the room.

"We must consult as to what is to be done," he said as
we descended the stairs. In the hall he opened the dining
room door, and we passed in, he closing the door carefully
behind him. The shutters had been opened, but the blinds
were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of
death which the British woman of the lower classes always
rigidly observes. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It
was, however, light enough for our purposes. Van Helsing's
sternness was somewhat relieved by a look of perplexity. He
was evidently torturing his mind about something, so I waited
for an instant, and he spoke.

"What are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help?
We must have another transfusion of blood, and that soon, or
that poor girl's life won't be worth an hour's purchase. You
are exhausted already. I am exhausted too. I fear to trust
those women, even if they would have courage to submit. What
are we to do for some one who will open his veins for her?"

"What's the matter with me, anyhow?"

The voice came from the sofa across the room, and its
tones brought relief and joy to my heart, for they were those
of Quincey Morris.

Van Helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his
face softened and a glad look came into his eyes as I cried
out, "Quincey Morris!" and rushed towards him with out-
stretched hands.

"What brought you her?" I cried as our hands met.

"I guess Art is the cause."

He handed me a telegram.-- `Have not heard from Seward
for three days, and am terribly anxious. Cannot leave. Father
still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is. Do not
delay.--Holmwood.'

"I think I came just in the nick of time. You know you
have only to tell me what to do."

Van Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking
him straight in the eyes as he said, "A brave man's blood is
the best thing on this earth when a woman is in trouble.
You're a man and no mistake. Well, the devil may work
against us for all he's worth, but God sends us men when we
want them."

Once again we went through that ghastly operation. I
have not the heart to go through with the details. Lucy had
got a terrible shock and it told on her more than before, for
though plenty of blood went into her veins, her body did not
respond to the treatment as well as on the other occasions.
Her struggle back into life was something frightful to see
and hear. However, the action of both heart and lungs im-
proved, and Van Helsing made a sub-cutaneous injection of
morphia, as before, and with good effect. Her faint became
a profound slumber. The Professor watched whilst I went
downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maids
to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting.

I left Quincey lying down after having a glass of wine,
and told the cook to get ready a good breakfast. Then a
thought struck me, and I went back to the room where Lucy
now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a
sheet or two of note paper in his hand. He had evidently
read it, and was thinking it over as he sat with his hand to
his brow. There was a look of grim satisfaction in his face,
as of one who has had a doubt solved. He handed me the paper
saying only, "It dropped from Lucy's breast when we carried
her to the bath."

When I had read it, I stook looking at the Professor,
and after a pause asked him, "In God's name, what does it
all mean? Was she, or is she, mad, or what sort of horri-
ble danger is it?" I was so bewildered that I did not know
what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took
the paper, saying,

"Do not trouble about it now. Forget if for the pre-
sent. You shall know and understand it all in good time, but
it will be later. And now what is it that you came to me to
say?" This brought me back to fact, and I was all myself
again.

"I came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do
not act properly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and
that paper would have to be produced. I am in hopes that we
need have no inquest, for if we had it would surely kill poor
Lucy, if nothing else did. I know, and you know, and the
other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs. Westenra had
disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it.
Let us fill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it
myself to the registrar and go on to the undertaker."

"Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss
Lucy, if she be sad in the foes that beset her, is at least
happy in the friends thatlove her. One, two, three, all open
their veins for her, besides one old man. Ah, yes, I know,
friend John. I am not blind! I love you all the more for it!
Now go."

In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for
Arthur telling him that Mrs. Westenra was dead, that Lucy
also had been ill, but was now going on better, and that Van
Helsing and I were with her. I told him where I was going,
and he hurried me out, but as I was going said,

"When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you
all to ourselves?" I nodded in reply and went out. I found no
difficulty about the registration, and arranged with the local
undertaker to come up in the evening to measure for the
coffin and to make arrangements.

When I got back Quincey was waiting for me. I told him
I would see him as soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to
her room. She was still sleeping, and the Professor seemingly
had not moved from his seat at her side. From his putting his
finger to his lips, I gathered that he expected her to wake
before long and was afraid of fore-stalling nature. So I went
down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast room, where
the blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more
cheerful, or rather less cheerless, than the other rooms.

When we were alone, he said to me, "Jack Seward, I don't
want to shove myself in anywhere where I've no right to be,
but this is no ordinary case. You know I loved that girl and
wanted to marry her, but although that's all past and gone, I
can't help feeling anxious about her all the same. What is
it that's wrong with her? The Dutchman, and a fine old fellow
is is, I can see that, said that time you two came into the
room, that you must have another transfusion of blood, and
that both you and he were exhausted. Now I know well that you
medical men speak in camera, and that a man must not expect
to know what they consult about in private. But this is no
common matter, and whatever it is, I have done my part. Is not
that so?"

"That's so," I said, and he went on.

"I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done al-
ready what I did today. Is not that so?"

"That's so."

"And I guess Art was in it too. When I saw him four
days ago down at his own place he looked queer. I have not
seen anything pulled down so quick since I was on the Pampas
and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass all in a night.
One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at her
in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open,
there wasn't enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I
had to put a bullet through her as she lay. Jack, if you
may tell me without betraying confidence, Arthur was the
first, is not that so?"

As he spoke the poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He
was in a torture of suspense regarding the woman he loved,
and his utter ignorance of the terrible mystery which seem-
ed to surround her intensified his pain. His very heart
was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him, and there
was a royal lot of it, too, to keep him from breaking down.
I paused before answering, for I felt that I must not betray
anything which the Professor wished kept secret, but already
he knew so much, and guessed so much, that there could be no
reason for not answering, so I answered in the same phrase.

"That's so."

"And how long has this been going on?"

"About ten days."

"Ten days! Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor
pretty creature that we all love has had put into her veins
within that time the blood of four strong men. Man alive,
her whole body wouldn't hold it." Then coming close to me,
he spoke in a fierce half-whisper. "What took it out?"

I shook my head. "That," I said, "is the crux. Van
Helsing is simply frantic about it, and I am at my wits' end.
I can't even hazard a guess. There has been a series of
little circumstances which have thrown out all our calcula-
tions as to Lucy being properly watched. But these shall
not occur again. Here we stay until all be well, or ill."

Quincey held out his hand. "Count me in," he said. "You
and the Dutchman will tell me what to do, and I'll do it."

When she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy's first move-
ment was to feel in her breast, and to my surprise, produced
the paper which Van Helsing had given me to read. The care-
ful Professor had replaced it where it had come from, lest
on waking she should be alarmed. Her eyes then lit on Van
Helsing and on me too, and gladdened. Then she looked round
the room, and seeing where she was, shuddered. She gave a
loud cry, and put her poor thin hands before her pale face.

We both understood what was meant, that she had real-
ized to the full her mother's death. So we tried what we
could to comfort her. Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat,
but she was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently
and weakly for a long time. We told her that either or both
of us would now remain with her all the time, and that seemed
to comfort her. Towards dusk she fell into a doze. Here a
very odd thing occurred. Whilst still asleep she took the
paper from her breast and tore it in two. Van Helsing stepped
over and took the pieces from her. All the same, however,
she went on with the action of tearing, as though the mater-
ial were still in her hands. Finally she lifted her hands
and opened them as though scattering the fragments. Van
Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as if in
thought, but he said nothing.


19 September.--All last night she slept fitfully, being
always afraid to sleep, and something weaker when she woke
from it. The Professor and I took in turns to watch, and we
never left her for a moment unattended. Quincey Morris said
nothing about his intention, but I knew that all night long
he patrolled round and round the house.

When the day came, its searching light showed the rav-
ages in poor Lucy's strength. She was hardly able to turn
her head, and the little nourishment which she could take
seemed to do her no good. At times she slept, and both Van
Helsing and I noticed the difference in her, between sleep-
ing and waking. Whilst asleep she looked stronger, although
more haggard, and her breathing was softer. Her open mouth
showed the pale gums drawn back from the teeth, which looked
positively longer and sharper than usual. When she woke the
softness of her eyes evidently changed the expression, for
she looked her own self, although a dying one. In the after-
noon she asked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him. Quinc-
ey went off to meet him at the station.

When he arrived it was nearly six o'clock, and the sun
was setting full and warm, and the red light streamed in
through the window and gave more color to the pale cheeks.
When he saw her, Arthur was simply choking with emotion, and
none of us could speak. In the hours that had passed, the fits
of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, had
grown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was
possible were shortened. Arthur's presence, however, seemed
to act as a stimulant. She rallied a little, and spoke to him
more brightly than she had done since we arrived. He too
pulled himself together, and spoke as cheerily as he could,
so that the best was made of everything.

It is now nearly one o'clock, and he and Van Helsing
are sitting with her. I am to relieve them in a quarter
of an hour, and I am entering this on Lucy's phonograph. Until
six o'clock they are to try to rest. I fear that tomorrow
will end our watching, for the shock has been too great. The
poor child cannot rally. God help us all.




LETTER MINA HARKER TO LUCY WESTENRA

(Unopened by her)


17 September

My dearest Lucy,

"It seems an age since I heard from you, or indeed since
I wrote. You will pardon me, I know, for all my faults when
you have read all my budget of news. Well, I got my hus-
band back all right. When we arrived at Exeter there was a
carriage waiting for us, and in it, though he had an attack
of gout, Mr. Hawkins. He took us to his house, where there
were rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we dined
together. After dinner Mr. Hawkins said,

" `My dears, I want to drink your health and prosper-
ity, and may every blessing attend you both. I know you
both from children, and have, with love and pride, seen you
grow up. Now I want you to make your home here with me. I
have left to me neither chick nor child.  All are gone, and in
my will I have left you everything.' I cried, Lucy dear, as
Jonathan and the old man clasped hands. Our evening was a
very, very happy one.

"So here we are, installed in this beautiful old house,
and from both my bedroom and the drawing room I can see the
great elms of the cathedral close, with their great black
stems standing out against the old yellow stone of the cath-
edral, and I can hear the rooks overhead cawing and cawing
and chattering and chattering and gossiping all day, after
the manner of rooks--and humans. I am busy, I need not tell
you, arranging things and housekeeping. Jonathan and Mr.
Hawkins are busy all day, for now that Jonathan is a partner,
Mr. Hawkins wants to tell him all about the clients.

"How is your dear mother getting on? I wish I could
run up to town for a day or two to see you, dear, but I, dare
not go yet, with so much on my shoulders, and Jonathan wants
looking after still. He is beginning to put some flesh on his
bones again, but he was terribly weakened by the long illness.
Even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a sudden
way and awakes all trembling until I can coax him back to
his usual placidity. However, thank God, these occasions grow
less frequent as the days go on, and they will in time pass
away altogether, I trust. And now I have told you my news,
let me ask yours. When are you to be married, and where, and
who is to perform the ceremony, and what are you to wear, and
is it to be a public or private wedding? Tell me all about
it, dear, tell me all about everything, for there is nothing
which interests you which will not be dear to me. Jonathan
asks me to send his `respectful duty', but I do not think
that is good enough from the junior partner of the important
firm Hawkins & Harker. And so, as you love me, and he loves
me, and I love you with all the moods and tenses of the verb,
I send you simply his `love' instead. Goodbye, my dearest
Lucy, and blessings on you."
Yours,
Mina Harker



REPORT FROM PATRICK HENNESSEY, MD, MRCSLK, QCPI, ETC, ETC,
TO JOHN SEWARD, MD

20 September

My dear Sir:

"In accordance with your wishes, I enclose report of
the conditions of everything left in my charge. With regard
to patient, Renfield, there is more to say. He has had an-
other outbreak, which might have had a dreadful ending, but
which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended with any
unhappy results. This afternoon a carrier's cart with two men
made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours,
the house to which, you will remember, the patient twice ran
away. The men stopped at our gate to ask the porter their
way, as they were strangers.

"I was myself looking out of the study window, having a
smoke after dinner, and saw one of them come up to the house.
As he passed the window of Renfield's room, the patient be-
gan to rate him from within, and called him all the foul
names he could lay his tongue to. The man, who seemed a de-
cent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to `shut
up for a foul-mouthed beggar', whereon our man accused him of
robbing him and wanting to murder him and said that he would
hinder him if he were to swing for it. I opened the window
and signed to the man not to notice, so he contented himself
after looking the place over and making up his mind as to
what kind of place he had got to by saying, `Lor' bless yer,
sir, I wouldn't mind what was said to me in a bloomin' mad-
house. I pity ye and the guv'nor for havin' to live in the
house with a wild beast like that.'

"Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I told him
where the gate of the empty house was. He went away follow-
ed by threats and curses and revilings from our man. I went
down to see if I could make out any cause for his anger,
since he is usually such a well-behaved man, and except his
violent fits nothing of the kind had ever occurred. I found
him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most genial in
his manner. I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but
he blandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led me
to believe that he was completely oblivious of the affair.
It was, I am sorry to say, however, only another instance of
his cunning, for within half an hour I heard of him again.
This time he had broken out through the window of his room,
and was running down the avenue. I called to the attendants
to follow me, and ran after him, for I feared he was intent
on some mischief. My fear was justified when I saw the same
cart which had passed before coming down the road, having on
it some great wooden boxes. The men were wiping their fore-
heads, and were flushed in the face, as if with violent ex-
ercise. Before I could get up to him, the patient rushed at
them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began to knock
his head against the ground. If I had not seized him just
at the moment, I believe he would have killed the man there
and then. The other fellow jumped down and struck him over
the head with the butt end of his heavy whip. It was a
horrible blow, but he did not seem to mind it, but seized
him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to
and fro as if we were kittens. You know I am no lightweight,
and the others were both burly men. At first he was silent
in his fighting, but as we began to master him, and the at-
tendants were putting a strait waistcoat on him, he began to
shout, `I'll frustrate them! They shan't rob me! They shan't
murder me by inches! I'll fight for my Lord and Master!'and
all sorts of similar incoherent ravings. It was with very
considerable difficulty that they got him back to the house
and put him in the padded room. One of the attendants,
Hardy, had a finger broken. However, I set it all right, and
he is going on well.

"The two carriers were at first loud in their threats
of actions for damages, and promised to rain all the pen-
alties of the law on us. Their threats were, however,
mingled with some sort of indirect apology for the defeat
of the two of them by a feeble madman. They said that if
it had not been for the way their strength had been spent
in carrying and raising the heavy boxes to the cart they
would have made short work of him. They gave as another
reason for their defeat the extraordinary state of drouth
to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of
their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the
scene of their labors of any place of public entertainment.
I quite understood their drift, and after a stiff glass of
strong grog, or rather more of the same, and with each a
sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore
that they would encounter a worse madman any day for the
pleasure of meeting so `bloomin' good a bloke' as your
correspondent. I took their names and addresses, in case
they might be needed. They are as follows: Jack Smollet,
of Dudding's Rents, King George's Road, Great Walworth, and
Thomas Snelling, Peter Farley's Row, Guide Court, Bethnal
Green. They are both in the employment of Harris & Sons,
Moving and Shipment Company, Orange Master's Yard, Soho.

"I shall report to you any matter of interest occurr-
ing here, and shall wire you at once if there is anything of
importance.

"Believe me, dear Sir,

"Yours faithfully,

"Patrick Hennessey."



LETTER, MINA HARKER TO LUCY WESTENRA
(Unopened by her)


18 September

"My dearest Lucy,

"Such a sad blow has befallen us. Mr. Hawkins has died
very suddenly. Some may not think it so sad for us, but we
had both come to so love him that it really seems as though
we had lost a father. I never knew either father or mother,
so that the dear old man's death is a real blow to me. Jon-
athan is greatly distressed. It is not only that he feels
sorrow, deep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended
him all his life, and now at the end has treated him like his
own son and left him a fortune which to people of our modest
bringing up is wealth beyond the dream of avarice, but Jona-
than feels it on another account. He says the amount of re-
sponsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous. He
begins to doubt himself. I try to cheer him up, and my belief
in him helps him to have a belief in himself. But it is here
that the grave shock that he experienced tells upon him the
most. Oh, it is too hard that a sweet, simple, noble, strong
nature such as his, a nature which enabled him by our dear,
good friend's aid to rise from clerk to master in a few
years, should be so injured that the very essence of its
strength is gone. Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my
troubles in the midst of your own happiness, but Lucy dear,
I must tell someone, for the strain of keeping up a brave and
cheerful appearance to Jonathan tries me, and I have no one
here that I can confide in. I dread coming up to London, as
we must do that day after tomorrow, for poor Mr. Hawkins left
in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his
father. As there are no relations at all, Jonathan will have
to be chief mourner. I shall try to run over to see you,
dearest, if only for a few minutes. Forgive me for troubling
you. With all blessings,

"Your loving

Mina Harker"



DR. SEWARD' DIARY


20 September.--Only resolution and habit can let me
make an entry tonight. I am too miserable, too low spirited,
too sick of the world and all in it, including life itself,
that I would not care if I heard this moment the flapping of
the wings of the angel of death. And he has been flapping
those grim wings to some purpose of late, Lucy's mother and
Arthur's father, and now. . . Let me get on with my work.

I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy. We
wanted Arthur to go to rest also, but he refused at first.
It was only when I told him that we should want him to help
us during the day, and that we must not all break down for
want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed to go.

Van Helsing was very kind to him. "Come, my child," he
said. "Come with me. You are sick and weak, and have had
much sorrow and much mental pain, as well as that tax on your
strength that we know of. You must not be alone, for to be
alone is to be full of fears and alarms. Come to the drawing
room, where there is a big fire, and there are two sofas. You
shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy will
be comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and
even if we sleep."

Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look
on Lucy's face, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than
the lawn. She lay quite still, and I looked around the room
to see that all was as it should be. I could see that the
Professor had carried out in this room, as in the other, his
purpose of using the garlic. The whole of the window sashes
reeked with it, and round Lucy's neck, over the silk hand-
kerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough
chaplet of the same odorous flowers.

Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and her face
was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums.
Her teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and
sharper than they had been in the morning. In particular,
by some trick of the light, the canine teeth looked longer
and sharper than the rest.

I sat down beside her, and presently she moved uneas-
ily. At the same moment there came a sort of dull flapping
or buffeting at the window. I went over to it softly, and
peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full
moonlight, and I could see that the noise was made by a great
bat, which wheeled around, doubtless attracted by the light,
although so dim, and every now and again struck the window
with its wings. When I came back to my seat, I found that
Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic flowers
from her throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat
watching her.

Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing
had prescribed. She took but a little, and that languidly.
There did not seem to be with her now the unconscious strug-
gle for life and strength that had hitherto so marked her
illness. It struck me as curious that the moment she became
conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. It
was certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic
state, with the stertorous breathing, she put the flowers
from her, but that when she waked she clutched them close,
There was no possibility of making amy mistake about this,
for in the long hours that followed, she had many spells
of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.

At six o'clock Van Helsing came to relieve me. Arthur
had then fallen into a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep
on. When he saw Lucy's face I could hear the sissing indraw
of breath, and he said to me in a sharp whisper."Draw up the
blind. I want light!" Then he bent down, and, with his face
almost touching Lucy's, examined her carefully. He removed
the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat.
As he did so he started back and I could hear his ejacula-
tion, "Mein Gott!" as it was smothered in his throat. I
bent over and looked, too, and as I noticed some queer chill
came over me. The wounds on the throat had absolutely dis-
appeared.

For fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her,
with his face at its sternest. Then he turned to me and said
calmly, "She is dying. It will not be long now. It will be
much difference, mark me, whether she dies conscious or in
her sleep. Wake that poor boy, and let him come and see the
last. He trusts us, and we have promised him."

I went to the dining room and waked him. He was dazed
for a moment, but when he saw the sunlight streaming in
through the edges of the shutters he thought he was late, and
expressed his fear. I assured him that Lucy was still asleep,
but told him as gently as i could that both Van Helsing and
I feared that the end was near. He covered his face with his
hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he re-
mained, perhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying,
whilst his shoulders shook with grief. I took him by the
hand and raised him up. "Come," I said, "my dear old fellow,
summon all your fortitude. It will be best and easiest for
her."

When we came into Lucy's room I could see that Van Hel-
sing had, with his usual forethought, been putting matters
straight and making everything look as pleasing as possible.
He had even brushed Lucy's hair, so that it lay on the
pillow in its usual sunny ripples. When we came into the
room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered softly,
"Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!"

He was stooping to kiss her, when Van Helsing motioned
him back. "No," he whispered, "not yet! Hold her hand, it
will comfort her more."

So Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she
looked her best, with all the soft lines matching the angelic
beauty of her eyes. Then gradually her eyes closed, and she
sank to sleep. For a little bit her breast heaved softly,
and her breath came and went like a tired child's.

And then insensibly there came the strange change which
I had noticed in the night. Her breathing grew stertorous,
the mouth opened, and the pale gums, drawn back, made the
teeth look longer and sharper than ever. In a sort of sleep-
waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which
were now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous
voice, such as I had never heard from her lips, "Arthur! Oh,
my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!"

Arthur bent eagerly over to kiss her, but at that in-
stant Van Helsing, who, like me, had been startled by her
voice, swooped upon him, and catching him by the neck with
both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength which
I never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurl-
ed him almost across the room.

"Not on your life!" he said, "not for your living soul
and hers!" And he stood between them like a lion at bay.

Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment
know what to do or say, and before any impulse of violence
could seize him he realized the place and the occasion, and
stood silent, waiting.

I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and
we saw a spasm as of rage flit like a shadow over her face.
The sharp teeth clamped together. Then her eyes closed, and
she breathed heavily.

Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their
softness, and putting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took
Van Helsing's great brown one, drawing it close to her, she
kissed it. "My true friend," she said, in a faint voice, but
with untellable pathos, "My true friend, and his! Oh, guard
him, and give me peace!"

"I swear it!" he said solemnly, kneeling beside her
and holding up his hand, as one who registers an oath. Then
he turned to Arthur, and said to him, "Come, my child, take
her hand in yours, and kiss her on the forehead, and only
once."

Their eyes met instead of their lips, and so they part-
ed. Lucy's eyes closed, and Van Helsing, who had been watch-
ing closely, took Arthur's arm, and drew him away.

And then Lucy's breathing became stertorous again, and
all at once it ceased.

"It is all over," said Van Helsing. "She is dead!"

I took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the draw-
ing room, where he sat down, and covered his face with his
hands, sobbing in a way that nearly broke me down to see.

I went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking
at poor Lucy, and his face was sterner than eve. Some change
had come over her body. Death had given back part of her
beauty, for her brow and cheeks had recovered some of their
flowing lines. Even the lips had lost their deadly pallor.
It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the working of
the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little
rude as might be.

"We thought her dying whilst she slept,
And sleeping when she died."


I stood beside Van Helsing, and said, "Ah well, poor
girl, there is peace for her at last. It is the end!"

He turned to me, and said with grave solemnity, "Not so,
alas! Not so. It is only the beginning!"

When I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head
and answered, "We can do nothing as yet. Wait and see."





CHAPTER 13


DR. SEWARD'S DIARY--cont.


The funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day,
so that Lucy and her mother might be buried together. I
attended to all the ghastly formalities, and the urbane
undertaker proved that his staff was afflicted, or blessed,
with something of his own obsequious suavity. Even the
woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked
to me, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when
she had come out from the death chamber,

"She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir. It's quite
a privilege to attend on her. It's not too much to say that
she will do credit to our establishment!"

I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. This
was possible from the disordered state of things in the
household. There were no relatives at hand, and as Arthur
had to be back the next day to attend at his father's fun-
eral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been
bidden. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it
upon ourselves to examine papers, etc. He insisted upon
looking over Lucy's papers himself. I asked him why, for I
feared that he, being a foreigner, might not be quite aware
of English legal requirements, and so might in ignorance make
some unnecessary trouble.

He answered me, "I know, I know. You forget that I am a
lawyer as well as a doctor. But this is not altogether for
the law. You knew that, when you avoided the coroner. I
have more than him to avoid. There may be papers more, such
as this."

As he spoke he took from his pocket book the memorandum
which had been in Lucy's breast, and which she had torn in
her sleep.

"When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the
late Mrs. Westenra, seal all her papers, and write him tonight.
For me, I watch here in the room and in Miss Lucy's old room
all night, and I myself search for what may be. It is not
well that her very thoughts go into the hands of strangers."

I went on with my part of the work, and in another half
hour had found the name and address of Mrs. Westenra's sol-
icitor and had written to him. All the poor lady's papers
were in order. Explicit directions regarding the place of
burial were given. I had hardly sealed the letter, when, to
my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room, saying,

"Can I help you friend John? I am free, and if I may,
my service is to you."

"Have you got what you looked for?" I asked.

To which he replied, "I did not look for any specific
thing. I only hoped to find, and find I have, all that there
was, only some letters and a few memoranda, and a diary new
begun. But I have them here, and we shall for the present
say nothing of them. I shall see that poor lad tomorrow
evening, and, with his sanction, I shall use some."

When we had finished the work in hand, he said to me,
"And now, friend John, I think we may to bed. We want sleep,
both you and I, and rest to recuperate. Tomorrow we shall
have much to do, but for the tonight there is no need of us.
Alas!"

Before turning in we went to look at poor Lucy. The
undertaker had certainly done his work well, for the room
was turned into a small chapelle ardente. There was a wild-
erness of beautiful white flowers, and death was made as
little repulsive as might be. The end of the winding sheet
was laid over the face. When the Professor bent over and
turned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before
us. The tall wax candles showing a sufficient light to note
it well. All Lucy's loveliness had come back to her in death,
and the hours that had passed, instead of leaving traces of
`decay's effacing fingers', had but restored the beauty of
life, till positively I could not believe my eyes that I was
looking at a corpse.

The Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved
her as I had, and there was no need for tears in his eyes.
He said to me, "Remain till I return," and left the room. He
came back with a handful of wild garlic from the box waiting
in the hall, but which had not been opened, and placed the
flowers amongst the others on and around the bed. Then he
took from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold cruci-
fix, and placed it over the mouth. He restored the sheet to
its place, and we came away.

I was undressing in my own room, when, with a premoni-
tory tap at the door, he entered, and at once began to speak.

"Tomorrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set
of post-mortem knives."

"Must we make an autopsy?" I asked.

"Yes and no. I want to operate, but not what you think.
Let me tell you now, but not a word to another. I want to
cut off her head and take out her heart. Ah! You a surgeon,
and so shocked! You, whom I have seen with no tremble of
hand or heart, do operations of life and death that make the
rest shudder. Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend
John, that you loved her, and I have not forgotten it for is
I that shall operate, and you must not help. I would like to
do it tonight, but for Arthur I must not. He will be free
after his father's funeral tomorrow, and he will want to see
her, to see it. Then, when she is coffined ready for the
next day, you and I shall come when all sleep. We shall
unscrew the coffin lid, and shall do our operation, and then
replace all, so that none know, save we alone."

"But why do it at all? The girl is dead. Why mutilate
her poor body without need? And if there is no necessity for
a post-mortem and nothing to gain by it, no good to her, to
us, to science, to human knowledge, why do it? Without such
it is monstrous."

For answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said,
with infinite tenderness, "Friend John, I pity your poor
bleeding heart, and I love you the more because it does so
bleed. If I could, I would take on myself the burden that
you do bear. But there are things that you know not, but
that you shall know, and bless me for knowing, though they
are not pleasant things. John, my child, you have been my
friend now many years, and yet did you ever know me to do
any without good cause? I may err, I am but man, but I be-
lieve in all I do. Was it not for these causes that you
send for me when the great trouble came? Yes! Were you not
amazed, nay horrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his
love, though she was dying, and snatched him away by all my
strength? Yes! And yet you saw how she thanked me, with her
so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so weak, and she
kiss my rough old hand and bless me? Yes! And did you not
hear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes
grateful? Yes!

"Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do. You
have for many years trust me. You have believe me weeks past,
when there be things so strange that you might have well
doubt. Believe me yet a little, friend John. If you trust me
not, then I must tell what I think, and that is not perhaps
well. And if I work, as work I shall, no matter trust or no
trust, without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart
and feel, oh so lonely when I want all help and courage that
may be!" He paused a moment and went on solemnly, "Friend
John, there are strange and terrible days before us. Let us
not be two, but one, that so we work to a good end. Will you
not have faith in me?"

I took his hand, and promised him. I held my door open
as he went away, and watched him go to his room and close the
door. As I stood without moving, I saw one of the maids pass
silently along the passage, she had her back to me, so did
not see me, and go into the room where Lucy lay. The sight
touched me. Devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful to
those who show it unasked to those we love. Here was a poor
girl putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of
death to go watch alone by the bier of the mistress whom she
loved, so that the poor clay might not be lonely till laid
to eternal rest.

I must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad
daylight when Van Helsing waked me by coming into my room.
He came over to my bedside and said, "You need not trouble
about the knives. We shall not do it."

"Why not?" I asked. For his solemnity of the night
before had greatly impressed me.

"Because," he said sternly, "it is too late, or too
early. See!" Here he held up the little golden crucifix.

"This was stolen in the night."

"How stolen, "I asked in wonder, "since you have it now?"

"Because I get it back from the worthless wretch who
stole it, from the woman who robbed the dead and the living.
Her punishment will surely come, but not through me. She
knew not altogether what she did, and thus unknowing, she
only stole. Now we must wait." He went away on the word,
leaving me with a new mystery to think of, a new puzzle to
grapple with.

The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solici-
tor came, Mr. Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidder-
dale. He was very genial and very appreciative of what we
had done, and took off our hands all cares as to details.
During lunch he told us that Mrs. Westenra had for some time
expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairs
in absolute order. He informed us that, with the exception
of a certain entailed property of Lucy's father which now,
in default of direct issue, went back to a distant branch of
the family, the whole estate, real and personal, was left
absolutely to Arthur Holmwood. When he had told us so much
he went on,

"Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary
disposition, and pointed out certain contingencies that might
leave her daughter either penniless or not so free as she
should be to act regarding a matrimonial alliance. Indeed,
we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into colli-
sion, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to
carry out her wishes. Of course, we had then no alternative
but to accept. We were right in principle, and ninety-nine
times out of a hundred we should have proved, by the logic of
events, the accuracy of our judgment.

"Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any
other form of disposition would have rendered impossible the
carrying out of her wishes. For by her predeceasing her
daughter the latter would have come into possession of the
property, and, even had she only survived her mother by five
minutes, her property would, in case there were no will, and
a will was a practical impossibility in such a case, have
been treated at her decease as under intestacy. In which
case Lord Godalming, though so dear a friend, would have had
no claim in the world. And the inheritors, being remote,
would not be likely to abandon their just rights, for senti-
mental reasons regarding an entire stranger. I assure you,
my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced."

He was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one
little part, in which he was officially interested, of so
great a tragedy, was an object-lesson in the limitations of
sympathetic understanding.

He did not remain long, but said he would look in later
in the day and see Lord Godalming. His coming, however, had
been a certain comfort to us, since it assured us that we
should not have to dread hostile criticism as to any of our
acts.  Arthur was expected at five o'clock, so a little before
that time we visited the death chamber. It was so in very
truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it. The under-
taker, true to his craft, had made the best display he could
of his goods, and there was a mortuary air about the place
that lowered our spirits at once.

Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adher-
ed to, explaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very
soon, it would be less harrowing to his feelings to see all
that was left of his fiancee quite alone.

The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and
exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which
we left them the night before, so that when Arthur came such
shocks to his feelings as we could avoid were saved.

Poor fellow! He looked desperately sad and broken. Even
his stalwart manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under
the strain of his much-tried emotions. He had, I knew, been
very genuinely and devotedly attached to his father, and to
lose him, and at such a time, was a bitter blow to him. With
me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing he was sweetly
courteous. But I could not help seeing that there was some
constraint with him. The professor noticed it too, and
motioned me to bring him upstairs. I did so, and left him
at the door of the room, as I felt he would like to be
quite alone with her, but he took my arm and led me in, say-
ing huskily,

"You loved her too, old fellow. She told me all about
it, and there was no friend had a closer place in her heart
than you. I don't know how to thank you for all you have
done for her. I can't think yet. . ."

Here he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round
my shoulders and laid his head on my breast, crying, "Oh,
Jack! Jack! What shall I do? The whole of life seems gone
from me all at once, and there is nothing in the wide world
for me to live for."

I comforted him as well as I could. In such cases men
do not need much expression. A grip of the hand, the tight-
ening of an arm over the shoulder, a sob in unison, are ex-
pressions of sympathy dear to a man's heart. I stood still
and silent till his sobs died away, and then I said softly to
him, "Come and look at her."

Together we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn
from her face. God! How beautiful she was. Every hour seem-
ed to be enhancing her loveliness. It frightened and amazed
me somewhat. And as for Arthur, he fell to trembling, and
finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague.  At last, after
a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper, "Jack, is she
really dead?"

I assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to sug-
gest, for I felt that such a horrible doubt should not have
life for a moment longer than I could help, that it often
happened that after death faces become softened and even
resolved into their youthful beauty, that this was especially
so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged
suffering. I seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and af-
ter kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her
lovingly and long, he turned aside. I told him that that must
be goodbye, as the coffin had to be prepared, so he went back
and took her dead hand in his and kissed it, and bent over
and kissed her forehead. He came away, fondly looking back
over his shoulder at her as he came.

I left him in the drawing room, and told Van Helsing
that he had said goodbye, so the latter went to the kitchen
to tell the undertaker's men to proceed with the prepera-
tions and to screw up the coffin. When he came out of the
room again I told him of Arthur's question, and he replied,
"I am not surprised. Just now I doubted for a moment myself!"

We all dined together, and I could see that poor Art
was trying to make the best of things. Van Helsing had been
silent all dinner time, but when we had lit our cigars he
said, "Lord. . ., but Arthur interrupted him.

"No, no, not that, for God's sake! Not yet at any rate.
Forgive me, sir. I did not mean to speak offensively. It is
only because my loss is so recent."

The Professor answered very sweetly, "I only used that
name because I was in doubt. I must not call you `Mr.' and
I have grown to love you, yes, my dear boy, to love you, as
Arthur."

Arthur held out his hand, and took the old man's warmly.
"Call me what you will," he said. "I hope I may always have
the title of a friend. And let me say that I am at a loss
for words to thank you for your goodness to my poor dear."
He paused a moment, and went on, "I know that she understood
your goodness even better than I do. And if I was rude or in
any way wanting at that time you acted so, you remember,"--
the Professor nodded--"You must forgive me."

He answered with a grave kindness, "I know it was hard
for you to quite trust me then, for to trust such violence
needs to understand, and I take it that you do not, that you
cannot, trust me now, for you do not yet understand. And
there may be more times when I shall want you to trust when
you cannot, and may not, and must not yet understand.  But the
time will come when your trust shall be whole and complete
in me, and when you shall understand as though the sunlight
himself shone through. Then you shall bless me from first to
last for your own sake, and for the sake of others, and for
her dear sake to whom I swore to protect."

"And indeed, indeed, sir," said Arthur warmly. "I shall
in all ways trust you. I know and believe you have a very
noble heart, and you are Jack's friend, and you were hers.
You shall do what you like."

The Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as
though about to speak, and finally said, "May I ask you
something now?"

"Certainly."

"You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?"

"No, poor dear. I never thought of it."

"And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with
it as you will. I want you to give me permission to read all
Miss Lucy's papers and letters. Believe me, it is no idle
curiosity. I have a motive of which, be sure, she would have
approved. I have them all here. I took them before we knew
that all was yours, so that no strange hand might touch them,
no strange eye look through words into her soul. I shall
keep them, if I may. Even you may not see them yet, but I
shall keep them safe. No word shall be lost, and in the
good time I shall give them back to you. It is a hard thing
that I ask, but you will do it, will you not, for Lucy's
sake?"

Arthur spoke out heartily, like his old self, "Dr. Van
Helsing, you may do what you will. I feel that in saying
this I am doing what my dear one would have approved. I
shall not trouble you with questions till the time comes."

The old Professor stood up as he said solemnly, "And you
are right. There will be pain for us all, but it will not be
all pain, nor will this pain be the last. We and you too, you
most of all, dear boy, will have to pass through the bitter
water before we reach the sweet. But we must be brave of
heart and unselfish, and do our duty, and all will be well!"

I slept on a sofa in Arthur's room that night. Van Hel-
sing did not go to bed at all. He went to and fro, as if
patroling the house, and was never out of sight of the room
where Lucy lay in her coffin, strewn with the wild garlic
flowers, which sent through the odor of lily and rose, a
heavy, overpowering smell into the night.




MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


22 September.--In the train to Exeter. Jonathan sleep-
ing. It seems only yesterday that the last entry was made,
and yet how much between then, in Whitby and all the world
before me, Jonathan away and no news of him, and now, marr-
ied to Jonathan, Jonathan a solicitor, a partner, rich, mas-
ter of his business, Mr. Hawkins dead and buried, and Jona-
than with another attack that may harm him. Some day he may
ask me about it. Down it all goes. I am rusty in my short-
hand, see what unexpected prosperity does for us, so it may
be as well to freshen it up again with an exercise anyhow.

The service was very simple and very solemn. There were
only ourselves and the servants there, one or two old friends
of his from Exeter, his London agent, and a gentleman repre-
senting Sir John Paxton, the President of the Incorporated
Law Society. Jonathan and I stood hand in hand, and we felt
that our best and dearest friend was gone from us.

We came back to town quietly, taking a bus to Hyde Park
Corner. Jonathan thought it would interest me to go into
the Row for a while, so we sat down. But there were very
few people there, and it was sad-looking and desolate to see
so many empty chairs. It made us think of the empty chair at
home. So we got up and walked down Piccadilly. Jonathan was
holding me by the arm, the way he used to in the old days
before I went to school. I felt it very improper, for you
can't go on for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to
other girls without the pedantry of it biting into yourself
a bit. But it was Jonathan, and he was my husband, and we
didn't know anybody who saw us, and we didn't care if they
did, so on we walked. I was looking at a very beautiful girl,
in a big cart-wheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside Guil-
iano's, when I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he
hurt me, and he said under his breath, "My God!"

I am always anxious about Jonathan, for I fear that
some nervous fit may upset him again. So I turned to him
quickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him.

He was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as,
half in terror and half in amazement, he gazed at a tall,
thin man, with a beaky nose and black moustache and pointed
beard, who was also observing the pretty girl. He was looking
at her so hard that he did not see either of us, and so I had
a good view of him. His face was not a good face. It was
hard, and cruel, and sensual, and big white teeth, that looked
all the whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed
like an animal's. Jonathan kept staring at him, till I was
afraid he would notice. I feared he might take it ill, he
looked so fierce and nasty. I asked Jonathan why he was dis-
turbed, and he answered, evidently thinking that I knew as
much about it as he did, "Do you see who it is?"

"No, dear," I said. "I don't know him, who is it?"
His answer seemed to shock and thrill me, for it was said as
if he did not know that it was me, Mina, to whom he was
speaking. "It is the man himself!"

The poor dear was evidently terrified at something, very
greatly terrified. I do believe that if he had not had me
to lean on and to support him he would have sunk down. He
kept staring. A man came out of the shop with a small parcel,
and gave it to the lady, who then drove off. Th e dark man
kept his eyes fixed on her, and when the carriage moved up
Piccadilly he followed in the same direction, and hailed a
hansom. Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to
himself,

"I believe it is the Count, but he has grown young. My
God, if this be so! Oh, my God! My God! If only I knew! If
only I knew!" He was distressing himself so much that I fear-
ed to keep his mind on the subject by asking him any ques-
tions, so I remained silent. I drew away quietly, and he,
holding my arm, came easily. We walked a little further, and
then went in and sat for a while in the Green Park. It was
a hot day for autumn, and there was a comfortable seat in a
shady place. After a few minutes' staring at nothing, Jona-
than's eyes closed, and he went quickly into a sleep, with
his head on my shoulder. I thought it was the best thing for
him, so did not disturb him. In about twenty minutes he woke
up, and said to me quite cheerfully,

"Why, Mina, have I been asleep! Oh, do forgive me for
being so rude. Come, and we'll have a cup of tea somewhere."

He had evidently forgotten all about the dark stranger,
as in his illness he had forgotten all that this episode
had reminded him of. I don't like this lapsing into forget-
fulness. It may make or continue some injury to the brain.
I must not ask him, for fear I shall do more harm than good,
but I must somehow learn the facts of his journey abroad. The
time is come, I fear, when I must open the parcel, and know
what is written. Oh, Jonathan, you will, I know, forgive me
if I do wrong, but it is for your own dear sake.


Later.--A sad home-coming in every way, the house empty
of the dear soul who was so good to us. Jonathan still pale
and dizzy under a slight relapse of his malady, and now a
telegram from Van Helsing, whoever he may be. "You will be
grieved to hear that Mrs. Westenra died five days ago, and
that Lucy died the day before yesterday. They were both
buried today."

Oh, what a wealth of sorrow in a few words! Poor Mrs.
Westenra! Poor Lucy! Gone, gone, never to return to us!
And poor, poor Arthur, to have lost such a sweetness out of
his life! God help us all to bear our troubles.


DR. SEWARD'S DIARY-CONT.


22 September.--It is all over. Arthur has gone back to
Ring, and has taken Quincey Morris with him. What a fine
fellow is Quincey! I believe in my heart of hearts that he
suffered as much about Lucy's death as any of us, but he bore
himself through it like a moral Viking. If America can go on
breeding men like that, she will be a power in the world in-
deed. Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest preparatory
to his journey. He goes to Amsterdam tonight, but says he
returns tomorrow night, that he only wants to make some
arrangements which can only be made personally. He is to
stop with me then, if he can. He says he has work to do in
London which may take him some time. Poor old fellow! I fear
that the strain of the past week has broken down even his
iron strength.  All the time of the burial he was, I could see,
putting some terrible restraint on himself. When it was all
over, we were standing beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was
speaking of his part in the operation where his blood had
been transfused to his Lucy's veins. I could see Van Hel-
sing's face grow white and purple by turns. Arthur was
saying that he felt since then as if they two had been
really married, and that she was his wife in the sight of God.
None of us said a word of the other operations, and none of
us ever shall. Arthur and Quincey went away together to the
station, and Van Helsing and I came on here. The moment we
were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of
hysterics. He has denied to me since that it was hysterics,
and insisted that it was only his sense of humor asserting
itself under very terrible conditions. He laughed till he
cried, and I had to draw down the blinds lest any one should
see us and misjudge.  And then he cried, till he laughed again,
and laughed and cried together, just as a woman does. I tried
to be stern with him, as one is to a woman under the circum-
stances, but it had no effect. Men and women are so different
in manifestations of nervous strength or weakness! Then when
his face grew grave and stern again I asked him why his
mirth, and why at such a time. His reply was in a way char-
acteristic of him, for it was logical and forceful and mys-
terious. He said,

"Ah, you don't comprehend, friend John. Do not think
that I am not sad, though I laugh. See, I have cried even
when the laugh did choke me. But no more think that I am all
sorry when I cry, for the laugh he come just the same. Keep
it always with you that laughter who knock at your door and
say, `May I come in?' is not true laughter. No! He is a king,
and he come when and how he like. He ask no person, he choose
no time of suitability. He say, `I am here.' Behold, in ex-
ample I grieve my heart out for that so sweet young girl. I
give my blood for her, though I am old and worn. I give my
time, my skill, my sleep. I let my other sufferers want that
she may have all. And yet I can laugh at her very grave,
laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon
her coffin and say `Thud, thud!' to my heart, till it send
back the blood from my cheek. My heart bleed for that poor
boy, that dear boy, so of the age of mine own boy had I been
so blessed that he live, and with his hair and eyes the same.

"There, you know now why I love him so. And yet when
he say things that touch my husband-heart to the quick, and
make my father-heart yearn to him as to no other man, not
even you, friend John, for we are more level in experiences
than father and son, yet even at such a moment King Laugh he
come to me and shout and bellow in my ear,`Here I am! Here I
am!' till the blood come dance back and bring some of the
sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek. Oh, friend John,
it is a strange world, a sad world, a world full of miseries,
and woes, and troubles.  And yet when King Laugh come, he make
them all dance to the tune he play. Bleeding hearts, and dry
bones of the churchyard, and tears that burn as they fall,
all dance together to the music that he make with that smile-
less mouth of him. And believe me, friend John, that he is
good to come, and kind. Ah, we men and women are like ropes
drawn tight with strain that pull us different ways. Then
tears come, and like the rain on the ropes, they brace us up,
until perhaps the strain become too great, and we break. But
King Laugh he come like the sunshine, and he ease off the
strain again, and we bear to go on with our labor, what it
may be."

I did not like to wound him by pretending not to see
his idea, but as I did not yet understand the cause of his
laughter, I asked him. As he answered me his face grew
stern, and he said in quite a different tone,

"Oh, it was the grim irony of it all, this so lovely lady
garlanded with flowers, that looked so fair as life, till one
by one we wondered if she were truly dead, she laid in that
so fine marble house in that lonely churchyard, where rest so
many of her kin, laid there with the mother who loved her,
and whom she loved, and that sacred bell going "Toll! Toll!
Toll!' so sad and slow, and those holy men, with the white
garments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all
the time their eyes never on the page, and all of us with the
bowed head. And all for what? She is dead, so! Is it not?"

"Well, for the life of me, Professor," I said, "I can't
see anything to laugh at in all that. Why, your expression
makes it a harder puzzle than before. But even if the burial
service was comic, what about poor Art and his trouble? Why
his heart was simply breaking."

"Just so. Said he not that the transfusion of his blood
to her veins had made her truly his bride?"

"Yes, and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him."

"Quite so. But there was a difficulty, friend John. If
so that, then what about the others? Ho, ho! Then this so
sweet maid is a polyandrist, and me, with my poor wife dead to
me, but alive by Church's law, though no wits, all gone, even
I, who am faithful husband to this now-no-wife, am bigamist."

"I don't see where the joke comes in there either!" I
said, and I did not feel particularly pleased with him for
saying such things. He laid his hand on my arm, and said,

"Friend John, forgive me if I pain. I showed not my
feeling to others when it would wound, but only to you, my
old friend, whom I can trust. If you could have looked in-
to my heart then when I want to laugh, if you could have done
so when the laugh arrived, if you could do so now, when King
Laugh have pack up his crown, and all that is to him, for he
go far, far away from me, and for a long, long time, maybe
you would perhaps pity me the most of all."

I was touched by the tenderness of his tone, and asked
why.

"Because I know!"

And now we are all scattered, and for many a long day
loneliness will sit over our roofs with brooding wings. Lucy
lies in the tomb of her kin, a lordly death house in a lonely
churchyard, away from teeming London, where the air is fresh,
and the sun rises over Hampstead Hill, and where wild flowers
grow of their own accord.

So I can finish this diary, and God only knows if I
shall ever begin another. If I do, or if I even open this
again, it will be to deal with different people and differ-
ent themes, for here at the end, where the romance of my life
is told, ere I go back to take up the thread of my life-work,
I say sadly and without hope, "FINIS".




THE WESTMINSTER GAZETTE, 25 SEPTEMBER
A HAMPSTEAD MYSTERY


The neighborhood of Hampstead is just at present exer-
cised with a series of events which seem to run on lines
parallel to those of what was known to the writers of head-
lines and "The Kensington Horror," or "The Stabbing Woman,"
or "The Woman in Black." During the past two or three days
several cases have occurred of young children straying from
home or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath.
In all these cases the children were too young to give any
properly intelligible account of themselves, but the consen-
sus of their excuses is that they had been with a "bloofer
lady." It has always been late in the evening when they have
been missed, and on two occasions the children have not been
found until early in the following morning. It is generally
supposed in the neighborhood that, as the first child missed
gave as his reason for being away that a "bloofer lady" had
asked him to come for a walk, the others had picked up the
phrase and used it as occasion served. This is the more nat-
ural as the favorite game of the little ones at present is
luring each other away by wiles. A correspondent writes us
that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to be the"bloo-
fer lady" is supremely funny. Some of our caricaturists might,
he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing
the reality and the picture. It is only in accordance with
general principles of human nature that the "bloofer lady"
should be the popular role at these al fresco performances.
Our correspondent naively says that even Ellen Terry could
not be so winningly attractive as some of these grubby-faced
little children pretend, and even imagine themselves, to be.

There is, however, possibly a serious side to the ques-
tion, for some of the children, indeed all who have been
missed at night, have been slightly torn or wounded in the
throat. The wounds seem such as might be made by a rat or a
small dog, and although of not much importance individually,
would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has a
system or method of its own. The police of the division
have been instructed to keep a sharp lookout for straying
children, especially when very young, in and around Hamp-
stead Heath, and for any stray dog which may be about.

EXTRA SPECIAL

THE HAMPSTEAD HORROR


ANOTHER CHILD INJURED

THE "BLOOFER LADY"


We have just received intelligence that another child,
missed last night, was only discovered late in the morning
under a furze bush at the Shooter's Hill side of Hampstead
Heath, which is perhaps, less frequented than the other parts.
It has the same tiny wound in the throat as has been noticed
in other cases. It was terribly weak, and looked quite ema-
ciated. It too, when partially restored, had the common story
to tell of being lured away by the "bloofer lady".





CHAPTER 14


MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


23 September.--Jonathan is better after a bad night. I
am so glad that he has plenty of work to do, for that keeps
his mind off the terrible things, and oh, I am rejoiced that
he is not now weighed down with the responsibility of his
new position. I knew he would be true to himself, and now
how proud I am to see my Jonathan rising to the height of
his advancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties
that come upon him. He will be away all day till late, for
he said he could not lunch at home. My household work is
done, so I shall take his foreign journal, and lock myself
up in my room and read it.


24 September.--I hadn't the heart to write last night,
that terrible record of Jonathan's upset me so. Poor dear!
How he must have suffered, whether it be true or only imag-
ination. I wonder if there is any truth in it at all. Did
he get his brain fever, and then write all those terrible
things, or had he some cause for it all? I suppose I shall
never know, for I dare not open the subject to him. And yet
that man we saw yesterday! He seemed quite certain of him,
poor fellow! I suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent
his mind back on some train of thought.

He believes it all himself. I remember how on our wedd-
ing day he said "Unless some solemn duty come upon me to go
back to the bitter hours, asleep or awake, mad or sane. . ."
There seems to be through it all some thread of continuity.
That fearful Count was coming to London. If it should be,
and he came to London, with its teeming millions. . .There
may be a solemn duty, and if it come we must not shrink from
it. I shall be prepared. I shall get my typewriter this very
hour and begin transcribing. Then we shall be ready for other
eyes if required. And if it be wanted, then, perhaps, if I
am ready, poor Jonathan may not be upset, for I can speak for
him and never let him be troubled or worried with it at all.
If ever Jonathan quite gets over the nervousness he may want
to tell me of it all, and I can ask him questions and find
out things, and see how I may comfort him.




LETTER, VAN HELSING TO MRS. HARKER


24 September

(Confidence)

"Dear Madam,

"I pray you to pardon my writing, in that I am so far
friend as that I sent to you sad news of Miss Lucy Westenra's
death. By the kindness of Lord Godalming, I am empowered to
read her letters and papers, for I am deeply concerned about
certain matters vitally important. In them I find some
letters from you, which show how great friends you were and
how you love her. Oh, Madam Mina, by that love, I implore
you, help me. It is for others' good that I ask, to redress
great wrong, and to lift much and terrible troubles, that
may be more great than you can know. May it be that I see
you? You can trust me. I am friend of Dr. John Seward and
of Lord Godalming (that was Arthur of Miss Lucy). I must
keep it private for the present from all. I should come to
Exeter to see you at once if you tell me I am privilege to
come, and where and when. I implore your pardon, Madam. I
have read your letters to poor Lucy, and know how good you
are and how your husband suffer. So I pray you, if it may
be, enlighten him not, least it may harm. Again your pardon,
and forgive me.

"VAN HELSING"




TELEGRAM, MRS. HARKER TO VAN HELSING


25 September.--Come today by quarter past ten train if
you can catch it. Can see you any time you call.
"WILHELMINA HARKER"




MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


25 September.--I cannot help feeling terribly excited
as the time draws near for the visit of Dr. Van Helsing, for
somehow I expect that it will throw some light upon Jona-
than's sad experience, and as he attended poor dear Lucy in
her last illness, he can tell me all about her. That is the
reason of his coming. It is concerning Lucy and her sleep-
walking, and not about Jonathan. Then I shall never know
the real truth now! How silly I am. That awful journal gets
hold of my imagination and tinges everything with something
of its own color. Of course it is about Lucy. That habit
came back to the poor dear, and that awful night on the cliff
must have made her ill. I had almost forgotten in my own
affairs how ill she was afterwards. She must have told him
of her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew
all about it, and now he wants me to tell him what I know, so
that he may understand. I hope I did right in not saying
anything of it to Mrs. Westenra. I should never forgive my-
self if any act of mine, were it even a negative one, brought
harm on poor dear Lucy. I hope too, Dr. Van Helsing will not
blame me. I have had so much trouble and anxiety of late
that I feel I cannot bear more just at present.

I suppose a cry does us all good at times, clears the
air as other rain does. Perhaps it was reading the journal
yesterday that upset me, and then Jonathan went away this
morning to stay away from me a whole day and night, the first
time we have been parted since our marriage. I do hope the
dear fellow will take care of himself, and that nothing will
occur to upset him. It is two o'clock, and the doctor will
be here soon now. I shall say nothing of Jonathan's journal
unless he asks me. I am so glad I have typewritten out my
own journal, so that, in case he asks about Lucy, I can hand
it to him. It will save much questioning.

Later.--He has come and gone. Oh, what a strange meet-
ing, and how it all makes my head whirl round. I feel like
one in a dream. Can it be all possible, or even a part of it?
If I had not read Jonathan's journal first, I should never
have accepted even a possibility. Poor, poor, dear Jonathan!
How he must have suffered. Please the good God, all this may
not upset him again. I shall try to save him from it. But
it may be even a consolation and a help to him, terrible
though it be and awful in its consequences, to know for cer-
tain that his eyes and ears and brain did not deceive him,
and that it is all true. It may be that it is the doubt which
haunts him, that when the doubt is removed, no matter which,
waking or dreaming, may prove the truth, he will be more
satisfied and better able to bear the shock. Dr. Van Helsing
must be a good man as well as a clever one if he is Arthur's
friend and Dr. Seward's, and if they brought him all the way
from Holland to look after Lucy. I feel from having seen him
that he is good and kind and of a noble nature. When he
comes tomorrow I shall ask him about Jonathan. And then,
please God, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good
end. I used to think I would like to practice interviewing.
Jonathan's friend on "The Exeter News" told him that memory
is everything in such work, that you must be able to put
down exactly almost every word spoken, even if you had to
refine some of it afterwards. Here was a rare interview. I
shall try to record it verbatim.

It was half-past two o'clock when the knock came. I
took my courage a deux mains and waited. In a few minutes
Mary opened the door, and announced "Dr. Van Helsing".

I rose and bowed, and he came towards me, a man of med-
ium weight, strongly built, with his shoulders set back over
a broad, deep chest and a neck well balanced on the trunk as
the head is on the neck. The poise of the head strikes me at
once as indicative of thought and power. The head is noble,
well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears. The face, clean-
shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large resolute, mobile
mouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick,
sensitive nostrils, that seem to broaden as the big bushy
brows come down and the mouth tightens. The forehead is broad
and fine, rising at first almost straight and then sloping
back above two bumps or ridges wide apart, such a forehead
that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it, but
falls naturally back and to the sides. Big, dark blue eyes
are set widely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with
the man's moods. He said to me,

"Mrs. Harker, is it not?" I bowed assent.

"That was Miss Mina Murray?" Again I assented.

"It is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend
of that poor dear child Lucy Westenra. Madam Mina, it is on
account of the dead that I come."

"Sir," I said, "you could have no better claim on me
than that you were a friend and helper of Lucy Westenra."And
I held out my hand. He took it and said tenderly,

"Oh, Madam Mina, I know that the friend of that poor
little girl must be good, but I had yet to learn. . ." He
finished his speech with a courtly bow. I asked him what it
was that he wanted to see me about, so he at once began.

"I have read your letters to Miss Lucy. Forgive me, but
I had to begin to inquire somewhere, and there was none to
ask. I know that you were with her at Whitby. She sometimes
kept a diary, you need not look surprised, Madam Mina. It
was begun after you had left, and was an imitation of you,
and in that diary she traces by inference certain things to
a sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her. In
great perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your
so much kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember."

"I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about
it."

"Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details?
It is not always so with young ladies."

"No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time. I can
show it to you if you like."

"Oh, Madam Mina, I well be grateful. You will do me much
favor."

I could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a
bit, I suppose it is some taste of the original apple that
remains still in our mouths, so I handed him the shorthand
diary. He took it with a grateful bow, and said, "May I read
it?"

"If you wish," I answered as demurely as I could. He
opened it, and for an instant his face fell. Then he stood
up and bowed.

"Oh, you so clever woman!" he said. "I knew long that
Mr. Jonathan was a man of much thankfulness, but see, his
wife have all the good things.  And will you not so much honor
me and so help me as to read it for me? Alas! I know not
the shorthand."

By this time my little joke was over, and I was almost
ashamed. So I took the typewritten copy from my work basket
and handed it to him.

"Forgive me," I said. "I could not help it, but I had
been thinking that it was of dear Lucy that you wished to
ask, and so that you might not have time to wait, not on my
account, but because I know your time must be precious, I
have written it out on the typewriter for you."

He took it and his eyes glistened. "You are so good,"
he said. "And may I read it now? I may want to ask you some
things when I have read."

"By all means," I said. "read it over whilst I order
lunch, and then you can ask me questions whilst we eat."

He bowed and settled himself in a chair with his back
to the light, and became so absorbed in the papers, whilst I
went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not
be disturbed. When I came back, I found him walking hurried-
ly up and down the room, his face all ablaze with excitement.
He rushed up to me and took me by both hands.

"Oh, Madam Mina," he said, "how can I say what I owe to
you? This paper is as sunshine. It opens the gate to me. I
am dazed, I am dazzled, with so much light, and yet clouds
roll in behind the light every time. But that you do not,
cannot comprehend. Oh, but I am grateful to you, you so
clever woman. Madame," he said this very solemnly, "if ever
Abraham Van Helsing can do anything for you or yours, I trust
you will let me know. It will be pleasure and delight if I
may serve you as a friend, as a friend, but all I have ever
learned, all I can ever do, shall be for you and those you
love. There are darknesses in life, and there are lights.
You are one of the lights. You will have a happy life and a
good life, and your husband will be blessed in you."

"But, doctor, you praise me too much, and you do not
know me."

"Not know you, I, who am old, and who have studied all
my life men and women, I who have made my specialty the
brain and all that belongs to him and all that follow from
him! And I have read your diary that you have so goodly
written for me, and which breathes out truth in every line.
I, who have read your so sweet letter to poor Lucy of your
marriage and your trust, not know you! Oh, Madam Mina, good
women tell all their lives, and by day and by hour and by
minute, such things that angels can read. And we men who
wish to know have in us something of angels' eyes. Your
husband is noble nature, and you are noble too, for you
trust, and trust cannot be where there is mean nature. And
your husband, tell me of him. Is he quite well? Is all
that fever gone, and is he strong and hearty?"

I saw here an opening to ask him about Jonathan, so I
said, "He was almost recovered, but he has been greatly upset
by Mr. Hawkins death."

He interrupted, "Oh, yes. I know. I know. I have read
your last two letters."

I went on, "I suppose this upset him, for when we were
in town on Thursday last he had a sort of shock."

"A shock, and after brain fever so soon! That is not
good. What kind of shock was it?"

"He thought he saw some one who recalled something
terrible, something which led to his brain fever." And here
the whole thing seemed to overwhelm me in a rush. The pity
for Jonathan, the horror which he experienced, the whole
fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear that has been
brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult. I suppose
I was hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up
my hands to him, and implored him to make my husband well
again. He took my hands and raised me up, and made me sit
on the sofa, and sat by me. He held my hand in his, and said
to me with, oh, such infinite sweetness,

"My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work
that I have not had much time for friendships, but since I
have been summoned to here by my friend John Seward I have
known so many good people and seen such nobility that I feel
more than ever, and it has grown with my advancing years,
the loneliness of my life. Believe me, then, that I come
here full of respect for you, and you have given me hope,
hope, not in what I am seeking of, but that there are good
women still left to make life happy, good women, whose lives
and whose truths may make good lesson for the children that
are to be. I am glad, glad, that I may here be of some use
to you. For if your husband suffer, he suffer within the
range of my study and experience. I promise you that I will
gladly do all for him that I can, all to make his life strong
and manly, and your life a happy one. Now you must eat. You
are over-wrought and perhaps over-anxious. Husband Jonathan
would not like to see you so pale, and what he like not where
he love, is not to his good. Therefore for his sake you must
eat and smile. You have told me about Lucy, and so now we
shall not speak of it, lest it distress. I shall stay in Ex-
eter tonight, for I want to think much over what you have
told me, and when I have thought I will ask you questions, if
I may. And then too, you will tell me of husband Jonathan's
trouble so far as you can, but not yet. You must eat now,
afterwards you shall tell me all."

After lunch, when we went back to the drawing room, he
said to me, "And now tell me all about him."

When it came to speaking to this great learned man, I
began to fear that he would think me a weak fool, and Jona-
than a madman, that journal is all so strange, and I hesi-
tated to go on. But he was so sweet and kind, and he had
promised to help, and I trusted him, so I said,

"Dr. Van Helsing, what I have to tell you is so queer
that you must not laugh at me or at my husband. I have been
since yesterday in a sort of fever of doubt. You must be
kind to me, and not think me foolish that I have even half
believed some very strange things."

He reassured me by his manner as well as his words when
he said, "Oh, my dear, if you only know how strange is the
matter regarding which I am here, it is you who would laugh.
I have learned not to think little of any one's belief, no
matter how strange it may be. I have tried to keep an open
mind, and it is not the ordinary things of life that could
close it, but the strange things, the extraordinary things,
the things that make one doubt if they be mad or sane."

"Thank you, thank you a thousand times! You have taken
a weight off my mind. If you will let me, I shall give you
a paper to read. It is long, but I have typewritten it out.
It will tell you my trouble and Jonathan's. It is the copy of
his journal when abroad, and all that happened. I dare not
say anything of it. You will read for yourself and judge.
And then when I see you, perhaps, you will be very kind and
tell me what you think."

"I promise," he said as I gave him the papers. "I shall
in the morning, as soon as I can, come to see you and your
husband, if I may."

"Jonathan will be here at half-past eleven, and you must
come to lunch with us and see him then. You could catch the
quick 3:34 train, which will leave you at Paddington before
eight." He was surprised at my knowledge of the trains off-
hand, but he does not know that I have made up all the trains
to and from Exeter, so that I may help Jonathan in case he is
in a hurry.

So he took the papers with him and went away, and I sit
here thinking, thinking I don't know what.




LETTER (by hand), VAN HELSING TO MRS. HARKER


25 September, 6 o'clock

"Dear Madam Mina,

"I have read your husband's so wonderful diary. You may
sleep without doubt. Strange and terrible as it is, it is
true! I will pledge my life on it. It may be worse for others,
but for him and you there is no dread. He is a noble fellow,
and let me tell you from experience of men, that one who
would do as he did in going down that wall and to that room,
aye, and going a second time, is not one to be injured in
permanence by a shock. His brain and his heart are all right,
this I swear, before I have even seen him, so be at rest. I
shall have much to ask him of other things. I am blessed that
today I come to see you, for I have learn all at once so much
that again I am dazzled, dazzled more than ever, and I must
think.

"Yours the most faithful,

"Abraham Van Helsing."


LETTER, MRS. HARKER TO VAN HELSING


25 September, 6:30 P.M.

"My dear Dr. Van Helsing,

"A thousand thanks for your kind letter, which has taken
a great weight off my mind. And yet, if it be true, what
terrible things there are in the world, and what an awful
thing if that man, that monster, be really in London! I fear
to think. I have this moment, whilst writing, had a wire
from Jonathan, saying that he leaves by the 6:25 tonight from
Launceston and will be here at 10:18, so that I shall have no
fear tonight. Will you, therefore, instead of lunching with
us, please come to breakfast at eight o'clock, if this be not
too early for you? You can get away, if you are in a hurry,
by the 10:30 train, which will bring you to Paddington by
2:35. Do not answer this, as I shall take it that, if I do
not hear, you will come to breakfast.

"Believe me,

"Your faithful and grateful friend,

"Mina Harker."





JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


26 September.--I thought never to write in this diary
again, but the time has come. When I got home last night
Mina had supper ready, and when we had supped she told me of
Van Helsing's visit, and of her having given him the two
diaries copied out, and of how anxious she has been about me.
She showed me in the doctor's letter that all I wrote down
was true. It seems to have made a new man of me. It was the
doubt as to the reality of the whole thing that knocked me
over. I felt impotent, and in the dark, and distrustful. But,
now that I know, I am not afraid, even of the Count. He has
succeeded after all, then, in his design in getting to Lond-
on, and it was he I saw. He has got younger, and how? Van
Helsing is the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if he is
anything like what Mina says. We sat late, and talked it
over. Mina is dressing, and I shall call at the hotel in a
few minutes and bring him over.


He was, I think, surprised to see me. When I came into
the room whee he was, and introduced myself, he took me by
the shoulder, and turned my face round to the light, and
said, after a sharp scrutiny,

"But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you had had
a shock."

It was so funny to hear my wife called `Madam Mina' by
this kindly, strong-faced old man. I smiled, and said, "I
was ill, I have had a shock, but you have cured me already."

"And how?"

"By your letter to Mina last night. I was in doubt, and
then everything took a hue of unreality, and I did not know
what to trust, even the evidence of my own senses. Not know-
ing what to trust, I did not know what to do, and so had only
to keep on working in what had hitherto been the groove of
my life. The groove ceased to avail me, and I mistrusted
myself. Doctor, you don't know what it is to doubt everything,
even yourself. No, you don't, you couldn't with eyebrows
like yours."

He seemed pleased, and laughed as he said, "So! You are
a physiognomist. I learn more here with each hour. I am with
so much pleasure coming to you to breakfast, and, oh, sir,
you will pardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed
in your wife."

I would listen to him go on praising Mina for a day, so
I simply nodded and stood silent.

"She is one of God's women, fashioned by His own hand to
show us men and other women that there is a heaven where we
can enter, and that its light can be here on earth. So true,
so sweet, so noble, so little an egoist, and that, let me
tell you, is much in this age, so sceptical and selfish. And
you, sir. . . I have read all the letters to poor Miss Lucy,
and some of them speak of you, so I know you since some days
from the knowing of others, but I have seen your true self
since last night. You will give me your hand, will you not?
And let us be friends for all our lives."

We shook hands, and he was so earnest and so kind that
it made me quite choky.

"and now," he said, "may I ask you for some more help?
I have a great task to do, and at the beginning it is to
know. You can help me here. Can you tell me what went be-
fore your going to Transylvania? Later on I may ask more
help, and of a different kind, but at first this will do."

"Look here, Sir," I said, "does what you have to do
concern the Count?"

"It does," he said solemnly."

"Then I am with you heart and soul. As you go by the
10:30 train, you will not have time to read them, but I
shall get the bundle of papers. You can take them with you
and read them in the train."

After breakfast I saw him to the station. When we were
parting he said, "Perhaps you will come to town if I send
for you, and take Madam Mina too."

"We shall both come when you will," I said.

I had got him the morning papers and the London papers
of the previous night, and while we were talking at the
carriage window, waiting for the train to start, he was turn-
ing them over. His eyes suddenly seemed to catch something
in one of them, "The Westminster Gazette", I knew it by the
color, and he grew quite white. He read something intently,
groaning to himself, "Mein Gott! Mein Gott! So soon! So
soon!" I do not think he remembered me at the moment. Just
then the whistle blew, and the train moved off. This recalled
him to himself, and he leaned out of the window and waved
his hand, calling out, "Love to Madam Mina. I shall write so
soon as ever I can."




DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


26 September.--Truly there is no such thing as finality.
Not a week since I said "Finis," and yet here I am starting
fresh again, or rather going on with the record. Until this
afternoon I had no cause to think of what is done. Renfield
had become, to all intents, as sane as he ever was. He was
already well ahead with his fly business, and he had just
started in the spider line also, so he had not been of any
trouble to me. I had a letter from Arthur, written on Sun-
day, and from it I gather that he is bearing up wonderfully
well. Quincey Morris is with him, and that is much of a
help, for he himself is a bubbling well of good spirits.
Quincey wrote me a line too, and from him I hear that Arthur
is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy, so as
to them all my mind is at rest. As for myself, I was sett-
ling down to my work with the enthusiasm which I used to
have for it, so that I might fairly have said that the wound
which poor Lucy left on me was becoming cicatrised.

Everything is, however, now reopened, and what is to be
the end God only knows. I have an idea that Van Helsing
thinks he knows, too, but he will only let out enough at a
time to whet curiosity. He went to Exeter yesterday, and
stayed there all night. Today he came back, and almost
bounded into the room at about half-past five o'clock, and
thrust last night's "Westminster Gazette" into my hand.

"What do you think of that?" he asked as he stood back
and folded his arms.

I looked over the paper, for I really did not know what
he meant, but he took it from me and pointed out a paragraph
about children being decoyed away at Hampstead. It did not
convey much to me, until I reached a passage where it des-
cribed small puncture wounds on their throats.  An idea struck
me, and I looked up.

"Well?" he said.

"It is like poor Lucy's."

"And what do you make of it?"

"Simply that there is some cause in common. Whatever
it was that injured her has injured them." I did not quite
understand his answer.

"That is true indirectly, but not directly."

"How do you mean, Professor?" I asked. I was a little
inclined to take his seriousness lightly, for, after all,
four days of rest and freedom from burning, harrowing, anx-
iety does help to restore one's spirits, but when I saw his
face, it sobered me. Never, even in the midst of our des-
pair about poor Lucy, had he looked more stern.

"Tell me!" I said. "I can hazard no opinion. I do not
know what to think, and I have no data on which to found a
conjecture."

"Do you mean to tell me, friend John, that you have no
suspicion as to what poor Lucy died of, not after all the
hints given, not only by events, but by me?"

"Of nervous prostration following a great loss or waste
of blood."

"And how was the blood lost or wasted?" I shook my head.

He stepped over and sat down beside me, and went on, "You
are a clever man, friend John. You reason well, and your wit
is bold, but you are too prejudiced. You do not let your eyes
see nor your ears hear, and that which is outside your daily
life is not of account to you. Do you not think that there
are things which you cannot understand, and yet which are, that
some people see things that others cannot? But there are
things old and new which must not be contemplated by men's
eyes, because they know, or think they know, some things which
other men have told them. Ah, it is the fault of our science
that it wants to explain all, and if it explain not, then it
says there is nothing to explain. But yet we see around us
every day the growth of new beliefs, which think themselves
new, and which are yet but the old, which pretend to be young,
like the fine ladies at the opera. I suppose now you do not
believe in corporeal transference. No? Nor in materialization.
No? Nor in astral bodies. No? Nor in the reading of thought.
No? Nor in hypnotism. . ."

"Yes," I said. "Charcot has proved that pretty well."

He smiled as he went on, "Then you are satisfied as to
it. Yes? And of course then you understand how it act, and
can follow the mind of the great Charcot, alas that he is no
more, into the very soul of the patient that he influence. No?
Then, friend John, am I to take it that you simply accept fact,
and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion be a
blank? No? Then tell me, for I am a student of the brain,
how you accept hypnotism and reject the thought reading. Let
me tell you, my friend, that there are things done today in
electrical science which would have been deemed unholy by the
very man who discovered electricity, who would themselves not
so long before been burned as wizards. There are always mys-
teries in life. Why was it that Methuselah lived nine hundred
years, and `Old Parr'one hundred and sixty-nine, and yet that
poor Lucy, with four men's blood in her poor veins, could not
live even one day? For, had she live one more day, we could
save her. Do you know all the mystery of life and death? Do
you know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say
wherefore the qualities of brutes are in some men, and not
in others? Can you tell me why, when other spiders die small
and soon, that one great spider lived for centuries in the
tower of the old Spanish church and grew and grew, till, on
descending, he could drink the oil of all the church lamps?
Can you tell me why in the Pampas, ay and elsewhere, there are
bats that come out at night and open the veins of cattle and
horses and suck dry their veins, how in some islands of the
Western seas there are bats which hang on the trees all day,
and those who have seen describe as like giant nuts or pods,
and that when the sailors sleep on the deck, because that it
is hot, flit down on them and then, and then in the morning
are found dead men, white as even Miss Lucy was?"

"Good God, Professor!" I said, starting up. "Do you
mean to tell me that Lucy was bitten by such a bat, and that
such a thing is here in London in the nineteenth century?"

He waved his hand for silence, and went on, "Can you tell
me why the tortoise lives more long than generations of men,
why the elephant goes on and on till he have sees dynasties,
and why the parrot never die only of bite of cat of dog or
other complaint? Can you tell me why men believe in all ages
and places that there are men and women who cannot die? We
all know, because science has vouched for the fact, that there
have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of years, shut
in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth of
the world. Can you tell me how the Indian fakir can make him-
self to die and have been buried, and his grave sealed and
corn sowed on it, and the corn reaped and be cut and sown and
reaped and cut again, and then men come and take away the un-
broken seal and that there lie the Indian fakir, not dead,
but that rise up and walk amongst them as before?"

Here I interrupted him. I was getting bewildered. He
so crowded on my mind his list of nature's eccentricities and
possible impossibilities that my imagination was getting
fired. I had a dim idea that he was teaching me some lesson,
as long ago he used to do in his study at Amsterdam. But he
used them to tell me the thing, so that I could have the ob-
ject of thought in mind all the time. But now I was without
his help, yet I wanted to follow him, so I said,

"Professor, let me be your pet student again. Tell me
the thesis, so that I may apply your knowledge as you go on.
At present I am going in my mind from point to point as a
madman, and not a sane one, follows an idea. I feel like a
novice lumbering through a bog in a midst, jumping from one
tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on with-
out knowing where I am going."

"That is a good image," he said. "Well, I shall tell
you. My thesis is this, I want you to believe."

"To believe what?"

"To believe in things that you cannot. Let me illustrate.
I heard once of an American who so defined faith, `that fac-
ulty which enables us to believe things which we know to be
untrue.' For one, I follow that man. He meant that we shall
have an open mind, and not let a little bit of truth check the
rush of the big truth, like a small rock does a railway truck.
We get the small truth first. Good! We keep him, and we
value him, but all the same we must not let him think himself
all the truth in the universe."

"Then you want me not to let some previous conviction
inure the receptivity of my mind with regard to some strange
matter. Do I read your lesson aright?"

"Ah, you are my favorite pupil still. It is worth to
teach you. Now that you are willing to understand, you have
taken the first step to understand. You think then that
those so small holes in the children's throats were made by
the same that made the holes in Miss Lucy?"

"I suppose so."

He stood up and said solemnly, "Then you are wrong. Oh,
would it were so! But alas! No. It is worse, far, far worse."

"In God's name, Professor Van Helsing, what do you mean?"
I cried.

He threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair,
and placed his elbows on the table, covering his face with
his hands as he spoke.

"They were made by Miss Lucy!"




CHAPTER 15


DR. SEWARD'S DIARY-cont.


For a while sheer anger mastered me. It was as if he
had during her life struck Lucy on the face. I smote the
table hard and rose up as I said to him, "Dr. Van Helsing,
are you mad?"

He raised his head and looked at me, and somehow the
tenderness of his face calmed me at once. "Would I were!" he
said. "Madness were easy to bear compared with truth like
this. Oh, my friend, whey, think you, did I go so far round,
why take so long to tell so simple a thing? Was it because I
hate you and have hated you all my life? Was it because I
wished to give you pain? Was it that I wanted, no so late,
revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a
fearful death? Ah no!"

"Forgive me," said I.

He went on, "My friend, it was because I wished to be
gentle in the breaking to you, for I know you have loved
that so sweet lady. But even yet I do not expect you to
believe. It is so hard to accept at once any abstract truth,
that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always
believed the `no' of it. It is more hard still to accept so
sad a concrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy. Tonight
I go to prove it. Dare you come with me?"

This staggered me. A man does not like to prove such a
truth, Byron excepted from the catagory, jealousy.


"And prove the very truth he most abhorred."


He saw my hesitation, and spoke, "The logic is simple,
no madman's logic this time, jumping from tussock to tussock
in a misty bog. If it not be true, then proof will be relief.
At worst it will not harm. If it be true! Ah, there is the
dread. Yet every dread should help my cause, for in it is
some need of belief. Come, I tell you what I propose. First,
that we go off now and see that child in the hospital. Dr.
Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the papers say the
child is, is a friend of mine, and I think of yours since
you were in class at Amsterdam. He will let two scientists
see his case, if he will not let two friends. We shall tell
him nothing, but only that we wish to learn. And then. . ."

"And then?"

He took a key from his pocket and held it up. "And then
we spend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy
lies. This is the key that lock the tomb. I had it from the
coffin man to give to Arthur."

My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some
fearful ordeal before us. I could do nothing, however, so I
plucked up what heart I could and said that we had better
hasten, as the afternoon was passing.

We found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken
some food, and altogether was going on well. Dr, Vincent
took the bandage from its throat, and showed us the punct-
ures. There was no mistaking the similarity to those which
had been on Lucy's throat. They were smaller, and the edges
looked fresher, that was all. We asked Vincent to what he
attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a
bite of some animal, perhaps a rat, but for his own part, he
was inclined to think it was one of the bats which are so
numerous on the northern heights of London. "Out of so many
harmless ones," he said, "there may be some wild specimen
from the South of a more malignant species. Some sailor may
have brought one home, and it managed to escape, or even from
the Zoological Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one
be bred there from a vampire. These things do occur, you,
know. Only ten days ago a wolf got out, and was, I believe,
traced up in this direction. For a week after, the children
were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the Heath and in
every alley in the place until this `bloofer lady' scare
came along, since then it has been quite a gala time with
them. Even this poor little mite, when he woke up today,
asked the nurse if he might go away. When she asked him why
he wanted to go, he said he wanted to play with the `bloofer
lady'."

"I hope," said Van Helsing, "that when you are sending
the child home you will caution its parents to keep strict
watch over it. These fancies to stray are most dangerous,
and if the child were to remain out another night, it would
probably be fatal. But in any case I suppose you will not
let it away for some days?"

"Certainly not, not for a week at least, longer if the
wound is not healed."

Our visit to the hospital took more time than we had
reckoned on, and the sun had dipped before we came out. When
Van Helsing saw how dark it was, he said,

"There is not hurry. It is more late than I thought.
Come, let us seek somewhere that we may eat, and then we
shall go on our way."

We dined at `Jack Straw's Castle' along with a little
crowd of bicyclists and others who were genially noisy.  About
ten o'clock we started from the inn. It was then very dark,
and the scattered lamps made the darkness greater when we
were once outside their individual radius. The Professor had
evidently noted the road we were to go, for he went on un-
hesitatingly, but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as to
locality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people,
till at last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the
patrol of horse police going their usual suburban round. At
last we reached the wall of the churchyard, which we climbed
over. With some little difficulty, for it was very dark, and
the whole place seemed so strange to us, we found the West-
enra tomb. The Professor took the key, opened the creaky
door, and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously,
motioned me to precede him. There was a delicious irony in
the offer, in the courtliness of giving preference on such a
ghastly occasion. My companion followed me quickly, and
cautiously drew the door to, after carefully ascertaining
that the lock was a falling, and not a spring one. In the
latter case we should have been in a bad plight. Then he
fumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of
candle, proceeded to make a light. The tomb in the daytime,
and when wreathed with fresh flowers, had looked grim and
gruesome enough, but now, some days afterwards, when the
flowers hung lank and dead, their whites turning to rust and
their greens to browns, when the spider and the beetle had
resumed their accustomed dominance, when the time-discolored
stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and
tarnished brass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the
feeble glimmer of a candle, the effect was more miserable
and sordid than could have been imagined. It conveyed irr-
esistibly the idea that life, animal life, was not the only
thing which could pass away.

Van Helsing went about his work systematically. Hold-
ing his candle so that he could read the coffin plates, and
so holding it that the sperm dropped in white patches which
congealed as they touched the metal, he made assurance of
Lucy's coffin. Another search in his bag, and he took out a
turnscrew.

"What are you going to do?" I asked.

"To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced."

Straightway he began taking out the screws, and finally
lifted off the lid, showing the casing of lead beneath. The
sight was almost too much for me. It seemed to be as much an
affront to the dead as it would have been to have stripped
off her clothing in her sleep whilst living. I actually took
hold of his hand to stop him.

He only said, "You shall see, "and again fumbling in his
bag took out a tiny fret saw. Striking the turnscrew through
the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he
made a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit
the point of the saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the
week-old corpse. We doctors, who have had to study our dan-
gers, have to become accustomed to such things, and I drew
back towards the door. But the Professor never stopped for
a moment. He sawed down a couple of feet along one side of
the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side.
Taking the edge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards
the foot of the coffin, and holding up the candle into the
aperture, motioned to me to look.

I drew near and looked. The coffin was empty. It was
certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock,
but Van Helsing was unmoved. He was now more sure than ever
of his ground, and so emboldened to proceed in his task."Are
you satisfied now, friend John?" he asked.

I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature
awake within me as I answered him, "I am satisfied that
Lucy's body is not in that coffin, but that only proves one
thing."

"And what is that, friend John?"

"That it is not there."

"That is good logic," he said, "so far as it goes. But
how do you, how can you, account for it not being there?"

"Perhaps a body-snatcher," I suggested. "Some of the
undertaker's people may have stolen it." I felt that I was
speaking folly, and yet it was the only real cause which I
could suggest.

The Professor sighed. "Ah well!" he said," we must have
more proof. Come with me."

He put on the coffin lid again, gathered up all his
things and placed them in the bag, blew out the light, and
placed the candle also in the bag. We opened the door, and
went out. Behind us he closed the door and locked it. He
handed me the key, saying, "Will you keep it? You had better
be assured."

I laughed, it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am bound
to say, as I motioned him to keep it. "A key is nothing," I
said, "thee are many duplicates, and anyhow it is not diffi-
cult to pick a lock of this kind."

He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then
he told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he
would watch at the other.

I took up my place behind a yew tree, and I saw his
dark figure move until the intervening headstones and trees
hid it from my sight.

It was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I
heard a distant clock strike twelve, and in time came one and
two. I was chilled and unnerved, and angry with the Professor
for taking me on such an errand and with myself for coming.
I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly observant, and not
sleepy enough to betray my trust, so altogether I had a
dreary, miserable time.

Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something
like a white streak, moving between two dark yew trees at the
side of the churchyard farthest from the tomb. At the same
time a dark mass moved from the Professor's side of the
ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then I too moved, but
I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and I
stumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far
off an early cock crew. A little ways off, beyond a line of
scattered juniper trees, which marked the pathway to the
church, a white dim figure flitted in the direction of the
tomb. The tomb itself was hidden by trees, and I could not
see where the figure had disappeared. I heard the rustle of
actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and
coming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny
child. When he saw me he held it out to me, and said, "Are
you satisfied now?"

"No," I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.

"Do you not see the child?"

"Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it
wounded?"

"We shall see," said the Professor, and with one impulse
we took our way out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleep-
ing child.

When we had got some little distance away, we went into
a clump of trees, and struck a match, and looked at the
child's throat. It was without a scratch or scar of any kind.

"Was I right?" I asked triumphantly.

"We were just in time," said the Professor thankfully.

We had now to decide what we were to do with the child,
and so consulted about it. If we were to take it to a police
station we should have to give some account of our movements
during the night. At least, we should have had to make some
statement as to how we had come to find the child. So finally
we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we
heard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not
fail to find it. We would then seek our way home as quickly
as we could. All fell out well. At the edge of Hampstead
Heath we heard a policeman's heavy tramp, and laying the
child on the pathway, we waited and watched until he saw it
as he flashed his lantern to and fro. We heard his exclam-
ation of astonishment, and then we went away silently. By
good chance we got a cab near the `Spainiards,' and drove to
town.

I cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to
get a few hours' sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at
noon. He insists that I go with him on another expedition.


27 September.--It was two o'clock before we found a
suitable opportunity for our attempt. The funeral held at
noon was all completed, and the last stragglers of the mour-
ners had taken themselves lazily away, when, looking care-
fully from behind a clump of alder trees, we saw the sexton
lock the gate after him. We knew that we were safe till
morning did we desire it, but the Professor told me that we
should not want more than an hour at most. Again I felt that
horrid sense of the reality of things, in which any effort of
imagination seemed out of place, and I realized distinctly
the perils of the law which we were incurring in our unhal-
lowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so useless. Outrag-
eous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman
dead nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height
of folly to open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evi-
dence of our own eyesight, that the coffin was empty. I
shrugged my shoulders, however, and rested silent, for Van
Helsing had a way of going on his own road, no matter who
remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and again
courteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so
gruesome as last night, but oh, how unutterably mean looking
when the sunshine streamed in. Van Helsing walked over to
Lucy's coffin, and I followed. He bent over and again forced
back the leaden flange, and a shock of surprise and dismay
shot through me.

There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the
night before her funeral. She was, if possible, more radi-
antly beautiful than ever, and I could not believe that she
was dead. The lips were red, nay redder than before, and
on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.

"Is this a juggle?" I said to him.

"Are you convinced now?" said the Professor, in response,
and as he spoke he put over his hand, and in a way that made
me shudder, pulled back the dead lips and showed the white
teeth. "See," he went on, "they are even sharper than before.
With this and this," and he touched one of the canine teeth
and that below it, "the little children can be bitten. Are
you of belief now, friend John?"

Once more argumentative hostility woke within me. I
could not accept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested.
So, with an attempt to argue of which I was even at the mom-
ent ashamed, I said, "She may have been placed here since
last night."

"Indeed? That is so, and by whom?"

"I do not know. Someone has done it."

"And yet she has been dead one week. Most peoples in
that time would not look so."

I had no answer for this, so was silent. Van Helsing
did not seem to notice my silence. At any rate, he showed
neither chagrin nor triumph. He was looking intently at the
face of the dead woman, raising the eyelids and looking at
the eyes, and once more opening the lips and examining the
teeth. Then he turned to me and said,

"Here, there is one thing which is different from all
recorded. Here is some dual life that is not as the common.
She was bitten by the vampire when she was in a trance,
sleep-walking, oh, you start. You do not know that, friend
John, but you shall know it later, and in trance could he
best come to take more blood. In trance she dies, and in
trance she is Un-Dead, too. So it is that she differ from
all other. Usually when the Un-Dead sleep at home," as he
spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of his arm to designate
what to a vampire was `home', "their face show what they are,
but this so sweet that was when she not Un-Dead she go back
to the nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there,
see, and so it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep."

This turned my blood cold, and it began to dawn upon me
that I was accepting Van Helsing's theories. But if she were
really dead, what was there of terror in the idea of killing
her?

He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in my
face, for he said almost joyously, "Ah, you believe now?"

I answered, "Do not press me too hard all at once. I am
willing to accept. How will you do this bloody work?"

"I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with gar-
lic, and I shall drive a stake through her body."

It made me shudder to think of so mutilating the body
of the woman whom I had loved. And yet the feeling was not
so strong as I had expected. I was, in fact, beginning to
shudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van
Helsing called it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that
love is all subjective, or all objective?

I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin,
but he stood as if wrapped in thought. Presently he closed
the catch of his bag with a snap, and said,

"I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to
what is best. If I did simply follow my inclining I would
do now, at this moment, what is to be done. But there are
other things to follow, and things that are thousand times
more difficult in that them we do not know. This is simple.
She have yet no life taken, though that is of time, and to
act now would be to take danger from her forever. But then
we may have to want Arthur, and how shall we tell him of
this? If you, who saw the wounds on Lucy's throat, and saw
the wounds so similar on the child's at the hospital, if you,
who saw the coffin empty last night and full today with a
woman who have not change only to be more rose and more beau-
tiful in a whole week, after she die, if you know of this and
know of the white figure last night that brought the child
to the churchyard, and yet of your own senses you did not
believe, how then, can I expect Arthur, who know none of
those things, to believe?

"He doubted me when I took him from her kiss when she
was dying. I know he has forgiven me because in some mis-
taken idea I have done things that prevent him say goodbye
as he ought, and he may think that in some more mistaken
idea this woman was buried alive, and that in most mistake
of all we have killed her. He will then argue back that it
is we, mistaken ones, that have killed her by our ideas, and
so he will be much unhappy always. Yet he never can be sure,
and that is the worst of all. And he will sometimes think
that she he loved was buried alive, and that will paint his
dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered, and again,
he will think that we may be right, and that his so beloved
was, after all, an Un-Dead. No! I told him once, and since
then I learn much. Now, since I know it is all true, a hun-
dred thousand times more do I know that he must pass through
the bitter waters to reach the sweet. He, poor fellow, must
have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow
black to him, then we can act for good all round and send him
peace. My mind is made up. Let us go. You return home for
tonight to your asylum, and see that all be well. As for me,
I shall spend the night here in this churchyard in my own
way. Tomorrow night you will come to me to the Berkeley
Hotel at ten of the clock. I shall send for Arthur to come
too, and also that so fine young man of America that gave his
blood. Later we shall all have work to do. I come with you
so far as Piccadilly and there dine, for I must be back here
before the sun set."

So we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the
wall of the churchyard, which was not much of a task, and
drove back to Piccadilly.




NOTE LEFT BY VAN HELSING IN HIS PORTMANTEAU, BERKELEY HOTEL
DIRECTED TO JOHN SEWARD, M. D.
(Not Delivered)


27 September

"Friend John,

"I write this in case anything should happen. I go alone
to watch in that churchyard. It pleases me that the Un-Dead,
Miss Lucy, shall not leave tonight, that so on the morrow
night she may be more eager. Therefore I shall fix some
things she like not, garlic and a crucifix, and so seal up
the door of the tomb. She is young as Un-Dead, and will heed.
Moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out. They may
not prevail on her wanting to get in, for then the Un-Dead
is desperate, and must find the line of least resistance,
whatsoever it may be. I shall be at hand all the night from
sunset till after sunrise, and if there be aught that may be
learned I shall learn it. For Miss Lucy or from her, I have
no fear, but that other to whom is there that she is Un-Dead,
he have not the power to seek her tomb and find shelter. He
is cunning, as I know from Mr. Jonathan and from the way
that all along he have fooled us when he played with us for
Miss Lucy's life, and we lost, and in many ways the Un-Dead
are strong. He have always the strength in his hand of
twenty men, even we four who gave our strength to Miss Lucy
it also is all to him. Besides, he can summon his wolf and
I know not what. So if it be that he came thither on this
night he shall find me. But none other shall, until it be
too late. But it may be that he will not attempt the place.
There is no reason why he should. His hunting ground is
more full of game than the churchyard where the Un-Dead wo-
man sleeps, and the one old man watch.

"Therefore I write this in case. . .Take the papers
that are with this, the diaries of Harker and the rest, and
read them, and then find this great Un-Dead, and cut off
his head and burn his heart or drive a stake through it, so
that the world may rest from him.

"If it be so, farewell.

"VAN HELSING."




DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


28 September.--It is wonderful what a good night's
sleep will do for one. Yesterday I was almost willing to
accept Van Helsing's monstrous ideas, but now they seem to
start out lurid before me as outrages on common sense. I have
no doubt that he believes it all. I wonder if his mind can
have become in any way unhinged. Surely there must be some
rational explanation of all these mysterious things. Is it
possible that the Professor can have done it himself? He is
so abnormally clever that if he went off his head he would
carry out his intent with regard to some fixed idea in a won-
derful way. I am loathe to think it, and indeed it would be
almost as great a marvel as the other to find that Van Hel-
sing was mad, but anyhow I shall watch him carefully. I may
get some light on the mystery.


29 September.--Last night, at a little before ten
o'clock, Arthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing's room. He
told us all what he wanted us to do, but especially address-
ing himself to Arthur, as if all our wills were centered in
his. He began by saying that he hoped we would all come with
him too, "for," he said, "there is a grave duty to be done
there. You were doubtless surprised at my letter?" This
query was directly addressed to Lord Godalming.

"I was. It rather upset me for a bit. There has been so
much trouble around my house of late that I could do without
any more. I have been curious, too, as to what you mean.

"Quincey and I talked it over, but the more we talked,
the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myself that
I'm about up a tree as to any meaning about anything."

"Me too," said Quincey Morris laconically.

"Oh," said the Professor, "then you are nearer the be-
ginning, both of you, than friend John here, who has to go
a long way back before he can even get so far as to begin."

It was evident that he recognized my return to my old
doubting frame of mind without my saying a word. Then, turn-
ing to the other two, he said with intense gravity,

"I want your permission to do what I think good this
night. It is, I know, much to ask, and when you know what
it is I propose to do you will know, and only then how much.
Therefore may I ask that you promise me in the dark, so that
afterwards, though you may be angry with me for a time, I
must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may
be, you shall not blame yourselves for anything."

"That's frank anyhow," broke in Quincey. "I'll answer
for the Professor. I don't quite see his drift, but I swear
he's honest, and that's good enough for me."

"I thank you, Sir," said Van Helsing proudly. "I have
done myself the honor of counting you one trusting friend,
and such endorsement is dear to me." He held out a hand,
which Quincey took.

Then Arthur spoke out, "Dr. Van Helsing, I don't quite
like to `buy a pig in a poke', as they say in Scotland, and
if it be anything in which my honour as a gentleman or my
faith as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make such a pro-
mise. If you can assure me that what you intend does not
violate either of these two, then I give my consent at once,
though for the life of me, I cannot understand what you are
driving at."

"I accept your limitation," said Van Helsing, "and all
I ask of you is that if you feel it necessary to condemn
any act of mine, you will first consider it well and be
satisfied that it does not violate your reservations."

"Agreed!" said Arthur. "That is only fair. And now
that the pourparlers are over, may I ask what it is we are
to do?"

"I want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to
the churchyard at Kingstead."

Arthur's face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way,

"Where poor Lucy is buried?"

The Professor bowed.

Arthur went on, "And when there?"

"To enter the tomb!"

Arthur stood up. "Professor, are you in earnest, or is
it some monstrous joke? Pardon me, I see that you are in
earnest." He sat down again, but I could see that he sat
firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity. There was
silence until he asked again, "And when in the tomb?"

"To open the coffin."

"This is too much!" he said, angrily rising again. "I
am willing to be patient in all things that are reasonable,
but in this, this desecration of the grave, of one who. . ."
He fairly choked with indignation.

The Professor looked pityingly at him."If I could spare
you one pang, my poor friend," he said, "God knows I would.
But this night our feet must tread in thorny paths, or later,
and for ever, the feet you love must walk in paths of
flame!"

Arthur looked up with set white face and said, "Take
care, sir, take care!"

"Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?" said
Van Helsing. "And then you will at least know the limit of
my purpose. Shall I go on?"

"That's fair enough," broke in Morris.

After a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with an
effort, "Miss Lucy is dead, is it not so? Yes! Then there
can be no wrong to her. But if she be not dead. . ."

Arthur jumped to his feet, "Good God!" he cried. "What
do you mean? Has there been any mistake, has she been buried
alive?" He groaned in anguish that not even hope could soften.

"I did not say she was alive, my child. I did not think
it. I go no further than to say that she might be Un-Dead."

"Un-Dead! Not alive! What do you mean? Is this all a
nightmare, or what is it?"

"There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which
age by age they may solve only in part. Believe me, we are
now on the verge of one. But I have not done. May I cut off
the head of dead Miss Lucy?"

"Heavens and earth, no!" cried Arthur in a storm of
passion. "Not for the wide world will I consent to any
mutilation of her dead body. Dr. Van Helsing, you try me
too far. What have I done to you that you should torture
me so? What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should
want to cast such dishonor on her grave? Are you mad, that
you speak of such things, or am I mad to listen to them?
Don't dare think more of such a desecration. I shall not
give my consent to anything you do. I have a duty to do in
protecting her grave from outrage, and by God, I shall do it!"

Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been
seated, and said, gravely and sternly, "My Lord Godalming, I
too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a duty to you, a
duty to the dead, and by God, I shall do it! All I ask you
now is that you come with me, that you look and listen, and
if when later I make the same request you do not be more
eager for its fulfillment even than I am, then, I shall do my
duty, whatever it may seem to me. And then, to follow your
Lordship's wishes I shall hold myself at your disposal to
render an account to you, when and where you will." His voice
broke a little, and he went on with a voice full of pity.

"But I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me. In
a long life of acts which were often not pleasant to do, and
which sometimes did wring my heart, I have never had so heavy
a task as now. Believe me that if the time comes for you to
change your mind towards me, one look from you will wipe away
all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can to save
you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myself
so much labor and so much of sorrow? I have come here from
my own land to do what I can of good, at the first to please
my friend John, and then to help a sweet young lady, whom too,
I come to love. For her, I am ashamed to say so much, but I
say it in kindness, I gave what you gave, the blood of my
veins. I gave it, I who was not, like you, her lover, but
only her physician and her friend. I gave her my nights and
days, before death, after death, and if my death can do her
good even now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have
it freely." He said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and
Arthur was much affected by it.

He took the old man's hand and said in a broken voice,
"Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand, but
at least I shall go with you and wait."





CHAPTER 16


DR SEWARD'S DIARY-cont.


It was just a quarter before twelve o'clock when we got
into the churchyard over the low wall. The night was dark
with occasional gleams of moonlight between the dents of the
heavy clouds that scudded across the sky. We all kept some-
how close together, with Van Helsing slightly in front as he
led the way. When we had come close to the tomb I looked well
at Arthur, for I feared the proximity to a place laden with
so sorrowful a memory would upset him, but he bore himself
well. I took it that the very mystery of the proceeding was
in some way a counteractant to his grief. The Professor un-
locked the door, and seeing a natural hesitation amongst us
for various reasons, solved the difficulty by entering first
himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed the door. He
then lit a dark lantern and pointed to a coffin.  Arthur step-
ped forward hesitatingly. Van Helsing said to me, "You were
with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in that
coffin?"

"It was."

The Professor turned to the rest saying, "You hear, and
yet there is no one who does not believe with me.'

He took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of
the coffin. Arthur looked on, very pale but silent. When
the lid was removed he stepped forward. He evidently did not
know that there was a leaden coffin, or at any rate, had not
thought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead, the blood
rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away
again, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness. He was
still silent. Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and
we all looked in and recoiled.

The coffin was empty!

For several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence
was broken by Quincey Morris, "Professor, I answered for you.
Your word is all I want. I wouldn't ask such a thing ordin-
arily, I wouldn't so dishonor you as to imply a doubt, but
this is a mystery that goes beyond any honor or dishonor. Is
this your doing?"

"I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have
not removed or touched her. What happened was this. Two
nights ago my friend Seward and I came here, with good pur-
pose, believe me. I opened that coffin, which was then sealed
up, and we found it as now, empty. We then waited, and saw
something white come through the trees. The next day we came
here in daytime and she lay there. Did she not, friend John?

"Yes."

"That night we were just in time. One more so small
child was missing, and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst
the graves. Yesterday I came here before sundown, for at sun-
down the Un-Dead can move. I waited here all night till the
sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most probable that it
was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic,
which the Un-Dead cannot bear, and other things which they
shun. Last night there was no exodus, so tonight before the
sundown I took away my garlic and other things. And so it is
we find this coffin empty. But bear with me. So far there is
much that is strange. Wait you with me outside, unseen and
unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be. So," here he
shut the dark slide of his lantern, "now to the outside." He
opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking
the door behind him.

Oh! But it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after
the terror of that vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds
race by, and the passing gleams of the moonlight between the
scudding clouds crossing and passing, like the gladness and
sorrow of a man's life. How sweet it was to breathe the fresh
air, that had no taint of death and decay. How humanizing to
see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to hear
far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great
city. Each in his own way was solemn and overcome. Arthur
was silent, and was, I could see, striving to grasp the pur-
pose and the inner meaning of the mystery. I was myself tol-
erably patient, and half inclined again to throw aside doubt
and to accept Van Helsing's conclusions. Quincey Morris was
phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and
accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of
all he has at stake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself
a good-sized plug of tobacco and began to chew. As to Van
Helsing, he was employed in a definite way. First he took
from his bag a mass of what looked like thin, wafer-like
biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white napkin.
Next he took out a double handful of some whitish stuff, like
dough or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it
into the mass between his hands. This he then took, and roll-
ing it into thin strips, began to lay them into the crevices
between the door and its setting in the tomb. I was some-
what puzzled at this, and being close, asked him what it was
that he was doing. Arthur and Quincey drew near also, as they
too were curious.

He answered, "I am closing the tomb so that the Un-Dead
may not enter."

"And is that stuff you have there going to do it?"

"It Is."

"What is that which you are using?" This time the ques-
tion was by Arthur. Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat
as he answered.

"The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have an In-
dulgence."

It was an answer that appalled the most sceptical of
us, and we felt individually that in the presence of such
earnest purpose as the Professor's, a purpose which could
thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was impossible
to distrust. In respectful silence we took the places assign-
ed to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of
any one approaching. I pitied the others, especially Arthur.
I had myself been apprenticed by my former visits to this
watching horror, and yet I, who had up to an hour ago repud-
iated the proofs, felt my heart sink within me. Never did
tombs look so ghastly white. Never did cypress, or yew, or
juniper so seem the embodiment of funeral gloom. Never did
tree or grass wave or rustle so ominously. Never did bough
creak so mysteriously, and never did the far-away howling of
dogs send such a woeful presage through the night.

There was a long spell of silence, big, aching, void,
and then from the Professor a keen "S-s-s-s!" He pointed,
and far down the avenue of yews we saw a white figure ad-
vance, a dim white figure, which held something dark at its
breast. The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of moon-
light fell upon the masses of driving clouds, and showed in
startling prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the
cerements of the grave. We could not see the face, for it
was bent down over what we saw to be a fair-haired child.
There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a child
gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and
dreams. We were starting forward, but the Professor's warn-
ing hand, seen by us as he stood behind a yew tree, kept us
back. And then as we looked the white figure moved forwards
again. It was now near enough for us to see clearly, and the
moonlight still held. My own heart grew cold as ice, and I
could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognized the features
of Lucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The
sweetness was turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and
the purity to voluptuous wantonness.

Van Helsing stepped out, and obedient to his gesture, we
all advanced too. The four of us ranged in a line before the
door of the tomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew
the slide. By the concentrated light that fell on Lucy's
face we could see that the lips were crimson with fresh
blood, and that the stream had trickled over her chin and
stained the purity of her lawn death robe.

We shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous
light that even Van Helsing's iron nerve had failed. Arthur
was next to me, and if I had not seized his arm and held him
up, he would have fallen.

When Lucy, I call the thing that was before us Lucy be-
cause it bore her shape, saw us she drew back with an angry
snarl, such as a cat gives when taken unawares, then her eyes
ranged over us. Lucy's eyes in form and color, but Lucy's
eyes unclean and full of hell fire, instead of the pure,
gentle orbs we knew. At that moment the remnant of my love
passed into hate and loathing. Had she then to be killed, I
could have done it with savage delight. As she looked, her
eyes blazed with unholy light, and the face became wreathed
with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God, how it made me shudder to
see it! With a careless motion, she flung to the ground,
callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had clutched
strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls
over a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moan-
ing. There was a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a
groan from Arthur. When she advanced to him with outstretched
arms and a wanton smile he fell back and hid his face in his
hands.

She still advanced, however, and with a languorous, vol-
uptuous grace, said, "Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others
and come to me. My arms are hungry for you. Come, and we can
rest together. Come, my husband, come!"

There was something diabolically sweet in her tones,
something of the tinkling of glass when struck, which rang
through the brains even of us who heard the words addressed
to another.

As for Arthur, he seemed under a spell, moving his hands
from his face, he opened wide his arms. She was leaping for
them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held between them
his little golden crucifix. She recoiled from it, and, with
a suddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as
if to enter the tomb.

When within a foot or two of the door, however, she stop-
ped, as if arrested by some irresistible force. Then she
turned, and her face was shown in the clear burst of moon-
light and by the lamp, which had now no quiver from Van Hel-
sing's nerves. Never did I see such baffled malice on a face,
and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by mortal
eyes. The beautiful color became livid, the eyes seemed to
throw out sparks of hell fire, the brows were wrinkled as
though the folds of flesh were the coils of Medusa's snakes,
and the lovely, blood-stained mouth grew to an open square,
as in the passion masks of the Greeks and Japanese. If ever
a face meant death, if looks could kill, we saw it at that
moment.

And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity,
se remained between the lifted crucifix and the sacred clos-
ing of her means of entry.

Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur, "Answer
me, oh my friend! Am I to proceed in my work?"

"Do as you will, friend. Do as you will. There can be
no horror like this ever any more." And he groaned in spirit.

Quincey and I simultaneously moved towards him, and took
his arms. We could hear the click of the closing lantern as
Van Helsing held it down. Coming close to the tomb, he began
to remove from the chinks some of the sacred emblem which he
had placed there. We all looked on with horrified amazement
as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal
body as real at that moment as our own, pass through the
interstice where scarce a knife blade could have gone. We all
felt a glad sense of relief when we saw the Professor calmly
restoring the strings of putty to the edges of the door.

When this was done, he lifted the child and said, "Come
now, my friends. We can do no more till tomorrow. There is
a funeral at noon, so here we shall all come before long
after that. The friends of the dead will all be gone by two,
and when the sexton locks the gate we shall remain. Then
there is more to do, but not like this of tonight. As for
this little one, he is not much harmed, and by tomorrow
night he shall be well. We shall leave him where the police
will find him, as on the other night, and then to home."

Coming close to Arthur, he said, "My friend Arthur, you
have had a sore trial, but after, when you look back, you
will see how it was necessary. You are now in the bitter
waters, my child. By this time tomorrow you will, please
God, have passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters.
So do not mourn over-much. Till then I shall not ask you to
forgive me."

Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to
cheer each other on the way. We had left behind the child
in safety, and were tired. So we all slept with more or less
reality of sleep.


29 September, night.--A little before twelve o'clock we
three, Arthur, Quincey Morris, and myself, called for the
Professor. It was odd to notice that by common consent we
had all put on black clothes. Of course, Arthur wore black,
for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of us wore it by
instinct. We got to the graveyard by half-past one, and
strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that
when the gravediggers had completed their task and the sex-
ton under the belief that every one had gone, had locked the
gate, we had the place all to ourselves. Van Helsing, instead
of his little black bag, had with him a long leather one, some-
thing like a cricketing bag. It was manifestly of fair weight.

When we were alone and had heard the last of the foot-
steps die out up the road, we silently, and as if by ordered
intention, followed the Professor to the tomb. He unlocked
the door, and we entered, closing it behind us. Then he took
from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and also two wax
candles, which, when lighted, he stuck by melting their own
ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light suff-
icient to work by. When he again lifted the lid off Lucy's
coffin we all looked, Arthur trembling like an aspen, and saw
that the corpse lay there in all its death beauty. But there
was no love in my own heart, nothing but loathing for the
foul Thing which had taken Lucy's shape without her soul. I
could see even Arthur's face grow hard as he looked. Present-
ly he said to Van Helsing, "Is this really Lucy's body, or
only a demon in her shape?"

"It is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and
you shall see her as she was, and is."

She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there,
the pointed teeth, the blood stained, voluptuous mouth,
which made one shudder to see, the whole carnal and unspirit-
ed appearance, seeming like a devilish mockery of Lucy's
sweet purity. Van Helsing, with his usual methodicalness,
began taking the various contents from his bag and placing
them ready for use. First he took out a soldering iron and
some plumbing solder, and then small oil lamp, which gave out,
when lit in a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at a
fierce heat with a blue flame, then his operating knives,
which he placed to hand, and last a round wooden stake, some
two and a half or three inches thick and about three feet
long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire,
and was sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a
heavy hammer, such as in households is used in the coal
cellar for breaking the lumps. To me, a doctor's preperations
for work of any kind are stimulating and bracing, but the
effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was to
cause them a sort of consternation. They both, however, kept
their courage, and remained silent and quiet.

When all was ready, Van Helsing said, "Before we do any-
thing, let me tell you this. It is out of the lore and ex-
perience of the ancients and of all those who have studied
the powers of the Un-Dead. When they become such, there comes
with the change the curse of immortality. They cannot die,
but must go on age after age adding new victims and multi-
plying the evils of the world. For all that die from the
preying of the Un-dead become themselves Un-dead, and prey on
their kind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as
the ripples from a stone thrown in the water. Friend Arthur,
if you had met that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy
die, or again, last night when you open your arms to her, you
would in time, when you had died, have become nosferatu, as
they call it in Eastern europe, and would for all time make
more of those Un-Deads that so have filled us with horror.
The career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun.
Those children whose blood she sucked are not as yet so much
the worse, but if she lives on, Un-Dead, more and more they
lose their blood and by her power over them they come to her,
and so she draw their blood with that so wicked mouth.  But if
she die in truth, then all cease. The tiny wounds of the
throats disappear, and they go back to their play unknowing
ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, when
this now Un-Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul
of the poor lady whom we love shall again be free. Instead of
working wickedness by night and growing more debased in the
assimilating of it by day, she shall take her place with the
other Angels. So that, my friend, it will be a blessed hand
for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free. To
this I am willing, but is there none amongst us who has a
better right? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the
silence of the night when sleep is not, `It was my hand that
sent her to the stars. It was the hand of him that loved her
best, the hand that of all she would herself have chosen, had
it been to her to choose?' Tell me if there be such a one
amongst us?"

We all looked at Arthur. He saw too, what we all did,
the infinite kindness which suggested that his should be the
hand which would restore Lucy to us as a holy, and not an
unholy, memory. He stepped forward and said bravely, though
his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as snow, "My true
friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you. Tell
me what I am to do, and I shall not falter!"

Van Helsing laid a hand on his shoulder, and said, "Brave
lad! A moment's courage, and it is done. This stake must be
driven through her. It well be a fearful ordeal, be not de-
ceived in that, but it will be only a short time, and you
will then rejoice more than your pain was great. From this
grim tomb you will emerge as though you tread on air. But
you must not falter when once you have begun. Only think that
we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for
you all the time."

"Go on," said Arthur hoarsely."Tell me what I am to do."

"Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place to
the point over the heart, and the hammer in your right. Then
when we begin our prayer for the dead, I shall read him, I
have here the book, and the others shall follow, strike in
God's name, that so all may be well with the dead that we
love and that the Un-Dead pass away."

Arthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his
mind was set on action his hands never trembled nor even
quivered. Van Helsing opened his missal and began to read,
and Quincey and I followed as well as we could.

Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked
I could see its dint in the white flesh. Then he struck with
all his might.

The thing in the coffin writhed, and a hideous, blood-
curdling screech came from the opened red lips. The body
shook and quivered and twisted in wild contortions. The
sharp white champed together till the lips were cut, and the
mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But Arthur never fal-
tered. He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling
arm rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-
bearing stake, whilst the blood from the pierced heart well-
ed and spurted up around it. His face was set, and high
duty seemed to shine through it. The sight of it gave us
courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little
vault.

And then the writhing and quivering of the body became
less, and the teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver.
Finally it lay still. The terrible task was over.

The hammer fell from Arthur's hand. He reeled and would
have fallen had we not caught him. The great drops of sweat
sprang from his forehead, and his breath came in broken gasps.
It had indeed been an awful strain on him, and had he not
been forced to his task by more than human considerations he
could never have gone through with it. For a few minutes we
were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the
coffin. When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise
ran from one to the other of us. We gazed so eagerly that
Arthur rose, for he had been seated on the ground, and came
and looked too, and then a glad strange light broke over his
face and dispelled altogether the gloom of horror that lay
upon it.

There, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that
we has so dreaded and grown to hate that the work of her de-
struction was yielded as a privilege to the one best entit-
led to it, but Lucy as we had seen her in life, with her face
of unequalled sweetness and purity. True that there were
there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and
pain and waste. But these were all dear to us, for they
marked her truth to what we knew. One and all we felt that
the holy calm that lay like sunshine over the wasted face
and form was only an earthly token and symbol of the calm
that was to reign for ever.

Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur's shoulder,
and said to him, "And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I
not forgiven?"

The reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the
old man's hand in his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it,
and said, "Forgiven! God bless you that you have given my
dear one her soul again, and me peace." He put his hands on
the Professor's shoulder, and laying his head on his breast,
cried for a while silently, whilst we stood unmoving.

When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him, "And
now, my child, you may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you
will, as she would have you to, if for her to choose. For
she is not a grinning devil now, not any more a foul Thing
for all eternity. No longer she is the devil's Un-Dead. She
is God's true dead, whose soul is with Him!"

Arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and
Quincey out of the tomb. The Professor and I sawed the top
off the stake, leaving the point of it in the body. Then we
cut off the head and filled the mouth with garlic. We sold-
ered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin lid, and
gathering up our belongings, came away. When the Professor
locked the door he gave the key to Arthur.

Outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds
sang, and it seemed as if all nature were tuned to a differ-
ent pitch. There was gladness and mirth and peace everywhere,
for we were at rest ourselves on one account, and we were
glad, though it was with a tempered joy.

Before we moved away Van Helsing said, "Now, my friends,
one step or our work is done, one the most harrowing to our-
selves. But there remains a greater task, to find out the
author of all this or sorrow and to stamp him out. I have
clues which we can follow, but it is a long task, and a diff-
icult one, and there is danger in it, and pain. Shall you not
all help me? We have learned to believe, all of us, is it
not so? And since so, do we not see our duty? Yes! And do
we not promise to go on to the bitter end?"

Each in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made.
Then said the Professor as we moved off, "Two nights hence
you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of the
clock with friend John. I shall entreat two others, two that
you know not as yet, and I shall be ready to all our work
show and our plans unfold. Friend John, you come with me
home, for I have much to consult you about, and you can help
me. Tonight I leave for Amsterdam, but shall return tomorrow
night. And then begins our great quest. But first I shall
have much to say, so that you may know what to do and to
dread. Then our promise shall be made to each other anew. For
there is a terrible task before us, and once our feet are on
the ploughshare we must not draw back."





CHAPTER 17


DR. SEWARD'S DIARY-cont


When we arrived at the Berkely Hotel, Van Helsing found
a telegram waiting for him.

"Am coming up by train. Jonathan at Whitby. Important
news. Mina Harker."


The Professor was delighted. "Ah, that wonderful Madam
Mina," he said, "pearl among women! She arrive, but I can-
not stay. She must go to your house, friend John. You must
meet her at the station. Telegraph her en route so that she
may be prepared."

When the wire was dispatched he had a cup of tea. Over
it he told me of a diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad,
and gave me a typewritten copy of it, as also of Mrs. Harker's
diary at Whitby. "Take these," he said, "and study them well.
When I have returned you will be master of all the facts,
and we can then better enter on our inquisition. Keep them
safe, for there is in them much of treasure. You will need
all your faith, even you who have had such an experience as
that of today. What is here told," he laid his hand heavily
and gravely on the packet of papers as he spoke, "may be the
beginning of the end to you and me and many another, or it
may sound the knell of the Un-Dead who walk the earth. Read
all, I pray you, with the open mind, and if you can add in
any way to the story here told do so, for it is all import-
ant. You have kept a diary of all these so strange things,
is it not so? Yes! Then we shall go through all these to-
gether when we meet." He then made ready for his departure
and shortly drove off to Liverpool Street. I took my way to
Paddington, where I arrived about fifteen minutes before the
train came in.

The crowd melted away, after the bustling fashion com-
mon to arrival platforms, and I was beginning to feel uneasy,
lest I might miss my guest, when a sweet-faced, dainty look-
ing girl stepped up to me, and after a quick glance said,
"Dr. Seward, is it not?"

"And you are Mrs. Harker!" I answered at once, where-
upon she held out her hand.

"I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy,
but. . ." She stopped suddenly, and a quick blush overspread
her face.

The blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us
both at ease, for it was a tacit answer to her own. I got her
luggage, which included a typewriter, and we took the Under-
ground to Fenchurch Street, after I had sent a wire to my
housekeeper to have a sitting room and a bedroom prepared at
once for Mrs. Harker.

In due time we arrived. She knew, of course, that the
place was a lunatic asylum, but I could see that she was un-
able to repress a shudder when we entered.

She told me that, if she might, she would come presently
to my study, as she had much to say. So here I am finishing
my entry in my phonograph diary whilst I await her. As yet
I have not had the chance of looking at the papers which Van
Helsing left with me, though they lie open before me. I must
get her interested in something, so that I may have an opp-
ortunity of reading them. She does not know how precious
time is, or what a task we have in hand. I must be careful
not to frighten her. Here she is!




MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL

29 September.--After I had tidied myself, I went down
to Dr. Seward's study. At the door I paused a moment, for I
thought I heard him talking with some one. As, however, he
had pressed me to be quick, I knocked at the door, and on his
calling out, "Come in," I entered.

To my intense surprise, there was no one with him. He
was quite alone, and on the table opposite him was what I
knew at once from the description to be a phonograph. I had
never seen one, and was much interested.

"I hope I did not keep you waiting," I said, "but I
stayed at the door as I heard you talking, and thought there
was someone with you."

"Oh," he replied with a smile, "I was only entering my
diary."

"Your diary?" I asked him in surprise.

"Yes," he answered. "I keep it in this." As he spoke
he laid his hand on the phonograph. I felt quite excited
over it, and blurted out, "Why, this beats even shorthand!
May I hear it say something?"

"Certainly," he replied with alacrity, and stood up to
put it in train for speaking. Then he paused, and a troubl-
ed look overspread his face.

"The fact is," he began awkwardly."I only keep my diary
in it, and as it is entirely, almost entirely, about my cases
it may be awkward, that is, I mean. . ." He stopped, and I
tried to help him out of his embarrassment.

"You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end. Let me hear
how she died, for all that I know of her, I shall be very
grateful. She was very, very dear to me."

To my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in
his face, "Tell you of her death? Not for the wide world!"

"Why not?" I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling
was coming over me.

Again he paused, and I could see that he was trying to
invent an excuse. At length, he stammered out, "You see, I
do not know how to pick out any particular part of the
diary."

Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and
he said with unconscious simplicity, in a different voice,
and with the naivete of a child, "that's quite true, upon my
honor. Honest Indian!"

I could not but smile, at which he grimaced."I gave my-
self away that time!" he said. "But do you know that, al-
though I have kept the diary for months past, it never once
struck me how I was going to find any particular part of it
in case I wanted to look it up?"

By this time my mind was made up that the diary of a
doctor who attended Lucy might have something to add to the
sum of our knowledge of that terrible Being, and I said
boldly, "Then, Dr. Seward, you had better let me copy it out
for you on my typewriter."

He grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said, "No!
No! No! For all the world. I wouldn't let you know that
terrible story.!"

Then it was terrible. My intuition was right! For a mo-
ment, I thought, and as my eyes ranged the room, unconscious-
ly looking for something or some opportunity to aid me, they
lit on a great batch of typewriting on the table. His eyes
caught the look in mine, and without his thinking, followed
their direction. As they saw the parcel he realized my mean-
ing.

"You do not know me," I said. "When you have read those
papers, my own diary and my husband's also, which I have
typed, you will know me better. I have not faltered in giv-
ing every thought of my own heart in this cause. But, of
course, you do not know me, yet, and I must not expect you
to trust me so far."

He is certainly a man of noble nature. Poor dear Lucy
was right about him. He stood up and opened a large drawer,
in which were arranged in order a number of hollow cylinders
of metal covered with dark wax, and said,

"You are quite right. I did not trust you because I did
not know you. But I know you now, and let me say that I
should have known you long ago. I know that Lucy told you of
me. She told me of you too. May I make the only atonement
in my power? Take the cylinders and hear them. The first
half-dozen of them are personal to me, and they will not
horrify you. Then you will know me better. Dinner will by
then be ready. In the meantime I shall read over some of
these documents, and shall be better able to understand cer-
tain things."

He carried the phonograph himself up to my sitting room
and adjusted it for me. Now I shall learn something pleasant,
I am sure. For it will tell me the other side of a true love
episode of which I know one side already.




DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


29 September.--I was so absorbed in that wonderful
diary of Jonathan Harker and that other of his wife that I
let the time run on without thinking. Mrs. Harker was not
down when the maid came to announce dinner, so I said, "She
is possibly tired. Let dinner wait an hour," and I went on
with my work. I had just finished Mrs. Harker's diary, when
she came in. She looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and
her eyes were flushed with crying. This somehow moved me
much. Of late I have had cause for tears, God knows! But
the relief of them was denied me, and now the sight of those
sweet eyes, brightened by recent tears, went straight to my
heart. So I said as gently as I could, "I greatly fear I
have distressed you."

"Oh, no, not distressed me," she replied. "But I have
been more touched than I can say by your grief. That is a
wonderful machine, but it is cruelly true. It told me, in
its very tones, the anguish of your heart. It was like a soul
crying out to Almighty God. No one must hear them spoken
ever again! See, I have tried to be useful. I have copied
out the words on my typewriter, and none other need now hear
your heart beat, as I did."

"No one need ever know, shall ever know," I said in a
low voice. She laid her hand on mine and said very gravely,
"Ah, but they must!"

"Must! but why?" I asked.

"Because it is a part of the terrible story, a part of
poor Lucy's death and all that led to it. Because in the
struggle which we have before us to rid the earth of this
terrible monster we must have all the knowledge and all the
help which we can get. I think that the cylinders which you
gave me contained more than you intended me to know. But I
can see that there are in your record many lights to this
dark mystery. You will let me help, will you not? I know all
up to a certain point, and I see already, though your diary
only took me to 7 September, how poor Lucy was beset, and
how her terrible doom was being wrought out. Jonathan and I
have been working day and night since Professor Van Helsing
saw us. He is gone to Whitby to get more information, and
he will be here tomorrow to help us. We need have no secrets
amongst us. Working together and with absolute trust, we
can surely be stronger than if some of us were in the dark."

She looked at me so appealingly, and at the same time
manifested such courage and resolution in her bearing, that
I gave in at once to her wishes. "You shall," I said, "do as
you like in the matter. God forgive me if I do wrong! There
are terrible things yet to learn of. But if you have so far
traveled on the road to poor Lucy's death, you will not be
content, I know, to remain in the dark. Nay, the end, the
very end, may give you a gleam of peace. Come, there is
dinner. We must keep one another strong for what is before
us. We have a cruel and dreadful task. When you have eaten
you shall learn the rest, and I shall answer any questions
you ask, if there be anything which you do not understand,
though it was apparent to us who were present."

MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


29 September.--After dinner I came with Dr. Seward to
his study. He brought back the phonograph from my room, and
I took a chair, and arranged the phonograph so that I could
touch it without getting up, and showed me how to stop it in
case I should want to pause. Then he very thoughtfully took
a chair, with his back to me, so that I might be as free as
possible, and began to read. I put the forked metal to my
ears and listened.

When the terrible story of Lucy's death, and all that
followed, was done, I lay back in my chair powerless. Fort-
unately I am not of a fainting disposition. When Dr. Seward
saw me he jumped up with a horrified exclamation, and hurr-
iedly taking a case bottle from the cupboard, gave me some
brandy, which in a few minutes somewhat restored me. My
brain was all in a whirl, and only that there came through
all the multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my
dear Lucy was at last at peace, I do not think I could have
borne it without making a scene. It is all so wild and mys-
terious, and strange that if I had not known Jonathan's ex-
perience in Transylvania I could not have believed. As it
was, I didn't know what to believe, and so got out of my
difficulty by attending to something else. I took the cover
off my typewriter, and said to Dr. Seward,

"Let me write this all out now. We must be ready for
Dr. Van Helsing when he comes. I have sent a telegram to
Jonathan to come on here when he arrives in London from
Whitby. In this matter dates are everything, and I think
that if we get all of our material ready, and have every item
put in chronological order, we shall have done much.

"You tell me that Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris are
coming too. Let us be able to tell them when they come."

He accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace, and I
began to typewrite from the beginning of the seventeenth cy-
linder. I used manifold, and so took three copies of the
diary, just as I had done with the rest. It was late when I
got through, but Dr. Seward went about his work of going his
round of the patients. When he had finished he came back and
sat near me, reading, so that I did not feel too lonely
whilst I worked. How good and thoughtful he is. The world
seems full of good men, even if there are monsters in it.

Before I left him I remembered what Jonathan put in his
diary of the Professor's perturbation at reading something
in an evening paper at the station at Exeter, so, seeing
that Dr. Seward keeps his newspapers, I borrowed the files
of `The Westminster Gazette' and `The Pall Mall Gazette' and
took them to my room. I remember how much the `Dailygraph'
and `The Whitby Gazette', of which I had made cuttings, had
helped us to understand the terrible events at Whitby when
Count Dracula landed, so I shall look through the evening
papers since then, and perhaps I shall get some new light. I
am not sleepy, and the work will help to keep me quiet.




DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


30 September.--Mr. Harker arrived at nine o'clock. He
got his wife's wire just before starting. He is uncommonly
clever, if one can judge from his face, and full of energy.
If this journal be true, and judging by one's own wonderful
experiences, it must be, he is also a man of great nerve.
That going down to the vault a second time was a remarkable
piece of daring. After reading his account of it I was pre-
pared to meet a good specimen of manhood, but hardly the
quiet, business-like gentleman who came here today.


LATER.--After lunch Harker and his wife went back to
their own room, and as I passed a while ago I heard the click
of the typewriter. They are hard at it. Mrs. Harker says
that knitting together in chronological order every scrap of
evidence they have. Harker has got the letters between the
consignee of the boxes at Whitby and the carriers in London
who took charge of them. He is now reading his wife's tran-
script of my diary. I wonder what they make out of it. Here
it is. . .


Strange that it never struck me that the very next
house might be the Count's hiding place! Goodness knows that
we had enough clues from the conduct of the patient Renfield!
The bundle of letters relating to the purchase of the house
were with the transcript. Oh, if we had only had them earl-
ier we might have saved poor Lucy! Stop! That way madness
lies! Harker has gone back, and is again collecting material.
He says that by dinner time they will be able to show a
whole connected narrative. He thinks that in the meantime I
should see Renfield, as hitherto he has been a sort of index
to the coming and going of the Count. I hardly see this yet,
but when I get at the dates I suppose I shall. What a good
thing that Mrs. Harker put my cylinders into type! We never
could have found the dates otherwise.

I found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his
hands folded, smiling benignly. At the moment he seemed as
sane as any one I ever saw. I sat down and talked with him
on a lot of subjects, all of which he treated naturally. He
then, of his own accord, spoke of going home, a subject he
has never mentioned to my knowledge during his sojourn here.
In fact, he spoke quite confidently of getting his discharge
at once. I believe that, had I not had the chat with Harker
and read the letters and the dates of his outbursts, I should
have been prepared to sign for him after a brief time of ob-
servation. As it is, I am darkly suspicious. All those out-
breaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the
Count. What then does this absolute content mean? Can it be
that his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire's ultimate
triumph? Stay. He is himself zoophagous, and in his wild
ravings outside the chapel door of the deserted house he al-
ways spoke of `master'. This all seems confirmation of our
idea. However, after a while I came away. My friend is just
a little too sane at present to make it safe to probe him
too deep with questions. He might begin to think, and
then. . .So I came away. I mistrust these quiet moods of
of his, so I have given the attendant a hint to look closely
after him, and to have a strait waistcoat ready in case of
need.





JOHNATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


29 September, in train to London.--When I received Mr.
Billington's courteous message that he would give me any in-
formation in his power I thought it best to go down to Whit-
by and make, on the spot, such inquiries as I wanted. It was
now my object to trace that horrid cargo of the Count's to
its place in London. Later, we may be able to deal with it.
Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, and
brought me to his father's house, where they had decided that
I must spend the night. They are hospitable, with true York-
shire hospitality, give a guest everything and leave him
to do as he likes. They all knew that I was busy, and that
my stay was short, and Mr. Billington had ready in his office
all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes. It gave
me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which I had
seen on the Count's table before I knew of his diabolical
plans. Everything had been carefully thought out, and done
systematically and with precision. He seemed to have been
prepared for every obstacle which might be placed by acci-
dent in the way of his intentions being carried out. To use
and Americanism, he had `taken no chances', and the absolute
accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled was
simply the logical result of his care. I saw the invoice, and
took note of it.`Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for
experimental purposes'. Also the copy of the letter to Car-
ter Paterson, and their reply. Of both these I got copies.
This was all the information Mr. Billington could give me, so
I went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customs
Officers and the harbor master, who kindly put me in commun-
ication with the men who had actually received the boxes.
Their tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to
add to the simple description `fifty cases of common earth',
except that the boxes were `main and mortal heavy', and that
shifting them was dry work. One of them added that it was
hard lines that there wasn't any gentleman `such like as
like yourself, squire', to show some sort of appreciation of
their efforts in a liquid form. Another put in a rider that
the thirst then generated was such that even the time which
had elapsed had not completely allayed it. Needless to add,
I took care before leaving to lift, forever and adequately,
this source of reproach.

30 September.--The station master was good enough to
give me a line to his old companion the station master at
King's Cross, so that when I arrived there in the morning I
was able to ask him about the arrival of the boxes. He, too
put me at once in communication with the proper officials,
and I saw that their tally was correct with the original in-
voice. The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had
been here limited. A noble use of them had, however, been
made, and again I was compelled to deal with the result in
ex post facto manner.

From thence I went to Carter Paterson's central office,
where I met with the utmost courtesy. They looked up the
transaction in their day book and letter book, and at once
telephoned to their King's Cross office for more details. By
good fortune, the men who did the teaming were waiting for
work, and the official at once sent them over, sending also
by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected
with the delivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here again I found
the tally agreeing exactly. The carriers' men were able to
supplement the paucity of the written words with a few more
details. These were, I shortly found, connected almost sole-
ly with the dusty nature of the job, and the consequent
thirst engendered in the operators. On my affording an opp-
ortunity, through the medium of the currency of the realm,
of the allaying, at a later period, this beneficial evil,
one of the men remarked,

"That `ere `ouse, guv'nor, is the rummiest I ever was
in. Blyme! But it ain't been touched sence a hundred years.
There was dust that thick in the place that you might have
slep' on it without `urtin' of yer bones. An' the place was
that neglected that yer might `ave smelled ole Jerusalem in
it. But the old chapel, that took the cike, that did! Me and
my mate, we thort we wouldn't never git out quick enough.
Lor', I wouldn't take less nor a quid a moment to stay there
arter dark."

Having been in the house, I could well believe him, but
if he knew what I know, he would, I think have raised his
terms.

Of one thing I am now satisfied. That all those boxes
which arrived at Whitby from Varna in the Demeter were safe-
ly deposited in the old chapel at Carfax. There should be
fifty of them there, unless any have since been removed, as
from Dr. Seward's diary I fear.


Later.--Mina and I have worked all day, and we have put
all the papers into order.




MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


30 September.--I am so glad that I hardly know how to
contain myself. It is, I suppose, the reaction from the
haunting fear which I have had, that this terrible affair and
the reopening of his old wound might act detrimentally on
Jonathan. I saw him leave for Whitby with as brave a face as
could, but I was sick with apprehension. The effort has,
however, done him good. He was never so resolute, never so
strong, never so full of volcanic energy, as at present. It
is just as that dear, good Professor Van Helsing said, he is
true grit, and he improves under strain that would kill a
weaker nature. He came back full of life and hope and deter-
mination. We have got everything in order for tonight. I
feel myself quite wild with excitement. I suppose one ought
to pity anything so hunted as the Count. That is just it.
This thing is not human, not even a beast. To read Dr. Sew-
ard's account of poor Lucy's death, and what followed, is
enough to dry up the springs of pity in one's heart.


Later.--Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier
than we expected. Dr. Seward was out on business, and had
taken Jonathan with him, so I had to see them. It was to me
a painful meeting, for it brought back all poor dear Lucy's
hopes of only a few months ago. Of course they had heard
Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that Dr. Van Helsing, too,
had been quite `blowing my trumpet', as Mr. Morris expressed
it. Poor fellows, neither of them is aware that I know all
about the proposals they made to Lucy. They did not quite
know what to say or do, as they were ignorant of the amount
of my knowledge. So they had to keep on neutral subjects.
However, I thought the matter over, and came to the conclus-
ion that the best thing I could do would be to post them on
affairs right up to date. I knew from Dr. Seward's diary
that they had been at Lucy's death, her real death, and that
I need not fear to betray any secret before the time. So I
told them, as well as I could, that I had read all the papers
and diaries, and that my husband and I, having typewritten
them, had just finished putting them in order. I gave them
each a copy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming got
his and turned it over, it does make a pretty good pile, he
said, "Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?"

I nodded, and he went on.

"I don't quite see the drift of it, but you people are
all so good and kind, and have been working so earnestly and
so energetically, that all I can do is to accept your ideas
blindfold and try to help you. I have had one lesson already
in accepting facts that should make a man humble to the last
hour of his life. Besides, I know you loved my Lucy. . ."

Here he turned away and covered his face with his hands.
I could hear the tears in his voice. Mr. Morris, with in-
stinctive delicacy, just laid a hand for a moment on his
shoulder, and then walked quietly out of the room. I suppose
there is something in a woman's nature that makes a man free
to break down before her and express his feelings on the
tender or emotional side without feeling it derogatory to
his manhood. For when Lord Godalming found himself alone
with me he sat down on the sofa and gave way utterly and op-
enly. I sat down beside him and took his hand. I hope he
didn't think it forward of me, and that if her ever thinks
of it afterwards he never will have such a thought. There I
wrong him. I know he never will. He is too true a gentle-
man. I said to him, for I could see that his heart was break-
ing, "I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and
what you were to her. She and I were like sisters, and now
she is gone, will you not let me be like a sister to you in
your trouble? I know what sorrows you have had, though I
cannot measure the depth of them. If sympathy and pity can
help in your affliction, won't you let me be of some little
service, for Lucy's sake?"

In an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with
grief. It seemed to me that all that he had of late been
suffering in silence found a vent at once. He grew quite hy-
sterical, and raising his open hands, beat his palms together
in a perfect agony of grief. He stood up and then sat down
again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. I felt an in-
finite pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. With
a sob he laid his head on my shoulder and cried like a wear-
ied child, whilst he shook with emotion.

We women have something of the mother in us that makes
us rise above smaller matters when the mother spirit is in-
voked. I felt this big sorrowing man's head resting on me,
as though it were that of a baby that some day may lie on my
bosom, and I stroked his hair as though he were my own child.
I never thought at the time how strange it all was.

After a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised him-
self with an apology, though he made no disguise of his emo-
tion. He told me that for days and nights past, weary days
and sleepless nights, he had been unable to speak with any
one, as a man must speak in his time of sorrow. There was no
woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with whom,
owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was
surrounded, he could speak freely.

"I know now how I suffered," he said, as he dried his
eyes, "but I do not know even yet, and none other can ever
know, how much your sweet sympathy has been to me today. I
shall know better in time, and believe me that, though I am
not ungrateful now, my gratitude will grow with my under-
standing. You will let me be like a brother, will you not,
for all our lives, for dear Lucy's sake?"

"For dear Lucy's sake," I said as we clasped hands."Ay,
and for your own sake," he added, "for if a man's esteem and
gratitude are ever worth the winning, you have won mine to-
day. If ever the future should bring to you a time when you
need a man's help, believe me, you will not call in vain. God
grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the
sunshine of your life, but if it should ever come, promise
me that you will let me know."

He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that I
felt it would comfort him, so I said, "I promise."

As I came along the corridor I say Mr. Morris looking
out of a window. He turned as he heard my footsteps. "How
is Art?" he said. Then noticing my red eyes, he went on, "Ah,
I see you have been comforting him. Poor old fellow! He
needs it. No one but a woman can help a man when he is in
trouble of the heart, and he had no one to comfort him."

He bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled
for him. I saw the manuscript in his hand, and I knew that
when he read it he would realize how much I knew, so I said
to him, "I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart.
Will you let me be your friend, and will you come to me for
comfort if you need it? You will know later why I speak."

He saw that I was in earnest, and stooping, took my hand,
and raising it to his lips, kissed it. It seemed but poor
comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively I
bent over and kissed him. The tears rose in his eyes, and
there was a momentary choking in his throat. He said quite
calmly, "Little girl, you will never forget that true hearted
kindness, so long as ever you live!" Then he went into the
study to his friend.

"Little girl!" The very words he had used to Lucy, and,
oh, but he proved himself a friend.





CHAPTER 18


DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


30 September.--I got home at five o'clock, and found
that Godalming and Morris had not only arrived, but had
already studied the transcript of the various diaries and
letters which Harker had not yet returned from his visit to
the carriers' men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me.
Mrs. Harker gave us a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that,
for the first time since I have lived in it, this old house
seemed like home. When we had finished, Mrs. Harker said,

"Dr. Seward, may I ask a favor? I want to see your pat-
ient, Mr. Renfield. Do let me see him. What you have said
of him in your diary interests me so much!"

She looked so appealing and so pretty that I could not
refuse her, and there was no possible reason why I should, so
I took her with me. When I went into the room, I told the man
that a lady would like to see him, to which he simply answer-
ed, "Why?"

"She is going through the house, and wants to see every
one in it," I answered.

"Oh, very well," he said, "let her come in, by all means,
but just wait a minute till I tidy up the place."

His method of tidying was peculiar, he simply swallowed
all the flies and spiders in the boxes before I could stop
him. It was quite evident that he feared, or was jealous of,
some interference. When he had got through his disgusting
task, he said cheerfully, "Let the lady come in," and sat
down on the edge of his bed with his head down, but with his
eyelids raised so that he could see her as she entered. For
a moment I thought that he might have some homicidal intent.
I remembered how quiet he had been just before he attacked
me in my own study, and I took care to stand where I could
seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her.

She came into the room with an easy gracefulness which
would at once command the respect of any lunatic, for easi-
ness is one of the qualities mad people most respect. She
walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, and held out her hand.

"Good evening, Mr. Renfield," said she. "You see, I
know you, for Dr. Seward has told me of you." He made no
immediate reply, but eyed her all over intently with a set
frown on his face. This look gave way to one of wonder, which
merged in doubt, then to my intense astonishment he said,
"You're not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? You
can't be, you know, for she's dead."

Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied, "Oh no! I
have a husband of my own, to whom I was married before I ever
saw Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs. Harker."

"Then what are you doing here?"

"My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward."

"Then don't stay."

"But why not?"

I thought that this style of conversation might not be
pleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I
joined in, "How did you know I wanted to marry anyone?"

His reply was simply contemptuous, given in a pause in
which he turned his eyes from Mrs. Harker to me, instantly
turning them back again, "What an asinine question!"

"I don't see that at all, Mr. Renfield," said Mrs. Harker,
at once championing me.

He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as
he had shown contempt to me, "You will, of course, under-
stand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is so loved and honored
as our host is, everything regarding him is of interest in
our little community. Dr. Seward is loved not only by his
household and his friends, but even by his patients, who, be-
ing some of them hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to
distort causes and effects. Since I myself have been an in-
mate of a lunatic asylum, I cannot but notice that the soph-
istic tendencies of some of its inmates lean towards the
errors of non causa and ignoratio elenche."

I positively opened my eyes at this new development.
Here was my own pet lunatic, the most pronounced of his type
that I had ever met with, talking elemental philosophy, and
with the manner of a polished gentleman. I wonder if it was
Mrs. Harker's presence which had touched some chord in his
memory. If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any way due
to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift
or power.

We continued to talk for some time, and seeing that he
was seemingly quite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me
questioningly as she began, to lead him to his favorite topic.
I was again astonished, for he addressed himself to the ques-
tion with the impartiality of the completest sanity. He even
took himself as an example when he mentioned certain things.

"Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange
belief. Indeed, it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed,
and insisted on my being put under control. I used to fancy
that life was a positive and perpetual entity, and that by
consuming a multitude of live things, no matter how low in
the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong life.
At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried
to take human life. The doctor here will bear me out that
on one occasion I tried to kill him for the purpose of
strengthening my vital powers by the assimilation with my
own body of his life through the medium of his blood, relying
of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, `For the blood is the
life.' Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has
vulgarized the truism to the very point of contempt. Isn't
that true, doctor?"

I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew
what to either think or say, it was hard to imagine that I
had seen him eat up his spiders and flies not five minutes
before. Looking at my watch, I saw that I should go to the
station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs. Harker that it
was time to leave.

She came at once, after saying pleasantly to Mr. Renfield,
"Goodbye, and I hope I may see you often, under auspices plea-
santer to yourself."

To which, to my astonishment, he replied, "Goodbye, my
dear. I pray God I may never see your sweet face again. May
He bless and keep you!"

When I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left
the boys behind me. Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has
been since Lucy first took ill, and Quincey is more like his
own bright self than he has been for many a long day.

Van Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager
nimbleness of a boy. He saw me at once, and rushed up to me,
saying, "Ah, friend John, how goes all? Well? So! I have
been busy, for I come here to stay if need be.  All affairs are
settled with me, and I have much to tell. Madam Mina is with
you? Yes. And her so fine husband? And Arthur and my friend
Quincey, they are with you, too? Good!"

As I drove to the house I told him of what had passed,
and of how my own diary had come to be of some use through
Mrs. Harker's suggestion, at which the Professor interrupted
me.

"Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina! She has man's brain, a
brain that a man should have were he much gifted, and a wo-
man's heart. The good God fashioned her for a purpose, believe
me, when He made that so good combination. Friend John, up to
now fortune has made that woman of help to us, after tonight
she must not have to do with this so terrible affair. It is
not good that she run a risk so great. We men are determined,
nay, are we not pledged, to destroy this monster? But it is
no part for a woman. Even if she be not harmed, her heart may
fail her in so much and so many horrors and hereafter she
may suffer, both in waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from
her dreams. And, besides, she is young woman and not so
long married, there may be other things to think of some
time, if not now. You tell me she has wrote all, then she must
consult with us, but tomorrow she say goodbye to this work,
and we go alone."

I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we
had found in his absence, that the house which Dracula had
bought was the very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a
great concern seemed to come on him.

"Oh that we had known it before!" he said, "for then we
might have reached him in time to save poor Lucy. However,
`the milk that is spilt cries not out afterwards,'as you say.
We shall not think of that, but go on our way to the end."
Then he fell into a silence that lasted till we entered my
own gateway. Before we went to prepare for dinner he said
to Mrs. Harker, "I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John
that you and your husband have put up in exact order all
things that have been, up to this moment."

"Not up to this moment, Professor," she said impulsively,
"but up to this morning."

"But why not up to now? We have seen hitherto how good
light all the little things have made. We have told our se-
crets, and yet no one who has told is the worse for it."

Mrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her
pockets, she said, "Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this,
and tell me if it must go in. It is my record of today. I
too have seen the need of putting down at present everything,
however trivial, but there is little in this except what is
personal. Must it go in?"

The Professor read it over gravely, and handed it back,
saying, "It need not go in if you do not wish it, but I pray
that it may. It can but make your husband love you the more,
and all us, your friends, more honor you, as well as more
esteem and love." She took it back with another blush and a
bright smile.

And so now, up to this very hour, all the records we
have are complete and in order. The Professor took away one
copy to study after dinner, and before our meeting, which is
fixed for nine o'clock. The rest of us have already read
everything, so when we meet in the study we shall all be in-
formed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with
this terrible and mysterious enemy.





MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


30 September.--When we met in Dr. Seward's study two
hours after dinner, which had been at six o'clock, we un-
consciously formed a sort of board or committee. Professor
Van Helsing took the head of the table, to which Dr. Seward
motioned him as he came into the room. He made me sit next
to him on his right, and asked me to act as secretary. Jon-
athan sat next to me. Opposite us were Lord Godalming, Dr.
Seward, and Mr. Morris, Lord Godalming being next the Pro-
fessor, and Dr. Seward in the center.

The Professor said, "I may, I suppose, take it that we
are all acquainted with the facts that are in these papers."
We all expressed assent, and he went on, "Then it were, I
think, good that I tell you something of the kind of enemy
with which we have to deal. I shall then make known to you
something of the history of this man, which has been as-
certained for me. So we then can discuss how we shall act,
and can take our measure according.

"There are such beings as vampires, some of us have ev-
idence that they exist. Even had we not the proof of our
own unhappy experience, the teachings and the records of the
past give proof enough for sane peoples. I admit that at the
first I was sceptic. Were it not that through long years I
have trained myself to keep an open mind, I could not have
believed until such time as that fact thunder on my ear.`See!
See! I prove, I prove.' Alas! Had I known at first what now
I know, nay, had I even guess at him, one so precious life
had been spared to many of us who did love her. But that is
gone, and we must so work, that other poor souls perish not,
whilst we can save. The nosferatu do not die like the bee
when he sting once. He is only stronger, and being stronger,
have yet more power to work evil. This vampire which is
amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men,
he is of cunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the
growth of ages, he have still the aids of necromancy, which
is, as his etymology imply, the divination by the dead, and
all the dead that he can come nigh to are for him at command,
he is brute, and more than brute, he is devil in callous, and
the heart of him is not, he can, within his range, direct the
elements, the storm, the fog, the thunder, he can command all
the meaner things, the rat, and the owl, and the bat, the
moth, and the fox, and the wolf, he can grow and become small,
and he can at times vanish and come unknown. How then are we
to begin our strike to destroy him? How shall we find his
where, and having found it, how can we destroy? My friends,
this is much, it is a terrible task that we undertake, and
there may be consequence to make the brave shudder. For if
we fail in this our fight he must surely win, and then where
end we? Life is nothings, I heed him not. But to fail here,
is not mere life or death. It is that we become as him, that
we henceforward become foul things of the night like him,
without heart or conscience, preying on the bodies and the
souls of those we love best. To us forever are the gates of
heaven shut, for who shall open them to us again? We go on
for all time abhorred by all, a blot on the face of God's
sunshine, an arrow in the side of Him who died for man. But
we are face to face with duty, and in such case must we
shrink? For me, I say no, but then I am old, and life, with
his sunshine, his fair places, his song of birds, his music
and his love, lie far behind. You others are young. Some
have seen sorrow, but there are fair days yet in store. What
say you?"

Whilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand. I
feared, oh so much, that the appalling nature of our danger
was overcoming him when I saw his hand stretch out, but it
was life to me to feel its touch, so strong, so self reliant,
so resolute.  A brave man's hand can speak for itself, it does
not even need a woman's love to hear its music.

When the Professor had done speaking my husband looked
in my eyes, and I in his, there was no need for speaking
between us.

"I answer for Mina and myself," he said.

"Count me in, Professor," said Mr. Quincey Morris,
laconically as usual.

"I am with you," said Lord Godalming, "for Lucy's sake,
if for no other reason."

Dr. Seward simply nodded.

The Professor stood up and, after laying his golden cru-
cifix on the table, held out his hand on either side. I took
his right hand, and Lord Godalming his left, Jonathan held
my right with his left and stretched across to Mr. Morris. So
as we all took hands our solemn compact was made. I felt my
heart icy cold, but it did not even occur to me to draw back.
We resumed our places, and Dr. Van Helsing went on with a
sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work had
begun. It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike
a way, as any other transaction of life.

"Well, you know what we have to contend against, but we
too, are not without strength. We have on our side power of
combination, a power denied to the vampire kind, we have
sources of science, we are free to act and think, and the
hours of the day and the night are ours equally. In fact, so
far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we are
free to use them. We have self devotion in a cause and an end
to achieve which is not a selfish one. These things are much.

"Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed ag-
ainst us are restrict, and how the individual cannot. In fine,
let us consider the limitations of the vampire in general,
and of this one in particular.

"All we have to go upon are traditions and supersti-
tions. These do not at the first appear much, when the matter
is one of life and death, nay of more than either life or
death. Yet must we be satisfied, in the first place because we
have to be, no other means is at our control, and secondly,
because, after all these things, tradition and superstition,
are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest for
others, though not, alas! for us, on them! A year ago which
of us would have received such a possibility, in the midst of
our scientific, sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century?
We even scouted a belief that we saw justified under our
very eyes. Take it, then, that the vampire, and the belief
in his limitations and his cure, rest for the moment on the
same base. For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere that
men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome, he flourish in
Germany all over, in France, in India, even in the Chermosese,
and in China, so far from us in all ways, there even is he,
and the peoples for him at this day. He have follow the wake
of the berserker Icelander, the devil-begotten Hun, the Slav,
the Saxon, the Magyar.

"So far, then, we have all we may act upon, and let me
tell you that very much of the beliefs are justified by what
we have seen in our own so unhappy experience. The vampire
live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the time, he can
flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the living.
Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow
younger, that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as
though they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is
plenty.

"But he cannot flourish without this diet, he eat not
as others. Even friend Jonathan, who lived with him for
weeks, did never see him eat, never! He throws no shadow,
he make in the mirror no reflect, as again Jonathan observe.
He has the strength of many of his hand, witness again Jona-
than when he shut the door against the wolves, and when he
help him from the diligence too. He can transform himself to
wolf, as we gather from the ship arrival in Whitby, when he
tear open the dog, he can be as bat, as Madam Mina saw him on
the window at Whitby, and as friend John saw him fly from
this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him at the
window of Miss Lucy.

"He can come in mist which he create, that noble ship's
captain proved him of this, but, from what we know, the dis-
tance he can make this mist is limited, and it can only be
round himself.

"He come on moonlight rays as elemental dust, as again
Jonathan saw those sisters in the castle of Dracula. He be-
come so small, we ourselves saw Miss Lucy, ere she was at
peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the tomb door. He
can, when once he find his way, come out from anything or
into anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused
up with fire, solder you call it. He can see in the dark, no
small power this, in a world which is one half shut from the
light. Ah, but hear me through.

"He can do all these things, yet he is not free. Nay,
he is even more prisoner than the slave of the galley, than
the madman in his cell. He cannot go where he lists, he who
is not of nature has yet to obey some of nature's laws, why
we know not. He may not enter anywhere at the first, unless
there be some one of the household who bid him to come,
though afterwards he can come as he please. His power ceases,
as does that of all evil things, at the coming of the day.

"Only at certain times can he have limited freedom. If
he be not at the place whither he is bound, he can only
change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset. These
things we are told, and in this record of ours we have proof
by inference. Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his
limit, when he have his earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-
home, the place unhallowed, as we saw when he went to the
grave of the suicide at Whitby, still at other time he can
only change when the time come. It is said, too, that he can
only pass running water at the slack or the flood of the
tide. Then there are things which so afflict him that he has
no power, as the garlic that we know of, and as for things
sacred, as this symbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even
now when we resolve, to them he is nothing, but in their
presence he take his place far off and silent with respect.
There are others, too, which I shall tell you of, lest in our
seeking we may need them.

"The branch of wild rose on his coffin keep him that he
move not from it, a sacred bullet fired into the coffin kill
him so that he be true dead, and as for the stake through
him, we know already of its peace, or the cut off head that
giveth rest. We have seen it with our eyes.

"Thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was,
we can confine him to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey
what we know. But he is clever. I have asked my friend
Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to make his record, and
from all the means that are, he tell me of what he has been.
He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his
name against the Turk, over the great river on the very
frontier of Turkey-land. If it be so, then was he no common
man, for in that time, and for centuries after, he was spoken
of as the cleverest and the most cunning, as well as the
bravest of the sons of the `land beyond the forest.' That
mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his
grave, and are even now arrayed against us. The Draculas
were, says Arminius, a great and noble race, though now and
again were scions who were held by their coevals to have had
dealings with the Evil One. They learned his secrets in the
Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake Hermanstadt,
where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due. In the
records are such words as `stregoica' witch, `ordog' and
`pokol' Satan and hell, and in one manuscript this very
Dracula is spoken of as `wampyr,'which we all understand too
well. There have been from the loins of this very one great
men and good women, and their graves make sacred the earth
where alone this foulness can dwell. For it is not the least
of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in all
good, in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest."

Whilst they were talking Mr. Morris was looking steadily
at the window, and he now got up quietly, and went out of the
room. There was a little pause, and then the Professor went
on.

"And now we must settle what we do. We have here much
data, and we must proceed to lay out our campaign. We know
from the inquiry of Jonathan that from the castle to Whitby
came fifty boxes of earth, all of which were delivered at
Carfax, we also know that at least some of these boxes have
been removed. It seems to me, that our first step should be
to ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond
that wall where we look today, or whether any more have been
removed. If the latter, we must trace. . ."

Here we were interrupted in a very startling way. Out-
side the house came the sound of a pistol shot, the glass of
the window was shattered with a bullet, which ricochetting
from the top of the embrasure, struck the far wall of the
room. I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shrieked
out. The men all jumped to their feet, Lord Godalming flew
over to the window and threw up the sash. As he did so we
heard Mr. Morris' voice without, "Sorry! I fear I have
alarmed you. I shall come in and tell you about it."

A minute later he came in and said, "It was an idiotic
thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs. Harker, most
sincerely, I fear I must have frightened you terribly. But
the fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came
a big bat and sat on the window sill. I have got such a
horror of the damned brutes from recent events that I cannot
stand them, and I went out to have a shot, as I have been
doing of late of evenings, whenever I have seen one. You
used to laugh at me for it then, Art."

"Did you hit it?" asked Dr. Van Helsing.

"I don't know, I fancy not, for it flew away into the
wood." Without saying any more he took his seat, and the
Professor began to resume his statement.

"We must trace each of these boxes, and when we are
ready, we must either capture or kill this monster in his
lair, or we must, so to speak, sterilize the earth, so that
no more he can seek safety in it. Thus in the end we may find
him in his form of man between the hours of noon and sunset,
and so engage with him when he is at his most weak.

"And now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the end until
all be well. You are too precious to us to have such risk.
When we part tonight, you no more must question. We shall
tell you all in good time. We are men and are able to bear,
but you must be our star and our hope, and we shall act all
the more free that you are not in the danger, such as we are."

All the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved, but it did
not seem to me good that they should brave danger and, per-
haps lessen their safety, strength being the best safety,
through care of me, but their minds were made up, and though
it was a bitter pill for me to swallow, I could say nothing,
save to accept their chivalrous care of me.

Mr. Morris resumed the discussion, "As there is no time
to lose, I vote we have a look at his house right now. Time
is everything with him, and swift action on our part may save
another victim."

I own that my heart began to fail me when the time for
action came so close, but I did not say anything, for I had
a greater fear that if I appeared as a drag or a hindrance
to their work, they might even leave me out of their counsels
altogether. They have now gone off to Carfax, with means to
get into the house.

Manlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep, as if
a woman can sleep when those she loves are in danger! I shall
lie down, and pretend to sleep, lest Jonathan have added
anxiety about me when he returns.




DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


1 October, 4 A.M.--Just as we were about to leave the
house, an urgent message was brought to me from Renfield to
know if I would see him at once, as he had something of the
utmost importance to say to me. I told the messenger to say
that I would attend to his wishes in the morning, I was busy
just at the moment.

The attendant added, "He seems very importunate, sir.
I have never seen him so eager. I don't know but what, if you
don't see him soon, he will have one of his violent fits." I
knew the man would not have said this without some cause, so
I said, "All right, I'll go now," and I asked the others to
wait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my patient.

"Take me with you, friend John," said the Professor."His
case in your diary interest me much, and it had bearing, too,
now and again on our case. I should much like to see him,
and especial when his mind is disturbed."

"May I come also?" asked Lord Godalming.

"Me too?" said Quincey Morris. "May I come?" said
Harker. I nodded, and we all went down the passage together.

We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but
far more rational in his speech and manner than I had ever
seen him. There was an unusual understanding of himself,
which was unlike anything I had ever met with in a lunatic,
and he took it for granted that his reasons would prevail
with others entirely sane. We all five went into the room,
but none of the others at first said anything. His request
was that I would at once release him from the asylum and
send him home. This he backed up with arguments regarding his
complete recovery, and adduced his own existing sanity.

"I appeal to your friends, "he said, "they will, perhaps,
not mind sitting in judgement on my case. By the way, you
have not introduced me."

I was so much astonished, that the oddness of introduc-
ing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment,
and besides, there was a certain dignity in the man's manner,
so much of the habit of equality, that I at once made the
introduction, "Lord Godalming, Professor Van Helsing, Mr.
Quincey Morris, of Texas, Mr. Jonathan Harker, Mr. Renfield."

He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn, "Lord
Godalming, I had the honor of seconding your father at the
Windham, I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that
he is no more. He was a man loved and honored by all who
knew him, and in his youth was, I have heard, the inventor
of a burnt rum punch, much patronized on Derby night. Mr.
Morris, you should be proud of your great state. Its recep-
tion into the Union was a precedent which may have far-
reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics
may hold alliance to the Stars and Stripes. The power of
Treaty may yet prove a vast engine of enlargement, when the
Monroe doctrine takes its true place as a political fable.
What shall any man say of his pleasure at meeting Van Hel-
sing? Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of
conventional prefix. When an individual has revolutionized
therapeutics by his discovery of the continuous evolution of
brain matter, conventional forms are unfitting, since they
would seem to limit him to one of a class. You, gentlemen,
who by nationality, by heredity, or by the possession of
natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective places in
the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at
least the majority of men who are in full possession of
their liberties. And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, human-
itarian and medico-jurist as well as scientist, will deem it
a moral duty to deal with me as one to be considered as un-
der exceptional circumstances."He made this last appeal with
a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own
charm.

I think we were all staggered. For my own part, I was
under the conviction, despite my knowledge of the man's
character and history, that his reason had been restored, and
I felt under a strong impulse to tell him that I was satis-
fied as to his sanity, and would see about the necessary
formalities for his release in the morning. I thought it
better to wait, however, before making so grave a statement,
for of old I knew the sudden changes to which this parti-
cular patient was liable. So I contented myself with making
a general statement that he appeared to be improving very
rapidly, that I would have a longer chat with him in the
morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction
of meeting his wishes.

This did not at all satisfy him, for he said quickly,
"But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish.
I desire to go at once, here, now, this very hour, this very
moment, if I may. Time presses, and in our implied agree-
ment with the old scytheman it is of the essence of the con-
tract. I am sure it is only necessary to put before so
admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet so
momentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment."

He looked at me keenly, and seeing the negative in my
face, turned to the others, and scrutinized them closely. Not
meeting any sufficient response, he went on, "Is it possible
that I have erred in my supposition?"

"You have," I said frankly, but at the same time, as I
felt, brutally.

There was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly,
"Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request. Let
me ask for this concession, boon, privilege, what you will.
I am content to implore in such a case, not on personal
grounds, but for the sake of others. I am not at liberty to
give you the whole of my reasons, but you may, I assure you,
take it from me that they are good ones, sound and unselfish,
and spring from the highest sense of duty.

"Could you look, sir, into my heart, you would approve
to the full the sentiments which animate me. Nay, more, you
would count me amongst the best and truest of your friends."

Again he looked at us all keenly. I had a growing con-
viction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual
method was but yet another phase of his madness, and so
determined to let him go on a little longer, knowing from
experience that he would, like all lunatics, give himself
away in the end. Van Helsing was gazing at him with a look
of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meeting with
the fixed concentration of his look. He said to Renfield in
a tone which did not surprise me at the time, but only when
I thought of it afterwards, for it was as of one addressing
an equal, "Can you not tell frankly your real reason for
wishing to be free tonight? I will undertake that if you
will satisfy even me, a stranger, without prejudice, and
with the habit of keeping an open mind, Dr. Seward will give
you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, the
privilege you seek."

He shook his head sadly, and with a look of poignant
regret on his face. The Professor went on, "Come, sir,
bethink yourself. You claim the privilege of reason in the
highest degree, since you seek to impress us with your com-
plete reasonableness. You do this, whose sanity we have
reason to doubt, since you are not yet released from medical
treatment for this very defect. If you will not help us in
our effort to choose the wisest course, how can we perform
the duty which you yourself put upon us? Be wise, and help
us, and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish."

He still shook his head as he said, "Dr. Van Helsing,
I have nothing to say. Your argument is complete, and if I
were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment, but I am
not my own master in the matter. I can only ask you to trust
me. If I am refused, the responsibility does not rest with
me."

I thought it was now time to end the scene, which was
becoming too comically grave, so I went towards the door,
simply saying, "Come, my friends, we have work to do.
Goodnight."

As, however, I got near the door, a new change came
over the patient. He moved towards me so quickly that for
the moment I feared that he was about to make another homi-
cidal attack. My fears, however, were groundless, for he
held up his two hands imploringly, and made his petition in
a moving manner. As he saw that the very excess of his
emotion was militating against him, by restoring us more
to our old relations, he became still more demonstrative. I
glanced at Van Helsing, and saw my conviction reflected in
his eyes, so I became a little more fixed in my manner, if
not more stern, and motioned to him that his efforts were
unavailing. I had previously seen something of the same con-
stantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some
request of which at the time he had thought much, such for
instance, as when he wanted a cat, and I was prepared to see
the collapse into the same sullen acquiescence on this
occasion.

My expectation was not realized, for when he found that
his appeal would not be successful, he got into quite a fran-
tic condition. He threw himself on his knees, and held up his
hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured
forth a torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his
cheeks, and his whole face and form expressive of the deepest
emotion.

"Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you,
to let me out of this house at once. Send me away how you
will and where you will, send keepers with me with whips and
chains, let them take me in a strait waistcoat, manacled and
leg-ironed, even to gaol, but let me go out of this. You don't
know what you do by keeping me here. I am speaking from the
depths of my heart, of my very soul. You don't know whom you
wrong, or how, and I may not tell. Woe is me! I may not tell.
By all you hold sacred, by all you hold dear, by your love
that is lost, by your hope that lives, for the sake of the
Almighty, take me out of this and save my soul from guilt!
Can't you hear me, man? Can't you understand? Will you never
learn? Don't you know that I am sane and earnest now, that I
am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting for his
soul? Oh, hear me! Hear me! Let me go, let me go, let me
go!"

I thought that the longer this went on the wilder he
would get, and so would bring on a fit, so I took him by the
hand and raised him up.

"Come," I said sternly, "no more of this, we have had
quite enough already. Get to your bed and try to behave more
discreetly."

He suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for sev-
eral moments. Then, without a word, he rose and moving over,
sat down on the side of the bed. The collapse had come, as
on former occasions, just as I had expected.

When I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said
to me in a quiet, well-bred voice, "You will, I trust, Dr.
Seward, do me the justice to bear in mind, later on, that I
did what I could to convince you tonight."





CHAPTER 19


JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


1 October, 5 A.M.--I went with the party to the search
with an easy mind, for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely
strong and well. I am so glad that she consented to hold
back and let us men do the work. Somehow, it was a dread to
me that she was in this fearful business at all, but now
that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy and
brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in
such a way that every point tells, she may well feel that
her part is finished, and that she can henceforth leave the
rest to us. We were, I think, all a little upset by the
scene with Mr. Renfield. When we came away from his room we
were silent till we got back to the study.

Then Mr. Morris said to Dr. Seward, "Say, Jack, if that
man wasn't attempting a bluff, he is about the sanest lunatic
I ever saw. I'm not sure, but I believe that he had some
serious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him
not to get a chance."

Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing
added, "Friend John, you know more lunatics than I do, and
I'm glad of it, for I fear that if it had been to me to de-
cide I would before that last hysterical outburst have given
him free. But we live and learn, and in our present task we
must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say. All is
best as they are."

Dr. Seward seemed to answer them both in a dreamy kind
of way, "I don't know but that I agree with you. If that
man had been an ordinary lunatic I would have taken my
chance of trusting him, but he seems so mixed up with the
Count in an indexy kind of way that I am afraid of doing any-
thing wrong by helping his fads. I can't forget how he prayed
with almost equal fervor for a cat, and then tried to tear my
throat out with his teeth.  Besides, he called the Count `lord
and master', and he may want to get out to help him in some
diabolical way. That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats
and his own kind to help him, so I suppose he isn't above
trying to use a respectable lunatic. He certainly did seem
earnest, though. I only hope we have done what is best.
These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in
hand, help to unnerve a man."

The Professor stepped over, and laying his hand on his
shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way, "Friend John, have
no fear. We are trying to do our duty in a very sad and
terrible case, we can only do as we deem best. What else
have we to hope for, except the pity of the good God?"

Lord Godalming had slipped away for a few minutes, but
now he returned. He held up a little silver whistle, as he
remarked, "That old place may be full of rats, and if so,
I've got an antidote on call."

Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house,
taking care to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn
when the moonlight shone out. When we got to the porch the
Professor opened his bag and took out a lot of things, which
he laid on the step, sorting them into four little groups,
evidently one for each. Then he spoke.

"My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we
need arms of many kinds. Our enemy is not merely spiritual.
Remember that he has the strength of twenty men, and that,
though our necks or our windpipes are of the common kind, and
therefore breakable or crushable, his are not amenable to
mere strength. A stronger man, or a body of men more strong
in all than him, can at certain times hold him, but they can-
not hurt him as we can be hurt by him. We must, therefore,
guard ourselves from his touch. Keep this near your heart."
As he spoke he lifted a little silver crucifix and held it
out to me, I being nearest to him, "put these flowers round
your neck," here he handed to me a wreath of withered garlic
blossoms, "for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and
this knife, and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps,
which you can fasten to your breast, and for all, and above
all at the last, this, which we must not desecrate needless."

This was a portion of Sacred Wafer, which he put in an
envelope and handed to me. Each of the others was similarly
equipped.

"Now," he said, "friend John, where are the skeleton keys?
If so that we can open the door, we need not break house by
the window, as before at Miss Lucy's."

Dr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechani-
cal dexterity as a surgeon standing him in good stead. Pre-
sently he got one to suit, after a little play back and
forward the bolt yielded, and with a rusty clang, shot back.
We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and it
slowly opened. It was startlingly like the image conveyed to
me in Dr. Seward's diary of the opening of Miss Westenra's
tomb, I fancy that the same idea seemed to strike the others,
for with one accord they shrank back. The Professor was the
first to move forward, and stepped into the open door.

"In manus tuas, Domine!"he said, crossing himself as he
passed over the threshold. We closed the door behind us, lest
when we should have lit our lamps we should possibly attract
attention from the road. The Professor carefully tried the
lock, lest we might not be able to open it from within
should we be in a hurry making our exit. Then we all lit our
lamps and proceeded on our search.

The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd
forms, as the rays crossed each other, or the opacity of our
bodies threw great shadows. I could not for my life get away
from the feeling that there was someone else amongst us. I
suppose it was the recollection, so powerfully brought home
to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible experience
in Transylvania. I think the feeling was common to us all,
for I noticed that the others kept looking over their
shoulders at every sound and every new shadow, just as I felt
myself doing.

The whole place was thick with dust. The floor was seem-
ingly inches deep, except where there were recent footsteps,
in which on holding down my lamp I could see marks of hob-
nails where the dust was cracked. The walls were fluffy and
heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of spider's
webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old
tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down. On a
table in the hall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-
yellowed label on each. They had been used several times, for
on the table were several similar rents in the blanket of
dust, similar to that exposed when the Professor lifted them.

He turned to me and said, "You know this place, Jonathan.
You have copied maps of it, and you know it at least more
than we do. Which is the way to the chapel?"

I had an idea of its direction, though on my former
visit I had not been able to get admission to it, so I led
the way, and after a few wrong turnings found myself opposite
a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands.

"This is the spot," said the Professor as he turned his
lamp on a small map of the house, copied from the file of my
original correspondence regarding the purchase. With a
little trouble we found the key on the bunch and opened the
door. We were prepared for some unpleasantness, for as we
were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to ex-
hale through the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an
odor as we encountered. None of the others had met the
Count at all at close quarters, and when I had seen him he
was either in the fasting stage of his existence in his
rooms or, when he was bloated with fresh blood, in a ruined
building open to the air, but here the place was small and
close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul.
There was an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came
through the fouler air. But as to the odor itself, how shall
I describe it? It was not alone that it was composed of all
the ills of mortality and with the pungent, acrid smell of
blood, but it seemed as though corruption had become itself
corrupt. Faugh! It sickens me to think of it. Every breath
exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place
and intensified its loathsomeness.

Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have
brought our enterprise to an end, but this was no ordinary
case, and the high and terrible purpose in which we were in-
volved gave us a strength which rose above merely physical
considerations. After the involuntary shrinking consequent
on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our
work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.

We made an accurate examination of the place, the Pro-
fessor saying as we began, "The first thing is to see how
many of the boxes are left, we must then examine every hole
and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some clue as
to what has become of the rest."

A glance was sufficient to show how many remained, for
the great earth chests were bulky, and there was no mistaking
them.

There were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! Once
I got a fright, for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and
look out of the vaulted door into the dark passage beyond, I
looked too, and for an instant my heart stood still. Some-
where, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to see the high
lights of the Count's evil face, the ridge of the nose, the
red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor. It was only for a
moment, for, as Lord Godalming said, "I thought I saw a face,
but it was only the shadows," and resumed his inquiry, I
turned my lamp in the direction, and stepped into the passage.
There was no sign of anyone, and as there were no corners, no
doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid walls of
the passage, there could be no hiding place even for him. I
took it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.

A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back
from a corner, which he was examining. We all followed his
movements with our eyes, for undoubtedly some nervousness was
growing on us, and we saw a whole mass of phosphorescence,
which twinkled like stars. We all instinctively drew back.
The whole place was becoming alive with rats.

For a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord
Godalming, who was seemingly prepared for such an emergency.
Rushing over to the great iron-bound oaken door, which Dr.
Seward had described from the outside, and which I had seen
myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew the huge bolts,
and swung the door open. Then, taking his little silver
whistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call. It was
answered from behind Dr. Seward's house by the yelping of
dogs, and after about a minute three terriers came dashing
round the corner of the house. Unconsciously we had all
moved towards the door, and as we moved I noticed that the
dust had been much disturbed. The boxes which had been taken
out had been brought this way. But even in the minute that
had elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. They
seemed to swarm over the place all at once, till the lamp-
light, shining on their moving dark bodies and glittering,
baleful eyes, made the place look like a bank of earth set
with fireflies. The dogs dashed on, but at the threshold
suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting
their noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. The
rats were multiplying in thousands, and we moved out.

Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him
in, placed him on the floor. The instant his feet touched the
ground he seemed to recover his courage, and rushed at his
natural enemies. They fled before him so fast that before he
had shaken the life out of a score, the other dogs, who had
by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey
ere the whole mass had vanished.

With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had
departed, for the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as
they made sudden darts at their prostrate foes, and turned
them over and over and tossed them in the air with vicious
shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise. Whether it
was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of
the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by
finding ourselves in the open I know not, but most certainly
the shadow of dread seemed to slip from us like a robe, and
the occasion of our coming lost something of its grim signi-
ficance, though we did not slacken a whit in our resolution.
We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and bring-
ing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We
found nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary pro-
portions, and all untouched save for my own footsteps when I
had made my first visit. Never once did the dogs exhibit
any symptom of uneasiness, and even when we returned to the
chapel they frisked about as though they had been rabbit
hunting in a summer wood.

The morning was quickening in the east when we emerged
from the front. Dr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the
hall door from the bunch, and locked the door in orthodox
fashion, putting the key into his pocket when he had done.

"So far," he said, "our night has been eminently suc-
cessful. No harm has come to us such as I feared might be
and yet we have ascertained how many boxes are missing. More
than all do I rejoice that this, our first, and perhaps our
most difficult and dangerous, step has been accomplished
without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or
troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and
sounds and smells of horror which she might never forget. One
lesson, too, we have learned, if it be allowable to argue a
particulari, that the brute beasts which are to the Count's
command are yet themselves not amenable to his spiritual
power, for look, these rats that would come to his call, just
as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going
and to that poor mother's cry, though they come to him, they
run pell-mell from the so little dogs of my friend Arthur. We
have other matters before us, other dangers, other fears, and
that monster. . .He has not used his power over the brute
world for the only or the last time tonight. So be it that
he has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us opportunity to
cry `check'in some ways in this chess game, which we play for
the stake of human souls. And now let us go home. The dawn
is close at hand, and we have reason to be content with our
first night's work. It may be ordained that we have many
nights and days to follow, if full of peril, but we must go
on, and from no danger shall we shrink."

The house was silent when we got back, save for some
poor creature who was screaming away in one of the distant
wards, and a low, moaning sound from Renfield's room. The
poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself, after the manner
of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain.

I came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep,
breathing so softly that I had to put my ear down to hear
it. She looks paler than usual. I hope the meeting tonight
has not upset her. I am truly thankful that she is to be
left out of our future work, and even of our deliberations.
It is too great a strain for a woman to bear. I did not think
so at first, but I know better now. Therefore I am glad that
it is settled. There may be things which would frighten her
to hear, and yet to conceal them from her might be worse
than to tell her if once she suspected that there was any
concealment. Henceforth our work is to be a sealed book to
her, till at least such time as we can tell her that all is
finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether
world. I daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep sil-
ence after such confidence as ours, but I must be resolute,
and tomorrow I shall keep dark over tonight's doings, and
shall refuse to speak of anything that has happened. I rest
on the sofa, so as not to disturb her.


1 October, later.--I suppose it was natural that we
should have all overslept ourselves, for the day was a busy
one, and the night had no rest at all. Even Mina must have
felt its exhaustion, for though I slept till the sun was high,
I was awake before her, and had to call two or three times
before she awoke. Indeed, she was so sound asleep that for
a few seconds she did not recognize me, but looked at me
with a sort of blank terror, as one looks who has been waked
out of a bad dream. She complained a little of being tired,
and I let her rest till later in the day. We now know of
twenty-one boxes having been removed, and if it be that
several were taken in any of these removals we may be able
to trace them all. Such will, of course, immensely simplify
our labor, and the sooner the matter is attended to the
better. I shall look up Thomas Snelling today.

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


1 October.--It was towards noon when I was awakened by
the Professor walking into my room. He was more jolly and
cheerful than usual, and it is quite evident that last
night's work has helped to take some of the brooding weight
off his mind.

After going over the adventure of the night he suddenly
said, "Your patient interests me much. May it be that with
you I visit him this morning? Or if that you are too occupy,
I can go alone if it may be. It is a new experience to me to
find a lunatic who talk philosophy, and reason so sound."

I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him that
if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not
have to keep him waiting, so I called an attendant and gave
him the necessary instructions. Before the Professor left
the room I cautioned him against getting any false impress-
ion from my patient.

"But," he answered, "I want him to talk of himself and
of his delusion as to consuming live things. He said to
Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of yesterday, that he had
once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend John?"

"Excuse me," I said, "but the answer is here." I laid
my hand on the typewritten matter."When our sane and learned
lunatic made that very statement of how he used to consume
life, his mouth was actually nauseous with the flies and
spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs. Harker entered
the room."

Van Helsing smiled in turn. "Good!" he said. "Your
memory is true, friend John. I should have remembered. And
yet it is this very obliquity of thought and memory which
makes mental disease such a fascinating study. Perhaps I may
gain more knowledge out of the folly of this madman than I
shall from the teaching of the most wise. Who knows?"

I went on with my work, and before long was through that
in hand. It seemed that the time had been very short indeed,
but there was Van Helsing back in the study.

"Do I interrupt?" he asked politely as he stood at the
door.

"Not at all," I answered. "Come in. My work is finished,
and I am free. I can go with you now, if you like."

"It is needless, I have seen him!"

"Well?"

"I fear that he does not appraise me at much. Our inter-
view was short. When I entered his room he was sitting on
a stool in the center, with his elbows on his knees, and his
face was the picture of sullen discontent. I spoke to him
as cheerfully as I could, and with such a measure of respect
as I could assume. He made no reply whatever. 'Don't you
know me?' I asked. His answer was not reassuring. "I know
you well enough, you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish
you would take yourself and your idiotic brain theories
somewhere else. Damn all thick-headed Dutchmen!' Not a
word more would he say, but sat in his implacable sullenness
as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room
at all. Thus departed for this time my chance of much learn-
ing from this so clever lunatic, so I shall go, if I may,
and cheer myself with a few happy words with that sweet
soul Madam Mina. Friend John, it does rejoice me unspeakable
that she is no more to be pained, no more to be worried
with our terrible things. Though we shall much miss her
help, it is better so."

"I agree with you with all my heart," I answered ear-
nestly, for I did not want him to weaken in this matter.
"Mrs. Harker is better out of it. Things are quite bad
enough for us, all men of the world, and who have been in
many tight places in our time, but it is no place for a
woman, and if she had remained in touch with the affair,
it would in time infallibly have wrecked her."

So Van Helsing has gone to confer with Mrs. Harker
and Harker, Quincey and Art are all out following up the
clues as to the earth boxes. I shall finish my round of
work and we shall meet tonight.





MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


1 October.--It is strange to me to be kept in the dark
as I am today, after Jonathan's full confidence for so many
years, to see him manifestly avoid certain matters, and those
the most vital of all. This morning I slept late after the
fatigues of yesterday, and though Jonathan was late too, he
was the earlier. He spoke to me before he went out, never
more sweetly or tenderly, but he never mentioned a word of
what had happened in the visit to the Count's house. And yet
he must have known how terribly anxious I was. Poor dear
fellow! I suppose it must have distressed him even more than
it did me. They all agreed that it was best that I should
not be drawn further into this awful work, and I acquiesced.
But to think that he keeps anything from me! And now I am
crying like a silly fool, when I know it comes from my hus-
band's great love and from the good, good wishes of those
other strong men.

That has done me good. Well, some day Jonathan will
tell me all. And lest it should ever be that he should
think for a moment that I kept anything from him, I still
keep my journal as usual. Then if he has feared of my trust
I shall show it to him, with every thought of my heart put
down for his dear eyes to read. I feel strangely sad and
low-spirited today. I suppose it is the reaction from the
terrible excitement.

Last night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply
because they told me to. I didn't feel sleepy, and I did
feel full of devouring anxiety. I kept thinking over every-
thing that has been ever since Jonathan came to see me in
London, and it all seems like a horrible tragedy, with fate
pressing on relentlessly to some destined end. Everything
that one does seems, no matter how right it me be, to bring
on the very thing which is most to be deplored. If I hadn't
gone to Whitby, perhaps poor dear Lucy would be with us now.
She hadn't taken to visiting the churchyard till I came, and
if she hadn't come there in the day time with me she
wouldn't have walked in her sleep. And if she hadn't gone
there at night and asleep, that monster couldn't have des-
troyed her as he did. Oh, why did I ever go to Whitby? There
now, crying again! I wonder what has come over me today. I
must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knew that I had been
crying twice in one morning. . .I, who never cried on my
own account, and whom he has never caused to shed a tear, the
dear fellow would fret his heart out. I shall put a bold face
on, and if I do feel weepy, he shall never see it. I suppose
it is just one of the lessons that we poor women have to
learn. . .

I can't quite remember how I fell asleep last night. I
remember hearing the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of
queer sounds, like praying on a very tumultuous scale, from
Mr. Renfield's room, which is somewhere under this. And then
there was silence over everything, silence so profound that
it startled me, and I got up and looked out of the window.  All
was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moon-
light seeming full of a silent mystery of their own. Not a
thing seemed to be stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as
death or fate, so that a thin streak of white mist, that crept
with almost imperceptible slowness across the grass towards
the house, seemed to have a sentience and a vitality of its
own. I think that the digression of my thoughts must have
done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy
creeping over me. I lay a while, but could not quite sleep,
so I got out and looked out of the window again. The mist
was spreading, and was now close up to the house, so that I
could see it lying thick against the wall, as though it were
stealing up to the windows. The poor man was more loud than
ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said, I
could in some way recognize in his tones some passionate en-
treaty on his part. Then there was the sound of a struggle,
and I knew that the attendants were dealing with him. I was
so frightened that I crept into bed, and pulled the clothes
over my head, putting my fingers in my ears. I was not then
a bit sleepy, at least so I thought, but I must have fallen
asleep, for except dreams, I do not remember anything until
the morning, when Jonathan woke me. I think that it took me
an effort and a little time to realize where I was, and that
it was Jonathan who was bending over me. My dream was very
peculiar, and was almost typical of the way that waking
thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.

I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to
come back. I was very anxious about him, and I was powerless
to act, my feet, and my hands, and my brain were weighted, so
that nothing could proceed at the usual pace. And so I slept
uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn upon me that the
air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the clothes
from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim
around. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but
turned down, came only like a tiny red spark through the fog,
which had evidently grown thicker and poured into the room.
Then it occurred to me that I had shut the window before I
had come to bed. I would have got out to make certain on the
point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my limbs and
even my will. I lay still and endured, that was all. I closed
my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It is won-
derful what tricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently
we can imagine.) The mist grew thicker and thicker and I
could see now how it came in, for I could see it like smoke,
or with the white energy of boiling water, pouring in, not
through the window, but through the joinings of the door. It
got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became con-
centrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through
the top of which I could see the light of the gas shining
like a red eye. Things began to whirl through my brain just
as the cloudy column was now whirling in the room, and
through it all came the scriptural words "a pillar of cloud
by day and of fire by night." Was it indeed such spiritual
guidance that was coming to me in my sleep? But the pillar
was composed of both the day and the night guiding, for the
fire was in the red eye, which at the thought gat a new fas-
cination for me, till, as I looked, the fire divided, and
seemed to shine on me through the fog like two red eyes, such
as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering when, on
the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary's
Church. Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus
that Jonathan had seen those awful women growing into real-
ity through the whirling mist in the moonlight, and in my
dream I must have fainted, for all became black darkness. The
last conscious effort which imagination made was to show me
a livid white face bending over me out of the mist.

I must be careful of such dreams, for they would unseat
one's reason if there were too much of them. I would get
Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe something for me
which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarm them.
Such a dream at the present time would become woven into
their fears for me. Tonight I shall strive hard to sleep
naturally. If I do not, I shall tomorrow night get them to
give me a dose of chloral, that cannot hurt me for once, and
it will give me a good night's sleep. Last night tired me
more than if I had not slept at all.


2 October 10 P.M.--Last night I slept, but did not
dream. I must have slept soundly, for I was not waked by
Jonathan coming to bed, but the sleep has not refreshed me,
for today I feel terribly weak and spiritless. I spent all
yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing. In the after-
noon, Mr. Renfield asked if he might see me. Poor man, he was
very gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade
God bless me. Some way it affected me much. I am crying when
I think of him. This is a new weakness, of which I must be
careful. Jonathan would be miserable if he knew I had been
crying. He and the others were out till dinner time, and they
all came in tired. I did what I could to brighten them up,
and I suppose that the effort did me good, for I forgot how
tired I was. After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went
off to smoke together, as they said, but I knew that they
wanted to tell each other of what had occurred to each
during the day. I could see from Jonathan's manner that he
had something important to communicate. I was not so sleepy
as I should have been, so before they went I asked Dr. Seward
to give me a little opiate of some kind, as I had not slept
well the night before. He very kindly made me up a sleeping
draught, which he gave to me, telling me that it would do me
no harm, as it was very mild. . .I have taken it, and am
waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof. I hope I have not
done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear
comes, that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself
of the power of waking. I might want it. Here comes sleep.
Goodnight.





CHAPTER 20


JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


1 October, evening.--I found Thomas Snelling in his
house at Bethnal Green, but unhappily he was not in a condi-
tion to remember anything. The very prospect of beer which
my expected coming had opened to him had proved too much, and
he had begun too early on his expected debauch. I learned,
however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor soul, that
he was only the assistant of Smollet, who of the two mates
was the responsible person. So off I drove to Walworth, and
found Mr. Joseph Smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves,
taking a late tea out of a saucer. He is a decent, intell-
igent fellow, distinctly a good, reliable type of workman,
and with a headpiece of his own. He remembered all about the
incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful dog-eared note-
book, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about
the seat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical
entries in thick, half-obliterated pencil, he gave me the
destinations of the boxes. There were, he said, six in the
cartload which he took from Carfax and left at 197 Chicksand
Street, Mile End New Town, and another six which he deposited
at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey. If then the Count meant to
scatter these ghastly refuges of his over London, these
places were chosen as the first of delivery, so that later he
might distribute more fully. The systematic manner in which
this was done made me think that he could not mean to con-
fine himself to two sides of London. He was now fixed on the
far east on the northern shore, on the east of the southern
shore, and on the south. The north and west were surely never
meant to be left out of his diabolical scheme, let alone the
City itself and the very heart of fashionable London in the
south-west and west. I went back to Smollet, and asked him if
he could tell us if any other boxes had been taken from
Carfax.

He replied, "Well guv'nor, you've treated me very
'an'some", I had given him half a sovereign, "an I'll tell
yer all I know. I heard a man by the name of Bloxam say four
nights ago in the 'Are an' 'Ounds, in Pincher's Alley, as
'ow he an' his mate 'ad 'ad a rare dusty job in a old 'ouse
at Purfleet. There ain't a many such jobs as this 'ere, an'
I'm thinkin' that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut."

I asked if he could tell me where to find him. I told
him that if he could get me the address it would be worth
another half sovereign to him. So he gulped down the rest
of his tea and stood up, saying that he was going to begin
the search then and there.

At the door he stopped, and said, "Look 'ere, guv'nor,
there ain't no sense in me a keepin' you 'ere. I may find
Sam soon, or I mayn't, but anyhow he ain't like to be in a
way to tell ye much tonight. Sam is a rare one when he starts
on the booze. If you can give me a envelope with a stamp on
it, and put yer address on it, I'll find out where Sam is to
be found and post it ye tonight. But ye'd better be up arter
'im soon in the mornin', never mind the booze the night
afore."

This was all practical, so one of the children went off
with a penny to buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to
keep the change. When she came back, I addressed the envelope
and stamped it, and when Smollet had again faithfully pro-
mised to post the address when found, I took my way to home.
We're on the track anyhow. I am tired tonight, and I want to
sleep. Mina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale. Her
eyes look as though she had been crying. Poor dear, I've no
doubt it frets her to be kept in the dark, and it may make
her doubly anxious about me and the others. But it is best
as it is. It is better to be disappointed and worried in such
a way now than to have her nerve broken. The doctors were
quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful
business. I must be firm, for on me this particular burden
of silence must rest. I shall not ever enter on the subject
with her under any circumstances. Indeed, It may not be a hard
task, after all, for she herself has become reticent on the
subject, and has not spoken of the Count or his doings ever
since we told her of our decision.


2 October, evening--A long and trying and exciting day.
By the first post I got my directed envelope with a dirty
scrap of paper enclosed, on which was written with a carpen-
ter's pencil in a sprawling hand, "Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4
Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth. Arsk for the depite."

I got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina.
She looked heavy and sleepy and pale, and far from well. I
determined not to wake her, but that when I should return
from this new search, I would arrange for her going back to
Exeter. I think she would be happier in our own home, with
her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst
us and in ignorance. I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment,
and told him where I was off to, promising to come back and
tell the rest so soon as I should have found out anything. I
drove to Walworth and found, with some difficulty, Potter's
Court. Mr. Smollet's spelling misled me, as I asked for
Poter's Court instead of Potter's Court. However, when I
had found the court, I had no difficulty in discovering Cor-
coran's lodging house.

When I asked the man who came to the door for the
"depite," he shook his head, and said, "I dunno 'im. There
ain't no such a person 'ere. I never 'eard of 'im in all my
bloomin' days. Don't believe there ain't nobody of that kind
livin' 'ere or anywheres."

I took out Smollet's letter, and as I read it it seemed
to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name of the
court might guide me. "What are you?" I asked.

"I'm the depity," he answered.

I saw at once that I was on the right track. Phonetic
spelling had again misled me. A half crown tip put the
deputy's knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr.
Bloxam, who had slept off the remains of his beer on the
previous night at Corcoran's, had left for his work at Poplar
at five o'clock that morning. He could not tell me where the
place of work was situated, but he had a vague idea that it
was some kind of a "new-fangled ware'us," and with this
slender clue I had to start for Poplar. It was twelve o'clock
before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and
this I got at a coffee shop, where some workmen were having
their dinner. One of them suggested that there was being
erected at Cross Angel Street a new "cold storage" building,
and as this suited the condition of a "new-fangled ware'us,"
I at once drove to it. An interview with a surly gatekeeper
and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the
coin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam. He was
sent for on my suggestion that I was willing to pay his days
wages to his foreman for the privilege of asking him a few
questions on a private matter. He was a smart enough fellow,
though rough of speech and bearing. When I had promised to
pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told me
that he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in
Piccadilly, and had taken from this house to the latter nine
great boxes, "main heavy ones," with a horse and cart hired
by him for this purpose.

I asked him if he could tell me the number of the
house in Piccadilly, to which he replied, "Well, guv'nor, I
forgits the number, but it was only a few door from a big
white church, or somethink of the kind, not long built. It
was a dusty old 'ouse, too, though nothin' to the dustiness
of the 'ouse we tooked the bloomin' boxes from."

"How did you get in if both houses were empty?"

"There was the old party what engaged me a waitin' in
the 'ouse at Purfleet. He 'elped me to lift the boxes and
put them in the dray. Curse me, but he was the strongest
chap I ever struck, an' him a old feller, with a white mous-
tache, one that thin you would think he couldn't throw a
shadder."

How this phrase thrilled through me!

"Why, 'e took up 'is end o' the boxes like they was
pounds of tea, and me a puffin' an' a blowin' afore I could
upend mine anyhow, an' I'm no chicken, neither."

"How did you get into the house in Piccadilly?" I asked.

"He was there too. He must 'a started off and got there
afore me, for when I rung of the bell he kem an' opened the
door 'isself an' 'elped me carry the boxes into the 'all."

"The whole nine?" I asked.

"Yus, there was five in the first load an' four in the
second. It was main dry work, an' I don't so well remember
'ow I got 'ome."

I interrupted him, "Were the boxes left in the hall?"

"Yus, it was a big 'all, an' there was nothin' else in
it."

I made one more attempt to further matters. "You didn't
have any key?"

"Never used no key nor nothink. The old gent, he opened
the door 'isself an' shut it again when I druv off. I don't
remember the last time, but that was the beer."

"And you can't remember the number of the house?"

"No, sir. But ye needn't have no difficulty about that.
It's a 'igh 'un with a stone front with a bow on it, an'
'igh steps up to the door. I know them steps, 'avin' 'ad to
carry the boxes up with three loafers what come round to
earn a copper. The old gent give them shillin's, an' they
seein' they got so much, they wanted more. But 'e took one
of them by the shoulder and was like to throw 'im down the
steps, till the lot of them went away cussin'."

I thought that with this description I could find the
house, so having paid my friend for his information, I start-
ed off for Piccadilly. I had gained a new painful experience.
The Count could, it was evident, handle the earth boxes him-
self. If so, time was precious, for now that he had achieved
a certain amount of distribution, he could, by choosing his
own time, complete the task unobserved. At Piccadilly Circus
I discharged my cab, and walked westward. Beyond the Junior
Constitutional I came across the house described and was sat-
isfied that this was the next of the lairs arranged by
Dracula. The house looked as though it had been long unten-
anted. The windows were encrusted with dust, and the
shutters were up. All the framework was black with time, and
from the iron the paint had mostly scaled away. It was evi-
dent that up to lately there had been a large notice board
in front of the balcony. It had, however, been roughly torn
away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining.
Behind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose
boards, whose raw edges looked white. I would have given a
good deal to have been able to see the notice board intact,
as it would, perhaps, have given some clue to the ownership
of the house. I remembered my experience of the investiga-
tion and purchase of Carfax, and I could not but feel that I
could find the former owner there might be some means disco-
vered of gaining access to the house.

There was at present nothing to be learned from the
Piccadilly side, and nothing could be done, so I went around
to the back to see if anything could be gathered from this
quarter. The mews were active, the Piccadilly houses being
mostly in occupation. I asked one or two of the grooms and
helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anything
about the empty house. One of them said that he heard it had
lately been taken, but he couldn't say from whom. He told me,
however, that up to very lately there had been a notice board
of "For Sale" up, and that perhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy
the house agents could tell me something, as he thought he
remembered seeing the name of that firm on the board. I did
not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know or
guess too much, so thanking him in the usual manner, I strol-
led away. It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was
closing in, so I did not lose any time. Having learned the
address of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy from a directory at the
Berkeley, I was soon at their office in Sackville Street.

The gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in man-
ner, but uncommunicative in equal proportion. Having once
told me that the Piccadilly house, which throughout our in-
terview he called a "mansion," was sold, he considered my
business as concluded. When I asked who had purchased it, he
opened his eyes a thought wider, and paused a few seconds
before replying, "It is sold, sir."

"Pardon me," I said, with equal politeness, "but I have
a special reason for wishing to know who purchased it."

Again he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still
more. "It is sold, sir," was again his laconic reply.

"Surely," I said, "you do not mind letting me know so
much."

"But I do mind," he answered. "The affairs of their
clients are absolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons,
& Candy."

This was manifestly a prig of the first water, and there
was no use arguing with him. I thought I had best meet him
on his own ground, so I said, "Your clients, sir, are happy
in having so resolute a guardian of their confidence. I am
myself a professional man."

Here I handed him my card. "In this instance I am not
prompted by curiosity, I act on the part of Lord Godalming,
who wishes to know something of the property which was, he
understood, lately for sale."

These words put a different complexion on affairs. He
said, "I would like to oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker,
and especially would I like to oblige his lordship. We once
carried out a small matter of renting some chambers for him
when he was the Honorable Arthur Holmwood. If you will let
me have his lordship's address I will consult the House on
the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with his
lordship by tonight's post. It will be a pleasure if we can
so far deviate from our rules as to give the required infor-
mation to his lordship."

I wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy,
so I thanked him, gave the address at Dr. Seward's and came
away. It was now dark, and I was tired and hungry. I got
a cup of tea at the Aerated Bread Company and came down to
Purfleet by the next train.

I found all the others at home. Mina was looking tired
and pale, but she made a gallant effort to be bright and
cheerful. It wrung my heart to think that I had had to keep
anything from her and so caused her inquietude. Thank God,
this will be the last night of her looking on at our con-
ferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our con-
fidence. It took all my courage to hold to the wise reso-
lution of keeping her out of our grim task. She seems some-
how more reconciled, or else the very subject seems to have
become repugnant to her, for when any accidental allusion is
made she actually shudders. I am glad we made our resolution
in time, as with such a feeling as this, our growing knowledge
would be torture to her.

I could not tell the others of the day's discovery till
we were alone, so after dinner, followed by a little music
to save appearances even amongst ourselves, I took Mina to
her room and left her to go to bed. The dear girl was more
affectionate with me than ever, and clung to me as though she
would detain me, but there was much to be talked of and I
came away. Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made
no difference between us.

When I came down again I found the others all gathered
round the fire in the study. In the train I had written my
diary so far, and simply read it off to them as the best
means of letting them get abreast of my own information.

When I had finished Van Helsing said, "This has been a
great day's work, friend Jonathan. Doubtless we are on the
track of the missing boxes. If we find them all in that
house, then our work is near the end. But if there be some
missing, we must search until we find them. Then shall we
make our final coup, and hunt the wretch to his real death."

We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr. Morris
spoke, "Say! How are we going to get into that house?"

"We got into the other," answered Lord Godalming quickly.

"But, Art, this is different. We broke house at Carfax,
but we had night and a walled park to protect us. It will be
a mighty different thing to commit burglary in Piccadilly,
either by day or night. I confess I don't see how we are
going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key of
some sort."

Lord Godalming's brows contracted, and he stood up and
walked about the room.  By-and-by he stopped and said, turning
from one to another of us, "Quincey's head is level. This
burglary business is getting serious. We got off once all
right, but we have now a rare job on hand. Unless we can
find the Count's key basket."

As nothing could well be done before morning, and as it
would be at least advisable to wait till Lord Godalming
should hear from Mitchell's, we decided not to take any ac-
tive step before breakfast time. For a good while we sat
and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights and
bearings. I took the opportunity of bringing this diary
right up to the moment. I am very sleepy and shall go to
bed. . .

Just a line. Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is
regular. Her forehead is puckered up into little wrinkles,
as though she thinks even in her sleep. She is still too
pale, but does not look so haggard as she did this morning.
Tomorrow will, I hope, mend all this. She will be herself
at home in Exeter. Oh, but I am sleepy!




DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


1 October.--I am puzzled afresh about Renfield. His
moods change so rapidly that I find it difficult to keep
touch of them, and as they always mean something more than
his own well-being, they form a more than interesting study.
This morning, when I went to see him after his repulse of
Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny.
He was, in fact, commanding destiny, subjectively. He did not
really care for any of the things of mere earth, he was in
the clouds and looked down on all the weaknesses and wants
of us poor mortals.

I thought I would improve the occasion and learn some-
thing, so I asked him, "What about the flies these times?"

He smiled on me in quite a superior sort of way, such
a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio, as he
answered me, "The fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature.
It's wings are typical of the aerial powers of the psychic
faculties. The ancients did well when they typified the soul
as a butterfly!"

I thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logi-
cally, so I said quickly, "Oh, it is a soul you are after
now, is it?"

His madness foiled his reason, and a puzzled look spread
over his face as, shaking his head with a decision which I
had but seldom seen in him.

He said, "Oh, no, oh no! I want no souls. Life is all
I want." Here he brightened up. "I am pretty indifferent
about it at present. Life is all right. I have all I want.
You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wish to study
zoophagy!"

This puzzled me a little, so I drew him on. "Then you
command life. You are a god, I suppose?"

He smiled with an ineffably benign superiority. "Oh no!
Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of
the Deity. I am not even concerned in His especially spirit-
ual doings. If I may state my intellectual position I am,
so far as concerns things purely terrestrial, somewhat in the
position which Enoch occupied spiritually!"

This was a poser to me. I could not at the moment recall
Enoch's appositeness, so I had to ask a simple question,
though I felt that by so doing I was lowering myself in the
eyes of the lunatic. "And why with Enoch?"

"Because he walked with God."

I could not see the analogy, but did not like to admit
it, so I harked back to what he had denied. "So you don't
care about life and you don't want souls. Why not?" I put
my question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to dis-
concert him.

The effort succeeded, for an instant he unconsciously
relapsed into his old servile manner, bent low before me,
and actually fawned upon me as he replied. "I don't want
any souls, indeed, indeed! I don't. I couldn't use them if
I had them. They would be no manner of use to me. I couldn't
eat them or. . ."

He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread
over his face, like a wind sweep on the surface of the water.

"And doctor, as to life, what is it after all? When
you've got all you require, and you know that you will never
want, that is all. I have friends, good friends, like you,
Dr. Seward."This was said with a leer of inexpressible cunn-
ing. "I know that I shall never lack the means of life!"

I think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he
saw some antagonism in me, for he at once fell back on the
last refuge of such as he, a dogged silence. After a short
time I saw that for the present it was useless to speak to
him. He was sulky, and so I came away.

Later in the day he sent for me. Ordinarily I would
not have come without special reason, but just at present
I am so interested in him that I would gladly make an effort.
Besides, I am glad to have anything to help pass the time.
Harker is out, following up clues, and so are Lord Godalming
and Quincey. Van Helsing sits in my study poring over the
record prepared by the Harkers. He seems to think that by
accurate knowledge of all details he will light up on some
clue. He does not wish to be disturbed in the work, without
cause. I would have taken him with me to see the patient,
only I thought that after his last repulse he might not care
to go again. There was also another reason. Renfield might
not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I
were alone.

I found him sitting in the middle of the floor on his
stool, a pose which is generally indicative of some mental
energy on his part. When I came in, he said at once, as
though the question had been waiting on his lips. "What
about souls?"

It was evident then that my surmise had been correct.
Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the
lunatic. I determined to have the matter out.

"What about them yourself?" I asked.

He did not reply for a moment but looked all around him,
and up and down, as though he expected to find some inspira-
tion for an answer.

"I don't want any souls!" He said in a feeble, apolo-
getic way. The matter seemed preying on his mind, and so I
determined to use it, to "be cruel only to be kind." So I
said, "You like life, and you want life?"

"Oh yes! But that is all right. You needn't worry about
that!"

"But," I asked, "how are we to get the life without get-
ting the soul also?"

This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up, "A nice
time you'll have some time when you're flying out here, with
the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and
cats buzzing and twittering and moaning all around you.
You've got their lives, you know, and you must put up with
their souls!"

Something seemed to affect his imagination, for he put
his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes, screwing them up
tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being
soaped. There was something pathetic in it that touched me.
It also gave me a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a
child, only a child, though the features were worn, and the
stubble on the jaws was white. It was evident that he was
undergoing some process of mental disturbance, and knowing
how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign
to himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as
I could and go with him

The first step was to restore confidence, so I asked
him, speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through
his closed ears, "Would you like some sugar to get your flies
around again?"

He seemed to wake up all at once, and shook his head.
With a laugh he replied, "Not much! Flies are poor things,
after all!" After a pause he added, "But I don't want their
souls buzzing round me, all the same."

"Or spiders?" I went on.

"Blow spiders! What's the use of spiders? There isn't
anything in them to eat or. . ." He stopped suddenly as
though reminded of a forbidden topic.

"So, so!" I thought to myself, "this is the second time
he has suddenly stopped at the word `drink'. What does it
mean?"

Renfield seemed himself aware of having made a lapse,
for he hurried on, as though to distract my attention from
it, "I don't take any stock at all in such matters. `Rats
and mice and such small deer,' as Shakespeare has it,
`chicken feed of the larder' they might be called. I'm past
all that sort of nonsense. You might as well ask a man to
eat molecules with a pair of chopsticks, as to try to inter-
est me about the less carnivora, when I know of what is
before me."

"I see," I said."You want big things that you can make
your teeth meet in? How would you like to breakfast on an
elephant?"

"What ridiculous nonsense you are talking?" He was
getting too wide awake, so I thought I would press him hard.

"I wonder," I said reflectively, "what an elephant's
soul is like!"

The effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell
from his high-horse and became a child again.

"I don't want an elephant's soul, or any soul at all!"
he said. For a few moments he sat despondently. Suddenly
he jumped to his feet, with his eyes blazing and all the
signs of intense cerebral excitement. "To hell with you and
your souls!" he shouted. "Why do you plague me about souls?
Haven't I got enough to worry, and pain, to distract me al-
ready, without thinking of souls?"

He looked so hostile that I thought he was in for anot-
her homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle.

The instant, however, that I did so he became calm, and
said apologetically, "Forgive me, Doctor. I forgot myself.
You do not need any help. I am so worried in my mind that I
am apt to be irritable. If you only knew the problem I have
to face, and that I am working out, you would pity, and tol-
erate, and pardon me. Pray do not put me in a strait waist-
coat. I want to think and I cannot think freely when my body
is confined. I am sure you will understand!"

He had evidently self-control, so when the attendants
came I told them not to mind, and they withdrew. Renfield
watched them go. When the door was closed he said with con-
siderable dignity and sweetness, "Dr. Seward, you have been
very considerate towards me. Believe me that I am very, very
grateful to you!"

I thought it well to leave him in this mood, and so I
came away. There is certainly something to ponder over in
this man's state. Several points seem to make what the
American interviewer calls "a story," if one could only get
them in proper order. Here they are:

Will not mention "drinking."

Fears the thought of being burdened with the "soul" of
anything.

Has no dread of wanting "life" in the future.

Despises the meaner forms of life altogether, though he
dreads being haunted by their souls.

Logically all these things point one way! He has assu-
rance of some kind that he will acquire some higher life.

He dreads the consequence, the burden of a soul. Then it
is a human life he looks to!

And the assurance. . .?

Merciful God! The Count has been to him, and there is
some new scheme of terror afoot!


Later.--I went after my round to Van Helsing and told
him my suspicion. He grew very grave, and after thinking the
matter over for a while asked me to take him to Renfield. I
did so. As we came to the door we heard the lunatic within
singing gaily, as he used to do in the time which now seems
so long ago.

When we entered we saw with amazement that he had
spread out his sugar as of old. The flies, lethargic with
the autumn, were beginning to buzz into the room. We tried
to make him talk of the subject of our previous conversation,
but he would not attend. He went on with his singing, just
as though we had not been present. He had got a scrap of
paper and was folding it into a notebook. We had to come
away as ignorant as we went in.

His is a curious case indeed. We must watch him tonight.





LETTER, MITCHELL, SONS & CANDY TO LORD GODALMING.


"1 October.

"My Lord,

"We are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes.
We beg, with regard to the desire of your Lordship, expressed
by Mr. Harker on your behalf, to supply the following infor-
mation concerning the sale and purchase of No. 347, Piccadilly.
The original vendors are the executors of the late Mr. Arch-
ibald Winter-Suffield. The purchaser is a foreign nobleman,
Count de Ville, who effected the purchase himself paying the
purchase money in notes `over the counter,' if your Lordship
will pardon us using so vulgar an expression. Beyond this we
know nothing whatever of him.

"We are, my Lord,

"Your Lordship's humble servants,

"MITCHELL, SONS & CANDY."




DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


2 October.--I placed a man in the corridor last night,
and told him to make an accurate note of any sound he might
hear from Renfield's room, and gave him instructions that
if there should be anything strange he was to call me. After
dinner, when we had all gathered round the fire in the study,
Mrs. Harker having gone to bed, we discussed the attempts and
discoveries of the day. Harker was the only one who had any
result, and we are in great hopes that his clue may be an
important one.

Before going to bed I went round to the patient's room
and looked in through the observation trap. He was sleeping
soundly, his heart rose and fell with regular respiration.

This morning the man on duty reported to me that a
little after midnight he was restless and kept saying his
prayers somewhat loudly. I asked him if that was all. He
replied that it was all he heard. There was something about
his manner, so suspicious that I asked him point blank if he
had been asleep. He denied sleep, but admitted to having
"dozed" for a while. It is too bad that men cannot be trusted
unless they are watched.

Today Harker is out following up his clue, and Art and
Quincey are looking after horses. Godalming thinks that it
will be well to have horses always in readiness, for when
we get the information which we seek there will be no time
to lose. We must sterilize all the imported earth between
sunrise and sunset. We shall thus catch the Count at his
weakest, and without a refuge to fly to. Van Helsing is off
to the British Museum looking up some authorities on ancient
medicine. The old physicians took account of things which
their followers do not accept, and the Professor is searching
for witch and demon cures which may be useful to us later.

I sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall
wake to sanity in strait waistcoats.

Later.--We have met again. We seem at last to be on the track,
and our work of tomorrow may be the beginning of the end. I
wonder if Renfield's quiet has anything to do with this. His
moods have so followed the doings of the Count, that the
coming destruction of the monster may be carried to him some
subtle way. If we could only get some hint as to what passed
in his mind, between the time of my argument with him today
and his resumption of fly-catching, it might afford us a
valuable clue. He is now seemingly quiet for a spell. . .
Is he? That wild yell seemed to come from his room. . .

The attendant came bursting into my room and told me
that Renfield had somehow met with some accident. He had
heard him yell, and when he went to him found him lying on
his face on the floor, all covered with blood. I must go at
once. . .





CHAPTER 21


DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


3 October.--Let me put down with exactness all that
happened, as well as I can remember, since last I made an
entry. Not a detail that I can recall must be forgotten. In
all calmness I must proceed.

When I came to Renfield's room I found him lying on the
floor on his left side in a glittering pool of blood. When I
went to move him, it became at once apparent that he had re-
ceived some terrible injuries. There seemed none of the unity
of purpose between the parts of the body which marks even
lethargic sanity. As the face was exposed I could see that
it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against
the floor. Indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool
of blood originated.

The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to
me as we turned him over, "I think, sir, his back is broken.
See, both his right arm and leg and the whole side of his
face are paralysed." How such a thing could have happened
puzzled the attendant beyond measure. He seemed quite bewil-
dered, and his brows were gathered in as he said, "I can't
understand the two things. He could mark his face like that
by beating his own head on the floor. I saw a young woman do
it once at the Eversfield Asylum before anyone could lay
hands on her. And I suppose he might have broken his neck by
falling out of bed, if he got in an awkward kink. But for
the life of me I can't imagine how the two things occurred.
If his back was broke, he couldn't beat his head, and if his
face was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be
marks of it."

I said to him, "Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to
kindly come here at once. I want him without an instant's
delay."

The man ran off, and within a few minutes the Professor,
in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared. When he saw
Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, and
then turned to me. I think he recognized my thought in my
eyes, for he said very quietly, manifestly for the ears of
the attendant, "Ah, a sad accident! He will need very care-
ful watching, and much attention. I shall stay with you my-
self, but I shall first dress myself. If you will remain I
shall in a few minutes join you."

The patient was now breathing stertorously and it was
easy to see that he had suffered some terrible injury.

Van Helsing returned with extraordinary celerity, bear-
ing with him a surgical case. He had evidently been thinking
and had his mind made up, for almost before he looked at the
patient, he whispered to me, "Send the attendant away. We
must be alone with him when he becomes conscious, after the
operation."

I said, "I think that will do now, Simmons. We have
done all that we can at present. You had better go your
round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate. Let me know instant-
ly if there be anything unusual anywhere."

The man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination
of the patient. The wounds of the face were superficial. The
real injury was a depressed fracture of the skull, extending
right up through the motor area.

The Professor thought a moment and said, "We must reduce
the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far as can
be. The rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature
of his injury. The whole motor area seems affected. The
suffusion of the brain will increase quickly, so we must tre-
phine at once or it may be too late."

As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door.
I went over and opened it and found in the corridor without,
Arthur and Quincey in pajamas and slippers, the former spoke,
"I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an
accident. So I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he
was not asleep. Things are moving too quickly and too
strangely for sound sleep for any of us these times. I've
been thinking that tomorrow night will not see things as
they have been. We'll have to look back, and forward a
little more than we have done. May we come in?"

I nodded, and held the door open till they had entered,
then I closed it again. When Quincey saw the attitude and
state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the
floor, he said softly, "My God! What has happened to him?
Poor, poor devil!"

I told him briefly, and added that we expected he would
recover consciousness after the operation, for a short time,
at all events. He went at once and sat down on the edge of
the bed, with Godalming beside him. We all watched in
patience.

"We shall wait," said Van Helsing, "just long enough to
fix the best spot for trephining, so that we may most quickly
and perfectly remove the blood clot, for it is evident that
the haemorrhage is increasing."

The minutes during which we waited passed with fearful
slowness. I had a horrible sinking in my heart, and from
Van Helsing's face I gathered that he felt some fear or
apprehension as to what was to come. I dreaded the words
Renfield might speak. I was positively afraid to think. But
the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read
of men who have heard the death watch. The poor man's breath-
ing came in uncertain gasps. Each instant he seemed as though
he would open his eyes and speak, but then would follow a
prolonged stertorous breath, and he would relapse into a more
fixed insensibility. Inured as I was to sick beds and death,
this suspense grew and grew upon me. I could almost hear the
beating of my own heart, and the blood surging through my
temples sounded like blows from a hammer. The silence finally
became agonizing. I looked at my companions, one after ano-
ther, and saw from their flushed faces and damp brows that
they were enduring equal torture. There was a nervous sus-
pense over us all, as though overhead some dread bell would
peal out powerfully when we should least expect it.

At last there came a time when it was evident that the
patient was sinking fast. He might die at any moment. I
looked up at the Professor and caught his eyes fixed on mine.
His face was sternly set as he spoke, "There is no time to
lose. His words may be worth many lives. I have been think-
ing so, as I stood here. It may be there is a soul at stake!
We shall operate just above the ear."

Without another word he made the operation. For a few
moments the breathing continued to be stertorous. Then there
came a breath so prolonged that it seemed as though it would
tear open his chest. Suddenly his eyes opened, and became
fixed in a wild, helpless stare. This was continued for a few
moments, then it was softened into a glad surprise, and from
his lips came a sigh of relief. He moved convulsively, and as
he did so, said, "I'll be quiet, Doctor. Tell them to take
off the strait waistcoat. I have had a terrible dream, and
it has left me so weak that I cannot move. What's wrong with
my face? It feels all swollen, and it smarts dreadfully."

He tried to turn his head, but even with the effort his
eyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back.
Then Van Helsing said in a quiet grave tone, "Tell us your
dream, Mr. Renfield."

As he heard the voice his face brightened, through its
mutilation, and he said, "That is Dr. Van Helsing. How
good it is of you to be here. Give me some water, my lips
are dry, and I shall try to tell you. I dreamed". . .

He stopped and seemed fainting. I called quietly to
Quincey, "The brandy, it is in my study, quick!" He flew
and returned with a glass, the decanter of brandy and a
carafe of water. We moistened the parched lips, and the
patient quickly revived.

It seemed, however, that his poor injured brain had
been working in the interval, for when he was quite conscious,
he looked at me piercingly with an agonized confusion which
I shall never forget, and said, "I must not deceive myself.
It was no dream, but all a grim reality." Then his eyes
roved round the room. As they caught sight of the two
figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on,
"If I were not sure already, I would know from them."

For an instant his eyes closed, not with pain or sleep
but voluntarily, as though he were bringing all his faculties
to bear. When he opened them he said, hurriedly, and with
more energy than he had yet displayed, "Quick, Doctor, quick,
I am dying! I feel that I have but a few minutes, and then I
must go back to death, or worse! Wet my lips with brandy
again. I have something that I must say before I die. Or
before my poor crushed brain dies anyhow. Thank you! It was
that night after you left me, when I implored you to let me
go away. I couldn't speak then, for I felt my tongue was
tied. But I was as sane then, except in that way, as I am
now. I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you
left me, it seemed hours. Then there came a sudden peace to
me. My brain seemed to become cool again, and I realized
where I was. I heard the dogs bark behind our house, but not
where He was!"

As he spoke, Van Helsing's eyes never blinked, but his
hand came out and met mine and gripped it hard. He did not,
however, betray himself. He nodded slightly and said, "Go
on," in a low voice.

Renfield proceeded. "He came up to the window in the
mist, as I had seen him often before, but he was solid then,
not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce like a man's when
angry. He was laughing with his red mouth, the sharp white
teeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back
over the belt of trees, to where the dogs were barking. I
wouldn't ask him to come in at first, though I knew he wanted
to, just as he had wanted all along. Then he began promising
me things, not in words but by doing them."

He was interrupted by a word from the Professor, "How?"

"By making them happen. Just as he used to send in the
flies when the sun was shining. Great big fat ones with
steel and sapphire on their wings. And big moths, in the
night, with skull and cross-bones on their backs."

Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me uncon-
sciously, "The Acherontia Atropos of the Sphinges, what you
call the `Death's-head Moth'?"

The patient went on without stopping, "Then he began
to whisper.`Rats, rats, rats! Hundreds, thousands, millions
of them, and every one a life.  And dogs to eat them, and cats
too. All lives! All red blood, with years of life in it, and
not merely buzzing flies!' I laughed at him, for I wanted to
see what he could do. Then the dogs howled, away beyond the
dark trees in His house. He beckoned me to the window. I got
up and looked out, and He raised his hands, and seemed to call
out without using any words. A dark mass spread over the
grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire. And then
He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that
there were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red,
like His only smaller. He held up his hand, and they all
stopped, and I thought he seemed to be saying, `All these
lives will I give you, ay, and many more and greater, through
countless ages, if you will fall down and worship me!' And
then a red cloud, like the color of blood, seemed to close
over my eyes, and before I knew what I was doing, I found
myself opening the sash and saying to Him, `Come in, Lord
and Master!' The rats were all gone, but He slid into the
room through the sash, though it was only open an inch wide,
just as the Moon herself has often come in through the tini-
est crack and has stood before me in all her size and
splendor."

His voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the
brandy again, and he continued, but it seemed as though his
memory had gone on working in the interval for his story was
further advanced. I was about to call him back to the point,
but Van Helsing whispered to me, "Let him go on. Do not
interrupt him. He cannot go back, and maybe could not pro-
ceed at all if once he lost the thread of his thought."

He proceeded, "All day I waited to hear from him, but
he did not send me anything, not even a blowfly, and when the
moon got up I was pretty angry with him. When he did slide in
through the window, though it was shut, and did not even
knock, I got mad with him. He sneered at me, and his white
face looked out of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and
he went on as though he owned the whole place, and I was no
one. He didn't even smell the same as he went by me. I
couldn't hold him. I thought that, somehow, Mrs. Harker had
come into the room."

The two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over,
standing behind him so that he could not see them, but where
they could hear better. They were both silent, but the Pro-
fessor started and quivered. His face, however, grew grimmer
and sterner still. Renfield went on without noticing, "When
Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn't the
same. It was like tea after the teapot has been watered."
Here we all moved, but no one said a word.

He went on, "I didn't know that she was here till she
spoke, and she didn't look the same. I don't care for the
pale people. I like them with lots of blood in them, and
hers all seemed to have run out. I didn't think of it at the
time, but when she went away I began to think, and it made me
mad to know that He had been taking the life out of her." I
could feel that the rest quivered, as I did. But we remained
otherwise still. "So when He came tonight I was ready for
Him. I saw the mist stealing in, and I grabbed it tight. I
had heard that madmen have unnatural strength. And as I knew
I was a madman, at times anyhow, I resolved to use my power.
Ay, and He felt it too, for He had to come out of the mist to
struggle with me. I held tight, and I thought I was going to
win, for I didn't mean Him to take any more of her life, till
I saw His eyes. They burned into me, and my strength became
like water. He slipped through it, and when I tried to cling
to Him, He raised me up and flung me down. There was a red
cloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemed
to steal away under the door."

His voice was becoming fainter and his breath more ster-
torous. Van Helsing stood up instinctively.

"We know the worst now," he said. "He is here, and we
know his purpose. It may not be too late. Let us be armed,
the same as we were the other night, but lose no time, there
is not an instant to spare."

There was no need to put our fear, nay our conviction,
into words, we shared them in common. We all hurried and
took from our rooms the same things that we had when we
entered the Count's house. The Professor had his ready, and
as we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly
as he said, "They never leave me, and they shall not till
this unhappy business is over. Be wise also, my friends. It
is no common enemy that we deal with Alas! Alas! That dear
Madam Mina should suffer!" He stopped, his voice was breaking,
and I do not know if rage or terror predominated in my own
heart.

Outside the Harkers' door we paused. Art and Quincey
held back, and the latter said, "Should we disturb her?"

"We must," said Van Helsing grimly. "If the door be
locked, I shall break it in."

"May it not frighten her terribly? It is unusual to
break into a lady's room!"

Van Helsing said solemnly, "You are always right. But
this is life and death. All chambers are alike to the doctor.
And even were they not they are all as one to me tonight.
Friend John, when I turn the handle, if the door does not
open, do you put your shoulder down and shove. And you too,
my friends. Now!"

He turned the handle as he spoke, but the door did not
yield. We threw ourselves against it. With a crash it burst
open, and we almost fell headlong into the room. The Pro-
fessor did actually fall, and I saw across him as he gathered
himself up from hands and knees. What I saw appalled me. I
felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck, and
my heart seemed to stand still.

The moonlight was so bright that through the thick
yellow blind the room was light enough to see. On the bed
beside the window lay Jonathan Harker, his face flushed and
breathing heavily as though in a stupor. Kneeling on the
near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad
figure of his wife. By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad
in black. His face was turned from us, but the instant we
saw we all recognized the Count, in every way, even to the
scar on his forehead. With his left hand he held both Mrs.
Harker's hands, keeping them away with her arms at full ten-
sion. His right hand gripped her by the back of the neck,
forcing her face down on his bosom. Her white night-dress
was smeared with blood, and a thin stream trickled down the
man's bare chest which was shown by his torn-open dress. The
attitude of the two had a terrible resemblance to a child
forcing a kitten's nose into a saucer of milk to compel it
to drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his
face, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed
to leap into it. His eyes flamed red with devilish passion.
The great nostrils of the white aquiline nose opened wide
and quivered at the edge, and the white sharp teeth, behind
the full lips of the blood dripping mouth, clamped together
like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, which threw his
victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he
turned and sprang at us. But by this time the Professor had
gained his feet, and was holding towards him the envelope
which contained the Sacred Wafer. The Count suddenly stopped,
just as poor Lucy had done outside the tomb, and cowered
back. Further and further back he cowered, as we, lifting
our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as
a great black cloud sailed across the sky. And when the
gaslight sprang up under Quincey's match, we saw nothing but
a faint vapor. This, as we looked, trailed under the door,
which with the recoil from its bursting open, had swung back
to its old position. Van Helsing, Art, and I moved forward
to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and
with it had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so des-
pairing that it seems to me now that it will ring in my ears
till my dying day. For a few seconds she lay in her helpless
attitude and disarray. Her face was ghastly, with a pallor
which was accentuated by the blood which smeared her lips
and cheeks and chin. From her throat trickled a thin stream
of blood. Her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before
her face her poor crushed hands, which bore on their white-
ness the red mark of the Count's terrible grip, and from
behind them came a low desolate wail which made the terrible
scream seem only the quick expression of an endless grief.
Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently
over her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an
instant despairingly, ran out of the room.

Van Helsing whispered to me, "Jonathan is in a stupor
such as we know the Vampire can produce. We can do nothing
with poor Madam Mina for a few moments till she recovers
herself. I must wake him!"

He dipped the end of a towel in cold water and with it
began to flick him on the face, his wife all the while hold-
ing her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was
heart breaking to hear. I raised the blind, and looked out
of the window. There was much moonshine, and as I looked I
could see Quincey Morris run across the lawn and hide him-
self in the shadow of a great yew tree. It puzzled me to
think why he was doing this. But at the instant I heard Har-
ker's quick exclamation as he woke to partial consciousness,
and turned to the bed. On his face, as there might well be,
was a look of wild amazement. He seemed dazed for a few se-
conds, and then full consciousness seemed to burst upon him
all at once, and he started up.

His wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned
to him with her arms stretched out, as though to embrace him.
Instantly, however, she drew them in again, and putting her
elbows together, held her hands before her face, and shuddered
till the bed beneath her shook.

"In God's name what does this mean?" Harker cried out.
"Dr. Seward, Dr. Van Helsing, what is it? What has happened?
What is wrong? Mina, dear what is it? What does that blood
mean? My God, my God! Has it come to this!" And, raising
himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildly together."Good
God help us! Help her! Oh, help her!"

With a quick movement he jumped from bed, and began to
pull on his clothes, all the man in him awake at the need for
instant exertion. "What has happened? Tell me all about it!"
he cried without pausing. "Dr. Van Helsing you love Mina, I
know. Oh, do something to save her. It cannot have gone too
far yet. Guard her while I look for him!"

His wife, through her terror and horror and distress,
saw some sure danger to him. Instantly forgetting her own
grief, she seized hold of him and cried out.

"No! No! Jonathan, you must not leave me. I have
suffered enough tonight, God knows, without the dread of his
harming you. You must stay with me. Stay with these friends
who will watch over you!" Her expression became frantic as
she spoke. And, he yielding to her, she pulled him down
sitting on the bedside, and clung to him fiercely.

Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both. The Professor
held up his golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calm-
ness, "Do not fear, my dear. We are here, and whilst this
is close to you no foul thing can approach. You are safe for
tonight, and we must be calm and take counsel together."

She shuddered and was silent, holding down her head on
her husband's breast. When she raised it, his white night-
robe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and
where the thin open wound in the neck had sent forth drops.
The instant she saw it she drew back, with a low wail, and
whispered, amidst choking sobs.

"Unclean, unclean! I must touch him or kiss him no more.
Oh, that it should be that it is I who am now his worst enemy,
and whom he may have most cause to fear."

To this he spoke out resolutely, "Nonsense, Mina. It is
a shame to me to hear such a word. I would not hear it of
you. And I shall not hear it from you. May God judge me by
my deserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering than
even this hour, if by any act or will of mine anything ever
come between us!"

He put out his arms and folded her to his breast. And
for a while she lay there sobbing. He looked at us over her
bowed head, with eyes that blinked damply above his quivering
nostrils. His mouth was set as steel.

After a while her sobs became less frequent and more
faint, and then he said to me, speaking with a studied calm-
ness which I felt tried his nervous power to the utmost.

"And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it. Too well
I know the broad fact. Tell me all that has been."

I told him exactly what had happened and he listened
with seeming impassiveness, but his nostrils twitched and
his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the
Count had held his wife in that terrible and horrid position,
with her mouth to the open wound in his breast. It interested
me, even at that moment, to see that whilst the face of white
set passion worked convulsively over the bowed head, the
hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled hair. Just
as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door.
They entered in obedience to our summons. Van Helsing looked
at me questioningly. I understood him to mean if we were to
take advantage of their coming to divert if possible the
thoughts of the unhappy husband and wife from each other and
from themselves. So on nodding acquiescence to him he asked
them what they had seen or done. To which Lord Godalming
answered.

"I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any
of our rooms. I looked in the study but, though he had been
there, he had gone. He had, however. . ." He stopped
suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on the bed.

Van Helsing said gravely, "Go on, friend Arthur. We
want here no more concealments. Our hope now is in knowing
all. Tell freely!"

So Art went on, "He had been there, and though it could
only have been for a few seconds, he made rare hay of the
place. All the manuscript had been burned, and the blue
flames were flickering amongst the white ashes. The cylin-
ders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the
wax had helped the flames."

Here I interrupted. "Thank God there is the other copy
in the safe!"

His face lit for a moment, but fell again as he went on.
"I ran downstairs then, but could see no sign of him. I
looked into Renfield's room, but there was no trace there
except. . ." Again he paused.

"Go on," said Harker hoarsely. So he bowed his head and
moistening his lips with his tongue, added, "except that the
poor fellow is dead."

Mrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one to the
other of us she said solemnly, "God's will be done!"

I could not but feel that Art was keeping back some-
thing. But, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said
nothing.

Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked, "And you, friend
Quincey, have you any to tell?"

"A little," he answered. "It may be much eventually,
but at present I can't say. I thought it well to know if
possible where the Count would go when he left the house. I
did not see him, but I saw a bat rise from Renfield's window,
and flap westward. I expected to see him in some shape go
back to Carfax, but he evidently sought some other lair. He
will not be back tonight, for the sky is reddening in the
east, and the dawn is close. We must work tomorrow!"

He said the latter words through his shut teeth. For a
space of perhaps a couple of minutes there was silence, and I
could fancy that I could hear the sound of our hearts beat-
ing.

Then Van Helsing said, placing his hand tenderly on Mrs.
Harker's head, "And now, Madam Mina, poor dear, dear, Madam
Mina, tell us exactly what happened. God knows that I do not
want that you be pained, but it is need that we know all. For
now more than ever has all work to be done quick and sharp,
and in deadly earnest. The day is close to us that must end
all, if it may be so, and now is the chance that we may live
and learn."

The poor dear lady shivered, and I could see the ten-
sion of her nerves as she clasped her husband closer to her
and bent her head lower and lower still on his breast. Then
she raised her head proudly, and held out one hand to Van
Helsing who took it in his, and after stooping and kissing it
reverently, held it fast. The other hand was locked in that
of her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her pro-
tectingly. After a pause in which she was evidently ordering
her thoughts, she began.

"I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly
given me, but for a long time it did not act. I seemed to
become more wakeful, and myriads of horrible fancies began
to crowd in upon my mind. All of them connected with death,
and vampires, with blood, and pain, and trouble." Her hus-
band involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said
lovingly, "Do not fret, dear. You must be brave and strong,
and help me through the horrible task. If you only knew what
an effort it is to me to tell of this fearful thing at all,
you would understand how much I need your help. Well, I saw
I must try to help the medicine to its work with my will, if
it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself to sleep.
Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember
no more. Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by
my side when next I remember. There was in the room the same
thin white mist that I had before noticed. But I forget now
if you know of this. You will find it in my diary which I
shall show you later. I felt the same vague terror which had
come to me before and the same sense of some presence. I
turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly
that it seemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping
draught, and not I. I tried, but I could not wake him. This
caused me a great fear, and I looked around terrified. Then
indeed, my heart sank within me. Beside the bed, as if he
had stepped out of the mist, or rather as if the mist had
turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared,
stood a tall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once
from the description of the others. The waxen face, the
high aquiline nose, on which the light fell in a thin white
line, the parted red lips, with the sharp white teeth show-
ing between, and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in
the sunset on the windows of St. Mary's Church at Witby. I
knew, too, the red scar on his forehead where Jonathan had
struck him. For an instant my heart stood still, and I would
have screamed out, only that I was paralyzed. In the pause
he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper, pointing as he
spoke to Jonathan.

"`Silence! If you make a sound I shall take him and
dash his brains out before your very eyes.' I was appalled
and was too bewildered to do or say anything. With a mocking
smile, he placed one hand upon my shoulder and, holding me
tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he did so,
`First, a little refreshment to reward my exertions. You may
as well be quiet. It is not the first time, or the second,
that your veins have appeased my thirst!' I was bewildered,
and strangely enough, I did not want to hinder him. I suppose
it is a part of the horrible curse that such is, when his
touch is on his victim. And oh, my God, my God, pity me! He
placed his reeking lips upon my throat!" Her husband groaned
again. She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pity-
ingly, as if he were the injured one, and went on.

"I felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half
swoon. How long this horrible thing lasted I know not, but
it seemed that a long time must have passed before he took
his foul, awful, sneering mouth away. I saw it drip with the
fresh blood!"The remembrance seemed for a while to overpower
her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her
husband's sustaining arm. With a great effort she recovered
herself and went on.

"Then he spoke to me mockingly, `And so you, like the
others, would play your brains against mine. You would help
these men to hunt me and frustrate me in my design! You know
now, and they know in part already, and will know in full
before long, what it is to cross my path. They should have
kept their energies for use closer to home. Whilst they play-
ed wits against me, against me who commanded nations, and
intrigued for them, and fought for them, hundreds of years
before they were born, I was countermining them. And you,
their best beloved one, are now to me, flesh of my flesh,
blood of my blood, kin of my kin, my bountiful wine-press
for a while, and shall be later on my companion and my
helper. You shall be avenged in turn, for not one of them
but shall minister to your needs. But as yet you are to be
punished for what you have done. You have aided in thwarting
me. Now you shall come to my call. When my brain says "Come!"
to you, you shall cross land or sea to do my bidding. And to
that end this!'

With that he pulled open his shirt, and with his long
sharp nails opened a vein in his breast. When the blood
began to spurt out, he took my hands in one of his, holding
them tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my
mouth to the wound, so that I must either suffocate or
swallow some to the. . .Oh, my God! My God! What have I
done? What have I done to deserve such a fate, I who have
tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my days. God
pity me! Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril.
And in mercy pity those to whom she is dear!" Then she began
to rub her lips as though to cleanse them from pollution.

As she was telling her terrible story, the eastern sky
began to quicken, and everything became more and more clear.
Harker was still and quiet. But over his face, as the awful
narrative went on, came a grey look which deepened and deep-
ened in the morning light, till when the first red streak of
the coming dawn shot up, the flesh stood darkly out against
the whitening hair.

We have arranged that one of us is to stay within call
of the unhappy pair till we can meet together and arrange
about taking action.

Of this I am sure. The sun rises today on no more
miserable house in all the great round of its daily course.





CHAPTER 22


JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


3 October.--As I must do something or go mad, I write
this diary. It is now six o'clock, and we are to meet in
the study in half an hour and take something to eat, for Dr.
Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are agreed that if we do not eat
we cannot work our best. Our best will be, God knows, required
today. I must keep writing at every chance, for I dare not
stop to think. All, big and little, must go down. Perhaps at
the end the little things may teach us most. The teaching, big
or little, could not have landed Mina or me anywhere worse
than we are today. However, we must trust and hope. Poor
Mina told me just now, with the tears running down her dear
cheeks, that it is in trouble and trial that our faith is
tested. That we must keep on trusting, and that God will aid
us up to the end. The end! Oh my God! What end?. . .
To work! To work!

When Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from
seeing poor Renfield, we went gravely into what was to be
done. First, Dr. Seward told us that when he and Dr. Van
Helsing had gone down to the room below they had found Ren-
field lying on the floor, all in a heap. His face was
all bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were
broken.

Dr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the
passage if he had heard anything. He said that he had been
sitting down, he confessed to half dozing, when he heard
loud voices in the room, and then Renfield had called out
loudly several times, "God! God! God!" After that there
was a sound of falling, and when he entered the room he
found him lying on the floor, face down, just as the doctors
had seen him. Van Helsing asked if he had heard "voices" or
"a voice," and he said he could not say. That at first it
had seemed to him as if there were two, but as there was no
one in the room it could have been only one. He could swear
to it, if required, that the word "God" was spoken by the
patient.

Dr. Seward said to us, when we were alone, that he did
not wish to go into the matter. The question of an inquest
had to be considered, and it would never do to put forward
the truth, as no one would believe it. As it was, he thought
that on the attendant's evidence he could give a certificate
of death by misadventure in falling from bed. In case the
coroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest,
necessarily to the same result.

When the question began to be discussed as to what
should be our next step, the very first thing we decided was
that Mina should be in full confidence. That nothing of any
sort, no matter how painful, should be kept from her. She
herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful to see
her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such a depth of
despair.

"There must be no concealment," she said. "Alas! We
have had too much already. And besides there is nothing in
all the world that can give me more pain than I have already
endured, than I suffer now! Whatever may happen, it must be
of new hope or of new courage to me!"

Van Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke,
and said, suddenly but quietly, "But dear Madam Mina, are
you not afraid. Not for yourself, but for others from your-
self, after what has happened?"

Her face grew set in its lines, but her eyes shone with
the devotion of a martyr as she answered, "Ah no! For my
mind is made up!"

"To what?" he asked gently, whilst we were all very
still, for each in our own way we had a sort of vague idea
of what she meant.

Her answer came with direct simplicity, as though she
was simply stating a fact, "Because if I find in myself,
and I shall watch keenly for it, a sign of harm to any that
I love, I shall die!"

"You would not kill yourself?" he asked, hoarsely.

"I would. If there were no friend who loved me, who
would save me such a pain, and so desperate an effort!" She
looked at him meaningly as she spoke.

He was sitting down, but now he rose and came close to
her and put his hand on her head as he said solemnly. "My
child, there is such an one if it were for your good. For
myself I could hold it in my account with God to find such
an euthanasia for you, even at this moment if it were best.
Nay, were it safe! But my child. . ."

For a moment he seemed choked, and a great sob rose in
his throat. He gulped it down and went on, "There are here
some who would stand between you and death. You must not
die. You must not die by any hand, but least of all your
own. Until the other, who has fouled your sweet life, is
true dead you must not die. For if he is still with the
quick Undead, your death would make you even as he is. No,
you must live! You must struggle and strive to live, though
death would seem a boon unspeakable. You must fight Death
himself, though he come to you in pain or in joy. By the
day, or the night, in safety or in peril! On your living
soul I charge you that you do not die. Nay, nor think of
death, till this great evil be past."

The poor dear grew white as death, and shook and shiv-
ered, as I have seen a quicksand shake and shiver at the
incoming of the tide. We were all silent. We could do
nothing. At length she grew more calm and turning to him
said sweetly, but oh so sorrowfully, as she held out her
hand, "I promise you, my dear friend, that if God will let
me live, I shall strive to do so. Till, if it may be in His
good time, this horror may have passed away from me."

She was so good and brave that we all felt that our
hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her, and we
began to discuss what we were to do. I told her that she
was to have all the papers in the safe, and all the papers
or diaries and phonographs we might hereafter use, and was
to keep the record as she had done before. She was pleased
with the prospect of anything to do, if "pleased" could be
used in connection with so grim an interest.

As usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else,
and was prepared with an exact ordering of our work.

"It is perhaps well," he said, "that at our meeting
after our visit to Carfax we decided not to do anything with
the earth boxes that lay there. Had we done so, the Count
must have guessed our purpose, and would doubtless have
taken measures in advance to frustrate such an effort with
regard to the others. But now he does not know our inten-
tions. Nay, more, in all probability, he does not know that
such a power exists to us as can sterilize his lairs, so
that he cannot use them as of old.

"We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge
as to their disposition that, when we have examined the
house in Piccadilly, we may track the very last of them. Today
then, is ours, and in it rests our hope. The sun that rose
on our sorrow this morning guards us in its course. Until it
sets tonight, that monster must retain whatever form he now
has. He is confined within the limitations of his earthly
envelope. He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear through
cracks or chinks or crannies. If he go through a doorway, he
must open the door like a mortal. And so we have this day to
hunt out all his lairs and sterilize them. So we shall, if
we have not yet catch him and destroy him, drive him to bay
in some place where the catching and the destroying shall be,
in time, sure."

Here I started up for I could not contain myself at the
thought that the minutes and seconds so preciously laden
with Mina's life and happiness were flying from us, since
whilst we talked action was impossible. But Van Helsing held
up his hand warningly.

"Nay, friend Jonathan," he said, "in this, the quickest
way home is the longest way, so your proverb say. We shall
all act and act with desperate quick, when the time has come.
But think, in all probable the key of the situation is in
that house in Piccadilly. The Count may have many houses
which he has bought. Of them he will have deeds of purchase,
keys and other things. He will have paper that he write on.
He will have his book of cheques. There are many belongings
that he must have somewhere. Why not in this place so cen-
tral, so quiet, where he come and go by the front or the back
at all hours, when in the very vast of the traffic there is
none to notice. We shall go there and search that house. And
when we learn what it holds, then we do what our friend Art-
hur call, in his phrases of hunt `stop the earths' and so we
run down our old fox, so? Is it not?"

"Then let us come at once," I cried, "we are wasting
the precious, precious time!"

The Professor did not move, but simply said, "And how
are we to get into that house in Piccadilly?"

"Any way!" I cried. "We shall break in if need be."

"And your police? Where will they be, and what will
they say?"

I was staggered, but I knew that if he wished to delay
he had a good reason for it. So I said, as quietly as I
could, "Don't wait more than need be. You know, I am sure,
what torture I am in."

"Ah, my child, that I do. And indeed there is no wish
of me to add to your anguish. But just think, what can we
do, until all the world be at movement. Then will come our
time. I have thought and thought, and it seems to me that
the simplest way is the best of all. Now we wish to get
into the house, but we have no key. Is it not so?" I nodded.

"Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that
house, and could not still get in. And think there was to
you no conscience of the housebreaker, what would you do?"

"I should get a respectable locksmith, and set him to
work to pick the lock for me."

"And your police, they would interfere, would they not?"

"Oh no! Not if they knew the man was properly employed."

"Then," he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, "all
that is in doubt is the conscience of the employer, and the
belief of your policemen as to whether or not that employer
has a good conscience or a bad one. Your police must indeed
be zealous men and clever, oh so clever, in reading the
heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter. No, no,
my friend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty
houses in this your London, or of any city in the world, and
if you do it as such things are rightly done, and at the time
such things are rightly done, no one will interfere. I have
read of a gentleman who owned a so fine house in London, and
when he went for months of summer to Switzerland and lock up
his house, some burglar come and broke window at back and
got in. Then he went and made open the shutters in front and
walk out and in through the door, before the very eyes of the
police. Then he have an auction in that house, and advertise
it, and put up big notice. And when the day come he sell off
by a great auctioneer all the goods of that other man who
own them. Then he go to a builder, and he sell him that
house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take all
away within a certain time. And your police and other
authority help him all they can. And when that owner come
back from his holiday in Switzerland he find only an empty
hole where his house had been. This was all done en regle,
and in our work we shall be en regle too. We shall not go so
early that the policemen who have then little to think of,
shall deem it strange. But we shall go after ten o'clock,
when there are many about, and such things would be done were
we indeed owners of the house."

I could not but see how right he was and the terrible
despair of Mina's face became relaxed in thought. There was
hope in such good counsel.

Van Helsing went on, "When once within that house we
may find more clues. At any rate some of us can remain
there whilst the rest find the other places where there be
more earth boxes, at Bermondsey and Mile End."

Lord Godalming stood up. "I can be of some use here,"
he said. "I shall wire to my people to have horses and
carriages where they will be most convenient."

"Look here, old fellow," said Morris, "it is a capital
idea to have all ready in case we want to go horse backing,
but don't you think that one of your snappy carriages with
its heraldic adornments in a byway of Walworth or Mile End
would attract too much attention for our purpose? It seems
to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east.
And even leave them somewhere near the neighborhood we are
going to."

"Friend Quincey is right!" said the Professor. "His
head is what you call in plane with the horizon. It is a
difficult thing that we go to do, and we do not want no
peoples to watch us if so it may."

Mina took a growing interest in everything and I was
rejoiced to see that the exigency of affairs was helping
her to forget for a time the terrible experience of the
night. She was very, very pale, almost ghastly, and so thin
that her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth in somewhat
of prominence. I did not mention this last, lest it should
give her needless pain, but it made my blood run cold in my
veins to think of what had occurred with poor Lucy when the
Count had sucked her blood. As yet there was no sign of the
teeth growing sharper, but the time as yet was short, and
there was time for fear.

When we came to the discussion of the sequence of our
efforts and of the disposition of our forces, there were new
sources of doubt. It was finally agreed that before starting
for Piccadilly we should destroy the Count's lair close at
hand. In case he should find it out too soon, we should thus
be still ahead of him in our work of destruction. And his
presence in his purely material shape, and at his weakest,
might give us some new clue.

A s to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the
Professor that, after our visit to Carfax, we should all
enter the house in Piccadilly. That the two doctors and I
should remain there, whilst Lord Godalming and Quincey found
the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them. It was
possible, if not likely, the Professor urged, that the Count
might appear in Piccadilly during the day, and that if so we
might be able to cope with him then and there. At any rate,
we might be able to follow him in force. To this plan I
strenuously objected, and so far as my going was concerned,
for I said that I intended to stay and protect Mina. I
thought that my mind was made up on the subject, but Mina
would not listen to my objection. She said that there might
be some law matter in which I could be useful. That amongst
the Count's papers might be some clue which I could under-
stand out of my experience in Transylvania. And that, as it
was, all the strength we could muster was required to cope
with the Count's extraordinary power. I had to give in, for
Mina's resolution was fixed. She said that it was the last
hope for her that we should all work together.

"As for me," she said, "I have no fear. Things have
been as bad as they can be. And whatever may happen must
have in it some element of hope or comfort. Go, my husband!
God can, if He wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any
one present."

So I started up crying out, "Then in God's name let us
come at once, for we are losing time. The Count may come to
Piccadilly earlier than we think."

"Not so!" said Van Helsing, holding up his hand.

"But why?" I asked.

"Do you forget," he said, with actually a smile, "that
last night he banqueted heavily, and will sleep late?"

Did I forget! Shall I ever. . .can I ever! Can any
of us ever forget that terrible scene! Mina struggled hard
to keep her brave countenance, but the pain overmastered her
and she put her hands before her face, and shuddered whilst
she moaned. Van Helsing had not intended to recall her
frightful experience. He had simply lost sight of her and
her part in the affair in his intellectual effort.

When it struck him what he said, he was horrified at his
thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her.

"Oh, Madam Mina," he said, "dear, dear, Madam Mina, alas!
That I of all who so reverence you should have said anything
so forgetful. These stupid old lips of mine and this stupid
old head do not deserve so, but you will forget it, will you
not?" He bent low beside her as he spoke.

She took his hand, and looking at him through her tears,
said hoarsely, "No, I shall not forget, for it is well that
I remember. And with it I have so much in memory of you that
is sweet, that I take it all together. Now, you must all be
going soon. Breakfast is ready, and we must all eat that we
may be strong."

Breakfast was a strange meal to us all. We tried to be
cheerful and encourage each other, and Mina was the brightest
and most cheerful of us. When it was over, Van Helsing stood
up and said, "Now, my dear friends, we go forth to our terr-
ible enterprise. Are we all armed, as we were on that night
when first we visited our enemy's lair.  Armed against ghostly
as well as carnal attack?"

We all assured him.

"Then it is well. Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case
quite safe here until the sunset. And before then we shall
return. . .if. . .We shall return! But before we go let
me see you armed against personal attack. I have myself, since
you came down, prepared your chamber by the placing of things
of which we know, so that He may not enter. Now let me guard
yourself. On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer
in the name of the Father, the Son, and. . .

There was a fearful scream which almost froze our
hearts to hear. As he had placed the Wafer on Mina's fore-
head, it had seared it. . .had burned into the flesh as
though it had been a piece of whitehot metal. My poor darl-
ing's brain had told her the significance of the fact as
quickly as her nerves received the pain of it, and the two so
overwhelmed her that her overwrought nature had its voice in
that dreadful scream.

But the words to her thought came quickly. The echo of
the scream had not ceased to ring on the air when there came
the reaction, and she sank on her knees on the floor in an
agony of abasement. Pulling her beautiful hair over her face,
as the leper of old his mantle, she wailed out.

"Unclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my polluted
flesh! I must bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until
the Judgement Day."

They all paused. I had thrown myself beside her in an
agony of helpless grief, and putting my arms around held her
tight. For a few minutes our sorrowful hearts beat together,
whilst the friends around us turned away their eyes that ran
tears silently. Then Van Helsing turned and said gravely. So
gravely that I could not help feeling that he was in some
way inspired, and was stating things outside himself.

"It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God
himself see fit, as He most surely shall, on the Judgement
Day, to redress all wrongs of the earth and of His children
that He has placed thereon. And oh, Madam Mina, my dear, my
dear, may we who love you be there to see, when that red scar,
the sign of God's knowledge of what has been, shall pass away,
and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know. For so
surely as we live, that scar shall pass away when God sees
right to lift the burden that is hard upon us. Till then we
bear our Cross, as His Son did in obedience to His Will. It
may be that we are chosen instruments of His good pleasure,
and that we ascend to His bidding as that other through
stripes and shame. Through tears and blood. Through doubts
and fear, and all that makes the difference between God and
man."

There was hope in his words, and comfort. And they
made for resignation. Mina and I both felt so, and simul-
taneously we each took one of the old man's hands and bent
over and kissed it. Then without a word we all knelt down
together, and all holding hands, swore to be true to each
other. We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow
from the head of her whom, each in his own way, we loved.  And
we prayed for help and guidance in the terrible task which
lay before us. It was then time to start. So I said farewell
to Mina, a parting which neither of us shall forget to our
dying day, and we set out.

To one thing I have made up my mind. If we find out
that Mina must be a vampire in the end, then she shall not
go into that unknown and terrible land alone. I suppose it
is thus that in old times one vampire meant many. Just as
their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so the
holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly
ranks.

We entered Carfax without trouble and found all things
the same as on the first occasion. It was hard to believe
that amongst so prosaic surroundings of neglect and dust and
decay there was any ground for such fear as already we knew.
Had not our minds been made up, and had there not been terr-
ible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have proceeded
with our task. We found no papers, or any sign of use in the
house. And in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as
we had seen them last.

Dr. Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before
him, "And now, my friends, we have a duty here to do. We
must sterilize this earth, so sacred of holy memories, that
he has brought from a far distant land for such fell use. He
has chosen this earth because it has been holy. Thus we de-
feat him with his own weapon, for we make it more holy still.
It was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it to
God."

As he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a
wrench, and very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown
open. The earth smelled musty and close, but we did not some-
how seem to mind, for our attention was concentrated on the
Professor. Taking from his box a piece of the Scared Wafer
he laid it reverently on the earth, and then shutting down
the lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked.

One by one we treated in the same way each of the great
boxes, and left them as we had found them to all appearance.
But in each was a portion of the Host. When we closed the
door behind us, the Professor said solemnly, "So much is
already done. It may be that with all the others we can be
so successful, then the sunset of this evening may shine of
Madam Mina's forehead all white as ivory and with no stain!"

As we passed across the lawn on our way to the station
to catch our train we could see the front of the asylum. I
looked eagerly, and in the window of my own room saw Mina.
I waved my hand to her, and nodded to tell that our work
there was successfully accomplished. She nodded in reply to
show that she understood. The last I saw, she was waving her
hand in farewell. It was with a heavy heart that we sought
the station and just caught the train, which was steaming in
as we reached the platform. I have written this in the train.


Piccadilly, 12:30 o'clock.--Just before we reached
Fenchurch Street Lord Godalming said to me, "Quincey and I
will find a locksmith. You had better not come with us in
case there should be any difficulty. For under the circum-
stances it wouldn't seem so bad for us to break into an
empty house. But you are a solicitor and the Incorporated
Law Society might tell you that you should have known
better."

I demurred as to my not sharing any danger even of
odium, but he went on, "Besides, it will attract less atten-
tion if there are not too many of us. My title will make it
all right with the locksmith, and with any policeman that may
come along. You had better go with Jack and the Professor and
stay in the Green Park. Somewhere in sight of the house, and
when you see the door opened and the smith has gone away, do
you all come across. We shall be on the lookout for you, and
shall let you in."

"The advice is good!" said Van Helsing, so we said no
more. Godalming and Morris hurried off in a cab, we following
in another. At the corner of Arlington Street our contingent
got out and strolled into the Green Park. My heart beat as I
saw the house on which so much of our hope was centered, loom-
ing up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst its
more lively and spruce-looking neighbors. We sat down on a
bench within good view , and began to smoke cigars so as to
attract as little attention as possible. The minutes seemed
to pass with leaden feet as we waited for the coming of the
others.

At length we saw a four-wheeler drive up. Out of it,
in leisurely fashion, got Lord Godalming and Morris. And
down from the box descended a thick-set working man with his
rush-woven basket of tools. Morris paid the cabman, who
touched his hat and drove away. Together the two ascended
the steps, and Lord Godalming pointed out what he wanted done.
The workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one
of the spikes of the rail, saying something to a policeman
who just then sauntered along. The policeman nodded acqui-
escence, and the man kneeling down placed his bag beside him.
After searching through it, he took out a selection of tools
which he proceeded to lay beside him in orderly fashion. Then
he stood up, looked in the keyhole, blew into it, and turning
to his employers, made some remark. Lord Godalming smiled,
and the man lifted a good sized bunch of keys. Selecting
one of them, he began to probe the lock, as if feeling his
way with it. After fumbling about for a bit he tried a se-
cond, and then a third. All at once the door opened under a
slight push from him, and he and the two others entered the
hall. We sat still. My own cigar burnt furiously, but Van
Helsing's went cold altogether. We waited patiently as we
saw the workman come out and bring his bag. Then he held the
door partly open, steadying it with his knees, whilst he
fitted a key to the lock. This he finally handed to Lord
Godalming, who took out his purse and gave him something. The
man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his coat and de-
parted. Not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole
transaction.

When the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the
street and knocked at the door. It was immediately opened
by Quincey Morris, beside whom stood Lord Godalming lighting
a cigar.

"The place smells so vilely," said the latter as we
came in. It did indeed smell vilely. Like the old chapel at
Carfax. And with our previous experience it was plain to us
that the Count had been using the place pretty freely. We
moved to explore the house, all keeping together in case of
attack, for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal
with, and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not
be in the house.

In the dining room, which lay at the back of the hall,
we found eight boxes of earth. Eight boxes only out of the
nine which we sought! Our work was not over, and would never
be until we should have found the missing box.

First we opened the shutters of the window which looked
out across a narrow stone flagged yard at the blank face of
a stable, pointed to look like the front of a miniature
house. There were no windows in it, so we were not afraid
of being overlooked. We did not lose any time in examining
the chests. With the tools which we had brought with us we
opened them, one by one, and treated them as we had treated
those others in the old chapel. It was evident to us that
the Count was not at present in the house, and we proceeded
to search for any of his effects.

After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from
basement to attic, we came to the conclusion that the dining
room contained any effects which might belong to the Count.
And so we proceeded to minutely examine them. They lay in a
sort of orderly disorder on the great dining room table.

There were title deeds of the Piccadilly house in a
great bundle, deeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile
End and Bermondsey, notepaper, envelopes, and pens and ink.
All were covered up in thin wrapping paper to keep them from
the dust. There were also a clothes brush, a brush and comb,
and a jug and basin. The latter containing dirty water which
was reddened as if with blood. Last of all was a little heap
of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to
the other houses.

When we had examined this last find, Lord Godalming and
Quincey Morris taking accurate notes of the various add-
resses of the houses in the East and the South, took with
them the keys in a great bunch, and set out to destroy the
boxes in these places. The rest of us are, with what patience
we can, waiting their return, or the coming of the Count.





CHAPTER 23


DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


3 October.--The time seemed teribly long whilst we were
waiting for the coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris. The
Professor tried to keep our minds active by using them all
the time. I could see his beneficent purpose, by the side
glances which he threw from time to time at Harker. The
poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to
see. Last night he was a frank, happy-looking man, with
strong, youthful face, full of energy, and with dark brown
hair. Today he is a drawn, haggard old man, whose white
hair matches well with the hollow burning eyes and grief-
written lines of his face. His energy is still intact. In
fact, he is like a living flame. This may yet be his sal-
vation, for if all go well, it will tide him over the des-
pairing period. He will then, in a kind of way, wake again
to the realities o f life. Poor fellow, I thought my own
trouble was bad enough, but his. . .!

The Professor knows this well enough, and is doing his
best to keep his mind active. What he has been saying was,
under the circumstances, of absorbing interest. So well as
I can remember, here it is:

"I have studied, over and over again since they came
into my hands, all the papers relating to this monster, and
the more I have studied, the greater seems the necessity to
utterly stamp him out. All through there are signs of his
advance. Not only of his power, but of his knowledge of it.
As I learned from the researches of my friend Arminius of
Buda-Pesth, he was in life a most wonderful man. Soldier,
statesman, and alchemist. Which latter was the highest
development of the science knowledge of his time. He had a
mighty brain, a learning beyond compare, and a heart that
knew no fear and no remorse. He dared even to attend the
Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his
time that he did not essay.

"Well, in him the brain powers survived the physical
death. Though it would seem that memory was not all complete.
In some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child.
But he is growing, and some things that were childish at the
first are now of man's stature. He is experimenting, and
doing it well. And if it had not been that we have crossed
his path he would be yet, he may be yet if we fail, the
father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must
lead through Death, not Life."

Harker groaned and said, "And this is all arrayed
against my darling! But how is he experimenting? The know-
ledge may help us to defeat him!"

"He has all along, since his coming, been trying his
power, slowly but surely. That big child-brain of his is
working. Well for us, it is as yet, a child-brain. For had
he dared, at the first, to attempt certain things he would
long ago have been beyond our power. However, he means to
succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can afford
to wait and to go slow. Festina lente may well be his motto."

"I fail to understand," said Harker wearily. "Oh, do
be more plain to me! Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling
my brain."

The Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as
he spoke, "Ah, my child, I will be plain. Do you not see
how, of late, this monster has been creeping into knowledge
experimentally. How he has been making use of the zoophagous
patient to effect his entry into friend John's home. For your
Vampire, though in all afterwards he can come when and how he
will, must at the first make entry only when asked thereto
by an inmate. But these are not his most important experi-
ments. Do we not see how at the first all these so great
boxes were moved by others. He knew not then but that must
be so. But all the time that so great child-brain of his was
growing, and he began to consider whether he might not him-
self move the box. So he began to help. And then, when he
found that this be all right, he try to move them all alone.
And so he progress, and he scatter these graves of him. And
none but he know where they are hidden.

"He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground. So
that only he use them in the night, or at such time as he
can change his form, they do him equal well, and none may
know these are his hiding place! But, my child, do not des-
pair, this knowledge came to him just too late! Already all
of his lairs but one be sterilize as for him. And before the
sunset this shall be so. Then he have no place where he can
move and hide. I delayed this morning that so we might be
sure. Is there not more at stake for us than for him? Then
why not be more careful than him? By my clock it is one hour
and already, if all be well, friend Arthur and Quincey are on
their way to us. Today is our day, and we must go sure, if
slow, and lose no chance. See! There are five of us when
those absent ones return."

Whilst we were speaking we were startled by a knock at
the hall door, the double postman's knock of the telegraph
boy. We all moved out to the hall with one impulse, and Van
Helsing, holding up his hand to us to keep silence, stepped
to the door and opened it. The boy handed in a dispatch.
The Professor closed the door again, and after looking at the
direction, opened it and read aloud.

"Look out for D. He has just now, 12:45, come from
Carfax hurriedly and hastened towards the South. He seems to
be going the round and may want to see you: Mina."

There was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker's voice,
"Now, God be thanked, we shall soon meet!"

Van Helsing turned to him quickly and said, "God will
act in His own way and time. Do not fear, and do not rejoice
as yet. For what we wish for at the moment may be our own
undoings."

"I care for nothing now," he answered hotly, "except to
wipe out this brute from the face of creation. I would sell
my soul to do it!"

"Oh, hush, hush, my child!" said Van Helsing. "God does
not purchase souls in this wise, and the Devil, though he may
purchase, does not keep faith. But God is merciful and just,
and knows your pain and your devotion to that dear Madam
Mina. Think you, how her pain would be doubled, did she but
hear your wild words. Do not fear any of us, we are all de-
voted to this cause, and today shall see the end. The time
is coming for action. Today this Vampire is limit to the
powers of man, and till sunset he may not change. It will
take him time to arrive here, see it is twenty minutes past
one, and there are yet some times before he can hither come,
be he never so quick. What we must hope for is that my Lord
Arthur and Quincey arrive first."

About half an hour after we had received Mrs. Harker's
telegram, there came a quiet, resolute knock at the hall
door. It was just an ordinary knock, such as is given hourly
by thousands of gentlemen, but it made the Professor's heart
and mine beat loudly. We looked at each other, and together
moved out into the hall. We each held ready to use our var-
ious armaments, the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal
in the right. Van Helsing pulled back the latch, and holding
the door half open, stood back, having both hands ready for
action. The gladness of our hearts must have shown upon our
faces when on the step, close to the door, we saw Lord Godal-
ming and Quincey Morris. They came quickly in and closed the
door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along the
hall.

"It is all right. We found both places. Six boxes in
each and we destroyed them all."

"Destroyed?" asked the Professor.

"For him!" We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey
said, "There's nothing to do but to wait here. If, however,
he doesn't turn up by five o'clock, we must start off. For
it won't do to leave Mrs. Harker alone after sunset."

"He will be here before long now,' said Van Helsing,
who had been consulting his pocketbook. "Nota bene, in
Madam's telegram he went south from Carfax. That means he
went to cross the river, and he could only do so at slack of
tide, which should be something before one o'clock. That he
went south has a meaning for us. He is as yet only suspi-
cious, and he went from Carfax first to the place where he
would suspect interference least. You must have been at Ber-
mondsey only a short time before him. That he is not here
already shows that he went to Mile End next. This took him
some time, for he would then have to be carried over the
river in some way. Believe me, my friends, we shall not have
long to wait now. We should have ready some plan of attack,
so that we may throw away no chance. Hush, there is no time
now. Have all your arms! Be ready!" He held up a warning
hand as he spoke, for we all could hear a key softly inserted
in the lock of the hall door.

I could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way
in which a dominant spirit asserted itself. In all our hunt-
ing parties and adventures in different parts of the world,
Quincey Morris had always been the one to arrange the plan
of action, and Arthur and I had been accustomed to obey him
implicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to be renewed instinc-
tively. With a swift glance around the room, he at once laid
out our plan of attack, and without speaking a word, with a
gesture, placed us each in position. Van Helsing, Harker,
and I were just behind the door, so that when it was opened
the Professor could guard it whilst we two stepped between
the incomer and the door. Godalming behind and Quincey in
front stood just out of sight ready to move in front of the
window. We waited in a suspense that made the seconds pass
with nightmare slowness. The slow, careful steps came along
the hall. The Count was evidently prepared for some surprise,
at least he feared it.

Suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room.
Winning a way past us before any of us could raise a hand
to stay him. There was something so pantherlike in the
movement, something so unhuman, that it seemed to sober us
all from the shock of his coming. The first to act was Hark-
er, who with a quick movement, threw himself before the door
leading into the room in the front of the house. As the
Count saw us, a horrible sort of snarl passed over his face,
showing the eyeteeth long and pointed. But the evil smile
as quickly passed into a cold stare of lion-like disdain.
His expression again changed as, with a single impulse, we
all advanced upon him. It was a pity that we had not some
better organized plan of attack, for even at the moment I
wondered what we were to do. I did not myself know whether
our lethal weapons would avail us anything.

Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for he had
ready his great Kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden
cut at him. The blow was a powerful one. Only the diabol-
ical quickness of the Count's leap back saved him. A second
less and the trenchant blade had shorn through his coat,
making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank notes and a
stream of gold fell out. The expression of the Count's face
was so hellish, that for a moment I feared for Harker, though
I saw him throw the terrible knife aloft again for another
stroke. Instinctively I moved forward with a protective
impulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand. I
felt a mighty power fly along my arm, and it was without
surprise that I saw the monster cower back before a similar
movement made spontaneously by each one of us. It would be
impossible to describe the expression of hate and baffled
malignity, of anger and hellish rage, which came over the
Count's face. His waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the
contrast of his burning eyes, and the red scar on the fore-
head showed on the pallid skin like a palpitating wound. The
next instant, with a sinuous dive he swept under Harker's
arm, ere his blow could fall, and grasping a handful of the
money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw himself
at the window. Amid the crash and glitter of the falling
glass, he tumbled into the flagged area below. Through the
sound of the shivering glass I could hear the "ting" of the
gold, as some of the sovereigns fell on the flagging.

We ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground.
He, rushing up the steps, crossed the flagged yard, and
pushed open the stable door. There he turned and spoke to
us.

"You think to baffle me, you with your pale faces all
in a row, like sheep in a butcher's. You shall be sorry
yet, each one of you! You think you have left me without a
place to rest, but I have more. My revenge is just begun!
I spread it over centuries, and time is on my side. Your
girls that you all love are mine already. And through them
you and others shall yet be mine, my creatures, to do my
bidding and to be my jackals when I want to feed. Bah!"

With a contemptuous sneer, he passed quickly through
the door, and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he fastened
it behind him. A door beyond opened and shut. The first of
us to speak was the Professor. Realizing the difficulty of
following him through the stable, we moved toward the hall.

"We have learnt something. . .much! Notwithstanding
his brave words, he fears us. He fears time, he fears want!
For if not, why he hurry so? His very tone betray him, or
my ears deceive. Why take that money? You follow quick.
You are hunters of the wild beast, and understand it so.
For me, I make sure that nothing here may be of use to him,
if so that he returns."

As he spoke he put the money remaining in his pocket,
took the title deeds in the bundle as Harker had left them,
and swept the remaining things into the open fireplace,
where he set fire to them with a match.

Godalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and
Harker had lowered himself from the window to follow the
Count. He had, however, bolted the stable door, and by the
time they had forced it open there was no sign of him. Van
Helsing and I tried to make inquiry at the back of the house.
But the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart.

It was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far
off. We had to recognize that our game was up. With heavy
hearts we agreed with the Professor when he said, "Let us go
back to Madam Mina. Poor, poor dear Madam Mina. All we can
do just now is done, and we can there, at least, protect her.
But we need not despair. There is but one more earth box, and
we must try to find it. When that is done all may yet be well."

I could see that he spoke as bravely as he could to com-
fort Harker. The poor fellow was quite broken down, now and
again he gave a low groan which he could not suppress. He was
thinking of his wife.

With sad hearts we came back to my house, where we
found Mrs. Harker waiting us, with an appearance of cheerful-
ness which did honor to her bravery and unselfishness. When
she saw our faces, her own became as pale as death. For a
second or two her eyes were closed as if she were in secret
prayer.

And then she said cheerfully, "I can never thank you
all enough. Oh, my poor darling!"

As she spoke, she took her husband's grey head in her
hands and kissed it.

"Lay your poor head here and rest it. All will yet be
well, dear! God will protect us if He so will it in His
good intent." The poor fellow groaned. There was no place
for words in his sublime misery.

We had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and I
think it cheered us all up somewhat. It was, perhaps, the
mere animal heat of food to hungry people, for none of us
had eaten anything since breakfast, or the sense of companion-
ship may have helped us, but anyhow we were all less
miserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope.

True to our promise, we told Mrs. Harker everything
which had passed. And although she grew snowy white at times
when danger had seemed to threaten her husband, and red at
others when his devotion to her was manifested she listened
bravely and with calmness. When we came to the part where
Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly, she clung to
her husband's arm, and held it tight as though her clinging
could protect him from any harm that might come. She said
nothing, however, till the narration was all done, and matters
had been brought up to the present time.

Then without letting go her husband's hand she stood up
amongst us and spoke. Oh, that I could give any idea of the
scene. Of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the rad-
iant beauty of her youth and animation, with the red scar on
her forehead, of which she was conscious, and which we saw
with grinding of our teeth, remembering whence and how it
came. Her loving kindness against our grim hate. Her tender
faith against all our fears and doubting. And we, knowing
that so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness and
purity and faith, was outcast from God.

"Jonathan," she said, and the word sounded like music
on her lips it was so full of love and tenderness, "Jonathan
dear, and you all my true, true friends, I want you to bear
something in mind through all this dreadful time. I know that
you must fight. That you must destroy even as you destroyed
the false Lucy so that the true Lucy might live hereafter.
But it is not a work of hate. That poor soul who has wrought
all this misery is the saddest case of all. Just think what
will be his joy when he, too, is destroyed in his worser part
that his better part may have spiritual immortality. You must
be pitiful to him, too, though it may not hold your hands from
his destruction."

As she spoke I could see her husband's face darken and
draw together, as though the passion in him were shriveling
his being to its core. Instinctively the clasp on his wife's
hand grew closer, till his knuckles looked white. She did
not flinch from the pain which I knew she must have suffered,
but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing than
ever.

As she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet, almost
tearing his hand from hers as he spoke.

"May God give him into my hand just for long enough to
destroy that earthly life of him which we are aiming at. If
beyond it I could send his soul forever and ever to burning
hell I would do it!"

"Oh, hush! Oh, hush in the name of the good God. Don't
say such things, Jonathan, my husband, or you will crush me
with fear and horror. Just think, my dear. . .I have been
thinking all this long, long day of it. . .that. . .
perhaps. . .some day. . . I, too, may need such pity, and
that some other like you, and with equal cause for anger, may
deny it to me! Oh, my husband! My husband, indeed I would
have spared you such a thought had there been another way.
But I pray that God may not have treasured your wild words,
except as the heart-broken wail of a very loving and sorely
stricken man. Oh, God, let these poor white hairs go in ev-
idence of what he has suffered, who all his life has done no
wrong, and on whom so many sorrows have come."

We men were all in tears now. There was no resisting
them, and we wept openly. She wept, too, to see that her
sweeter counsels had prevailed. Her husband flung himself
on his knees beside her, and putting his arms round her, hid
his face in the folds of her dress. Van Helsing beckoned to
us and we stole out of the room, leaving the two loving
hearts alone with their God.

Before they retired the Professor fixed up the room
against any coming of the Vampire, and assured Mrs. Harker
that she might rest in peace. She tried to school herself
to the belief, and manifestly for her husband's sake, tried
to seem content. It was a brave struggle, and was, I think
and believe, not without its reward. Van Helsing had placed
at hand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of
any emergency. When they had retired, Quincey, Godalming,
and I arranged that we should sit up, dividing the night
between us, and watch over the safety of the poor stricken
lady. The first watch falls to Quincey, so the rest of us
shall be off to bed as soon as we can.

Godalming has already turned in, for his is the second
watch. Now that my work is done I, too, shall go to bed.





JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


3-4 October, close to midnight.--I thought yesterday
would never end. There was over me a yearning for sleep, in
some sort of blind belief that to wake would be to find
things changed, and that any change must now be for the
better. Before we parted, we discussed what our next step
was to be, but we could arrive at no result. All we knew
was that one earth box remained, and that the Count alone
knew where it was. If he chooses to lie hidden, he may baffle
us for years. And in the meantime, the thought is too horr-
ible, I dare not think of it even now. This I know, that if
ever there was a woman who was all perfection, that one is my
poor wronged darling. I loved her a thousand times more for
her sweet pity of last night, a pity that made my own hate of
the monster seem despicable. Surely God will not permit the
world to be the poorer by the loss of such a creature. This
is hope to me. We are all drifting reefwards now, and faith
is our only anchor. Thank God! Mina is sleeping, and sleeping
without dreams. I fear what her dreams might be like, with
such terrible memories to ground them in. She has not been
so calm, within my seeing, since the sunset. Then, for a
while, there came over her face a repose which was like
spring after the blasts of March. I thought at the time that
it was the softness of the red sunset on her face, but some-
how now I think it has a deeper meaning. I am not sleepy
myself, though I am weary. . .weary to death. However, I
must try to sleep. For there is tomorrow to think of, and
there is no rest for me until. . .


Later--I must have fallen asleep, for I was awakened by
Mina, who was sitting up in bed, with a startled look on her
face. I could see easily, for we did not leave the room in
darkness. She had placed a warning hand over my mouth, and
now she whispered in my ear, "Hush! There is someone in the
corridor!" I got up softly, and crossing the room, gently
opened the door.

Just outside, stretched on a mattress, lay Mr. Morris,
wide awake. He raised a warning hand for silence as he whis-
pered to me, "Hush! Go back to bed. It is all right. One
of us will be here all night. We don't mean to take any
chances!"

His look and gesture forbade discussion, so I came back
and told Mina. She sighed and positively a shadow of a smile
stole over her poor, pale face as she put her arms round me
and said softly, "Oh, thank God for good brave men!" With a
sigh she sank back again to sleep. I write this now as I am
not sleepy, though I must try again.


4 October, morning.--Once again during the night I was
wakened by Mina. This time we had all had a good sleep, for
the grey of the coming dawn was making the windows into
sharp oblongs, and the gas flame was like a speck rather than
a disc of light.

She said to me hurriedly, "Go, call the Professor. I
want to see him at once."

"Why?" I asked.

"I have an idea. I suppose it must have come in the
night, and matured without my knowing it. He must hypnotize
me before the dawn, and then I shall be able to speak. Go
quick, dearest, the time is getting close."

I went to the door. Dr. Seward was resting on the matt-
ress, and seeing me, he sprang to his feet.

"Is anything wrong?" he asked, in alarm.

"No," I replied. "But Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsing
at once."

"I will go," he said, and hurried into the Professor's
room.

Two or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room
in his dressing gown, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming were
with Dr. Seward at the door asking questions. When the Pro-
fessor saw Mina a smile, a positive smile ousted the anxiety
of his face.

He rubbed his hands as he said, "Oh, my dear Madam
Mina, this is indeed a change. See! Friend Jonathan, we
have got our dear Madam Mina, as of old, back to us today!"
Then turning to her, he said cheerfully, "And what am I to
do for you? For at this hour you do not want me for nothing."

"I want you to hypnotize me!" she said. "Do it before
the dawn, for I feel that then I can speak, and speak free-
ly. Be quick, for the time is short!" Without a word he
motioned her to sit up in bed.

Looking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passes in
front of her, from over the top of her head downward, with
each hand in turn. Mina gazed at him fixedly for a few min-
utes, during which my own heart beat like a trip hammer, for
I felt that some crisis was at hand. Gradually her eyes
closed, and she sat, stock still. Only by the gentle heaving
of her bosom could one know that she was alive. The Professor
made a few more passes and then stopped, and I could see that
his forehead was covered with great beads of perspiration.
Mina opened her eyes, but she did not seem the same woman.
There was a far-away look in her eyes, and her voice had a
sad dreaminess which was new to me. Raising his hand to im-
pose silence, the Professor motioned to me to bring the
others in. They came on tiptoe, closing the door behind them,
and stood at the foot of the bed, looking on. Mina appeared
not to see them. The stillness was broken by Van Helsing's
voice speaking in a low level tone which would not break the
current of her thoughts.

"Where are you?" The answer came in a neutral way.

"I do not know. Sleep has no place it can call its own."
For several minutes there was silence. Mina sat rigid, and
the Professor stood staring at her fixedly.

The rest of us hardly dared to breathe. The room was
growing lighter. Without taking his eyes from Mina's face,
Dr. Van Helsing motioned me to pull up the blind. I did so,
and the day seemed just upon us. A red streak shot up, and a
rosy light seemed to diffuse itself through the room. On the
instant the Professor spoke again.

"Where are you now?"

The answer came dreamily, but with intention. It were
as though she were interpreting something. I have heard her
use the same tone when reading her shorthand notes.

"I do not know. It is all strange to me!"

"What do you see?"

"I can see nothing. It is all dark."

"What do you hear?" I could detect the strain in the
Professor's patient voice.

"The lapping of water. It is gurgling by, and little
waves leap. I can hear them on the outside."

"Then you are on a ship?'"

We all looked at each other, trying to glean something
each from the other. We were afraid to think.

The answer came quick, "Oh, yes!"

"What else do you hear?"

"The sound of men stamping overhead as they run about.
There is the creaking of a chain, and the loud tinkle as the
check of the capstan falls into the ratchet."

"What are you doing?"

"I am still, oh so still. It is like death!" The voice
faded away into a deep breath as of one sleeping, and the
open eyes closed again.

By this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the
full light of day. Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on Mina's
shoulders, and laid her head down softly on her pillow. She
lay like a sleeping child for a few moments, and then, with
a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to see us all around
her.

"Have I been talking in my sleep?" was all she said. She
seemed, however, to know the situation without telling, though
she was eager to know what she had told. The Professor re-
peated the conversation, and she said, "Then there is not a
moment to lose. It may not be yet too late!"

Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming started for the door but
the Professor's calm voice called them back.

"Stay, my friends. That ship, wherever it was, was
weighing anchor at the moment in your so great Port of Lon-
don. Which of them is it that you seek? God be thanked that
we have once again a clue, though whither it may lead us we
know not. We have been blind somewhat. Blind after the
manner of men, since we can look back we see what we might
have seen looking forward if we had been able to see what we
might have seen! Alas, but that sentence is a puddle, is it
not? We can know now what was in the Count's mind, when he
seize that money, though Jonathan's so fierce knife put him
in the danger that even he dread. He meant escape. Hear me,
ESCAPE! He saw that with but one earth box left, and a pack
of men following like dogs after a fox, this London was no
place for him. He have take his last earth box on board a
ship, and he leave the land. He think to escape, but no! We
follow him. Tally Ho! As friend Arthur would say when he
put on his red frock! Our old fox is wily. Oh! So wily,
and we must follow with wile. I, too, am wily and I think
his mind in a little while. In meantime we may rest and in
peace, for there are between us which he do not want to pass,
and which he could not if he would. Unless the ship were to
touch the land, and then only at full or slack tide. See, and
the sun is just rose, and all day to sunset is us. Let us
take bath, and dress, and have breakfast which we all need,
and which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the same
land with us."

Mina looked at him appealingly as she asked, "But why
need we seek him further, when he is gone away from us?"

He took her hand and patted it as he replied, "Ask me
nothing as yet. When we have breakfast, then I answer all
questions." He would say no more, and we separated to dress.

After breakfast Mina repeated her question. He looked
at her gravely for a minute and then said sorrowfully, "Be-
cause my dear, dear Madam Mina, now more than ever must we
find him even if we have to follow him to the jaws of Hell!"

She grew paler as she asked faintly, "Why?"

"Because," he answered solemnly, "he can live for cen-
turies, and you are but mortal woman. Time is now to be
dreaded, since once he put that mark upon your throat."

I was just in time to catch her as she fell forward in
a faint.





CHAPTER 24


DR. SEWARD'S PHONOGRAPH DIARY

SPOKEN BY VAN HELSING


This to Jonathan Harker.

You are to stay with your dear Madam Mina. We shall go
to make our search, if I can call it so, for it is not search
but knowing, and we seek confirmation only. But do you stay
and take care of her today. This is your best and most hol-
iest office. This day nothing can find him here.

Let me tell you that so you will know what we four know
already, for I have tell them. He, our enemy, have gone away.
He have gone back to his Castle in Transylvania. I know it so
well, as if a great hand of fire wrote it on the wall. He
have prepare for this in some way, and that last earth box
was ready to ship somewheres. For this he took the money. For
this he hurry at the last, lest we catch him before the sun
go down. It was his last hope, save that he might hide in the
tomb that he think poor Miss Lucy, being as he thought like
him, keep open to him. But there was not of time. When that
fail he make straight for his last resource, his last earth-
work I might say did I wish double entente. He is clever, oh
so clever! He know that his game here was finish. And so he
decide he go back home. He find ship going by the route he
came, and he go in it.

We go off now to find what ship, and whither bound.
When we have discover that, we come back and tell you all.
Then we will comfort you and poor Madam Mina with new hope.
For it will be hope when you think it over, that all is not
lost. This very creature that we pursue, he take hundreds
of years to get so far as London. And yet in one day, when
we know of the disposal of him we drive him out. He is
finite, though he is powerful to do much harm and suffers
not as we do. But we are strong, each in our purpose, and
we are all more strong together. Take heart afresh, dear
husband of Madam Mina. This battle is but begun and in the
end we shall win. So sure as that God sits on high to watch
over His children. Therefore be of much comfort till we
return.

VAN HELSING.





JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


4 October.--When I read to Mina, Van Helsing's message
in the phonograph, the poor girl brightened up considerably.
Already the certainty that the Count is out of the country
has given her comfort. And comfort is strength to her. For
my own part, now that his horrible danger is not face to face
with us, it seems almost impossible to believe in it. Even my
own terrible experiences in Castle Dracula seem like a long
forgotten dream. Here in the crisp autumn air in the bright
sunlight.

Alas! How can I disbelieve! In the midst of my thought
my eye fell on the red scar on my poor darling's white fore-
head. Whilst that lasts, there can be no disbelief. Mina
and I fear to be idle, so we have been over all the diaries
again and again. Somehow, although the reality seem greater
each time, the pain and the fear seem less. There is some-
thing of a guiding purpose manifest throughout, which is
comforting. Mina says that perhaps we are the instruments
of ultimate good. It may be! I shall try to think as she
does. We have never spoken to each other yet of the future.
It is better to wait till we see the Professor and the
others after their investigations.

The day is running by more quickly than I ever thought
a day could run for me again. It is now three o'clock.





MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


5 October, 5 P.M.--Our meeting for report. Present:
Professor Van Helsing, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Mr. Quincey
Morris, Jonathan Harker, Mina Harker.

Dr. Van Helsing described what steps were taken during
the day to discover on what boat and whither bound Count
Dracula made his escape.

"As I knew that he wanted to get back to Transylvania,
I felt sure that he must go by the Danube mouth, or by some-
where in the Black Sea, since by that way he come. It was a
dreary blank that was before us. Omme Ignotum pro magnifico.
And so with heavy hearts we start to find what ships leave
for the Black Sea last night. He was in sailing ship, since
Madam Mina tell of sails being set. These not so important
as to go in your list of the shipping in the Times, and so we
go, by suggestion of Lord Godalming, to your Lloyd's, where
are note of all ships that sail, however so small. There we
find that only one Black Sea bound ship go out with the tide.
She is the Czarina Catherine, and she sail from Doolittle's
Wharf for Varna, and thence to other ports and up the Danube.
`So!' said I, `this is the ship whereon is the Count.' So
off we go to Doolittle's Wharf, and there we find a man in an
office. From him we inquire o f the goings of the Czarina
Catherine. He swear much, and he red face and loud of voice,
but he good fellow all the same. And when Quincey give him
something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, and
put it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his cloth-
ing, he still better fellow and humble servant to us. He come
with us, and ask many men who are rough and hot. These be
better fellows too when they have been no more thirsty. They
say much of blood and bloom, and of others which I comprehend
not, though I guess what they mean. But nevertheless they
tell us all things which we want to know.

"They make known to us among them, how last afternoon
at about five o'clock comes a man so hurry. A tall man, thin
and pale, with high nose and teeth so white, and eyes that
seem to be burning. That he be all in black, except that he
have a hat of straw which suit not him or the time. That he
scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what ship
sails for the Black Sea and for where. Some took him to the
office and then to the ship, where he will not go aboard but
halt at shore end of gangplank, and ask that the captain come
to him. The captain come, when told that he will be pay well,
and though he swear much at the first he agree to term. Then
the thin man go and some one tell him where horse and cart
can be hired. He go there and soon he come again, himself
driving cart on which a great box. This he himself lift down,
though it take several to put it on truck for the ship. He
give much talk to captain as to how and where his box is to
be place. But the captain like it not and swear at him in
many tongues, and tell him that if he like he can come and
see where it shall be. But he say `no,' that he come not yet,
for that he have much to do. Whereupon the captain tell him
that he had better be quick, with blood, for that his ship
will leave the place, of blood, before the turn of the tide,
with blood. Then the thin man smile and say that of course
he must go when he think fit, but he will be surprise if he
go quite so soon. The captain swear again, polyglot, and
the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that he
will so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before
the sailing. Final the captain, more red than ever, and in
more tongues, tell him that he doesn't want no Frenchmen,
with bloom upon them and also with blood, in his ship, with
blood on her also. And so, after asking where he might pur-
chase ship forms, he departed.

"No one knew where he went `or bloomin' well cared' as
they said, for they had something else to think of, well with
blood again. For it soon became apparent to all that the
Czarina Catherine would not sail as was expected.  A thin mist
began to creep up from the river, and it grew, and grew. Till
soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her. The
captain swore polyglot, very polyglot, polyglot with bloom
and blood, but he could do nothing. The water rose and rose,
and he began to fear that he would lose the tide altogether.
He was in no friendly mood, when just at full tide, the thin
man came up the gangplank again and asked to see where his
box had been stowed. Then the captain replied that he wished
that he and his box, old and with much bloom and blood, were
in hell. But the thin man did not be offend, and went down
with the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and
stood awhile on deck in fog. He must have come off by himself,
for none notice him. Indeed they thought not of him, for soon
the fog begin to melt away, and all was clear again. My
friends of the thirst and the language that was of bloom and
blood laughed, as they told how the captain's swears exceeded
even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of pic-
turesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on
movement up and down the river that hour, he found that few
of them had seen any of fog at all, except where it lay round
the wharf. However, the ship went out on the ebb tide, and
was doubtless by morning far down the river mouth. She was
then, when they told us, well out to sea.

"And so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest
for a time, for our enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his
command, on his way to the Danube mouth. To sail a ship takes
time, go she never so quick. And when we start to go on land
more quick, and we meet him there. Our best hope is to come
on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset. For then
he can make no struggle, and we may deal with him as we
should. There are days for us, in which we can make ready our
plan. We know all about where he go. For we have seen the
owner of the ship, who have shown us invoices and all papers
that can be. The box we seek is to be landed in Varna, and
to be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there present
his credentials. And so our merchant friend will have done
his part. When he ask if there be any wrong, for that so, he
can telegraph and have inquiry made at Varna, we say `no,'
for what is to be done is not for police or of the customs.
It must be done by us alone and in our own way."

When Dr. Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked him if
he were certain that the Count had remained on board the
ship. He replied, "We have the best proof of that, your own
evidence, when in the hypnotic trance this morning."

I asked him again if it were really necessary that they
should pursue the Count, for oh! I dread Jonathan leaving me,
and I know that he would surely go if the others went. He
answered in growing passion, at first quietly. As he went on,
however, he grew more angry and more forceful, till in the
end we could not but see wherein was at least some of that
personal dominance which made him so long a master amongst
men.

"Yes, it is necessary, necessary, necessary! For your
sake in the first, and then for the sake of humanity. This
monster has done much harm already, in the narrow scope
where he find himself, and in the short time when as yet he
was only as a body groping his so small measure in darkness
and not knowing. All this have I told these others. You, my
dear Madam Mina, will learn it in the phonograph of my friend
John, or in that of your husband. I have told them how the
measure of leaving his own barren land, barren of peoples, and
coming to a new land where life of man teems till they are
like the multitude of standing corn, was the work of cen-
turies. Were another of the Undead, like him, to try to do
what he has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world
that have been, or that will be, could aid him. With this one,
all the forces of nature that are occult and deep and strong
must have worked together in some wonderous way. The very
place, where he have been alive, Undead for all these cen-
turies, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical
world. There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none
know whither. There have been volcanoes, some of whose open-
ings still send out waters of strange properties, and gases
that kill or make to vivify. Doubtless, there is something
magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of occult
forces which work for physical life in strange way, and in
himself were from the first some great qualities. In a hard
and warlike time he was celebrate that he have more iron
nerve, more subtle brain, more braver heart, than any man. In
him some vital principle have in strange way found their ut-
most. And as his body keep strong and grow and thrive, so
his brain grow too. All this without that diabolic aid which
is surely to him. For it have to yield to the powers that
come from, and are, symbolic of good. And now this is what
he is to us. He have infect you, oh forgive me, my dear, that
I must say such, but it is for good of you that I speak. He
infect you in such wise, that even if he do no more, you have
only to live, to live in your own old, sweet way, and so in
time, death, which is of man's common lot and with God's sanc-
tion, shall make you like to him. This must not be! We have
sworn together that it must not. Thus are we ministers of
God's own wish. That the world, and men for whom His Son die,
will not be given over to monsters, whose very existence
would defame Him. He have allowed us to redeem one soul al-
ready, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to re-
deem more. Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise.
And like them, if we fall, we fall in good cause."

He paused and I said, "But will not the Count take his
rebuff wisely? Since he has been driven from England, will
he not avoid it, as a tiger does the village from which he
has been hunted?"

"Aha!" he said, "your simile of the tiger good, for me,
and I shall adopt him. Your maneater, as they of India call
the tiger who has once tasted blood of the human, care no
more for the other prey, but prowl unceasing till he get him.
This that we hunt from our village is a tiger, too, a manea-
ter, and he never cease to prowl. Nay, in himself he is not
one to retire and stay afar. In his life, his living life, he
go over the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own
ground. He be beaten back, but did he stay? No! He come
again, and again, and again. Look at his persistence and en-
durance. With the child-brain that was to him he have long
since conceive the idea of coming to a great city. What does
he do? He find out the place of all the world most of pro-
mise for him. Then he deliberately set himself down to
prepare for the task. He find in patience just how is his
strength, and what are his powers. He study new tongues. He
learn new social life, new environment of old ways, the pol-
itics, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of a new
land and a new people who have come to be since he was. His
glimpse that he have had, whet his appetite only and enkeen
his desire. Nay, it help him to grow as to his brain. For it
all prove to him how right he was at the first in his sur-
mises. He have done this alone, all alone! From a ruin tomb
in a forgotten land. What more may he not do when the greater
world of thought is open to him. He that can smile at death,
as we know him. Who can flourish in the midst of diseases
that kill off whole peoples. Oh! If such an one was to come
from God, and not the Devil, what a force for good might he
not be in this old world of ours. But we are pledged to set
the world free. Our toil must be in silence, and our efforts
all in secret. For in this enlightened age, when men believe
not even what they see, the doubting of wise men would be his
greatest strength. It would be at once his sheath and his
armor, and his weapons to destroy us, his enemies, who are
willing to peril even our own souls for the safety of one we
love. For the good of mankind, and for the honor and glory of
God."

After a general discussion it was determined that for
tonight nothing be definitely settled. That we should all
sleep on the facts, and try to think out the proper conclu-
sions. Tomorrow, at breakfast, we are to meet again, and
after making our conclusions known to one another, we shall
decide on some definite cause of action. . .

I feel a wonderful peace and rest tonight. It is as if
some haunting presence were removed from me. Perhaps. . .

My surmise was not finished, could not be, for I caught
sight in the mirror of the red mark upon my forehead, and I
knew that I was still unclean.





DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


5 October.--We all arose early, and I think that sleep
did much for each and all of us. When we met at early break-
fast there was more general cheerfulness than any of us had
ever expected to experience again.

It is really wonderful how much resilience there is in
human nature. Let any obstructing cause, no matter what, be
removed in any way, even by death, and we fly back to first
principles of hope and enjoyment. More than once as we sat
around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether the whole
of the past days had not been a dream. It was only when I
caught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker's forehead that
I was brought back to reality. Even now, when I am gravely
revolving the matter, it is almost impossible to realize that
the cause of all our trouble is still existent. Even Mrs.
Harker seems to lose sight of her trouble for whole spells.
It is only now and again, when something recalls it to her
mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar. We are to meet
here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of
action. I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by
instinct rather than reason. We shall all have to speak
frankly. And yet I fear that in some mysterious way poor Mrs.
Harker's tongue is tied. I know that she forms conclusions
of her own, and from all that has been I can guess how brill-
iant and how true they must be. But she will not, or cannot,
give them utterance. I have mentioned this to Van Helsing,
and he and I are to talk it over when we are alone. I suppose
it is some of that horrid poison which has got into her
veins beginning to work. The Count had his own purposes when
he gave her what Van Helsing called "the Vampire's baptism
of blood." Well, there may be a poison that distills itself
out of good things. In an age when the existence of ptomaines
is a mystery we should not wonder at anything! One thing I
know, that if my instinct be true regarding poor Mrs. Harker's
silences, then there is a terrible difficulty, an unknown
danger, in the work before us. The same power that compels
her silence may compel her speech. I dare not think further,
for so I should in my thoughts dishonor a noble woman!


Later.--When the Professor came in, we talked over the
state of things. I could see that he had something on his
mind, which he wanted to say, but felt some hesitancy about
broaching the subject. After beating about the bush a little,
he said, "Friend John, there is something that you and I must
talk of alone, just at the first at any rate. Later, we may
have to take the others into our confidence."

Then he stopped, so I waited. He went on, "Madam Mina,
our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing."

A cold shiver ran through me to find my worst fears
thus endorsed. Van Helsing continued.

"With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this
time be warned before things go too far. Our task is now in
reality more difficult than ever, and this new trouble makes
every hour of the direst importance. I can see the charac-
teristics of the vampire coming in her face. It is now but
very, very slight. But it is to be seen if we have eyes to
notice without prejudge. Her teeth are sharper, and at times
her eyes are more hard. But these are not all, there is to
her the silence now often, as so it was with Miss Lucy. She
did not speak, even when she wrote that which she wished to
be known later. Now my fear is this. If it be that she can,
by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and hear, is
it not more true that he who have hypnotize her first, and
who have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his,
should if he will, compel her mind to disclose to him that
which she know?"

I nodded acquiescence. He went on, "Then, what we must
do is to prevent this. We must keep her ignorant of our in-
tent, and so she cannot tell what she know not. This is a
painful task! Oh, so painful that it heartbreak me to think
of it, but it must be. When today we meet, I must tell her
that for reason which we will not to speak she must not more
be of our council, but be simply guarded by us."

He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse
perspiration at the thought of the pain which he might have
to inflict upon the poor soul already so tortured. I knew
that it would be some sort of comfort to him if I told him
that I also had come to the same conclusion. For at any
rate it would take away the pain of doubt. I told him, and
the effect was as I expected.

It is now close to the time of our general gathering.
Van Helsing has gone away to prepare for the meeting, and
his painful part of it. I really believe his purpose is to
be able to pray alone.


Later.--At the very outset of our meeting a great per-
sonal relief was experienced by both Van Helsing and myself.
Mrs. Harker had sent a message by her husband to say that
she would not join us at present, as she thought it better
that we should be free to discuss our movements without her
presence to embarrass us. The Professor and I looked at
each other for an instant, and somehow we both seemed
relieved. For my own part, I thought that if Mrs. Harker
realized the danger herself, it was much pain as well as
much danger averted. Under the circumstances we agreed, by
a questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, to pre-
serve silence in our suspicions, until we should have been
able to confer alone again. We went at once into our Plan
of Campaign.

Van Helsing roughly put the facts before us first, "The
Czarina Catherine left the Thames yesterday morning. It will
take her at the quickest speed she has ever made at least
three weeks to reach Varna. But we can travel overland to
the same place in three days. Now, if we allow for two days
less for the ship's voyage, owing to such weather influences
as we know that the Count can bring to bear, and if we allow
a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us,
then we have a margin of nearly two weeks.

"Thus, in order to be quite safe, we must leave here on
17th at latest. Then we shall at any rate be in Varna a day
before the ship arrives, and able to make such preparations
as may be necessary. Of course we shall all go armed, armed
against evil things, spiritual as well as physical."

Here Quincey Morris added, "I understand that the Count
comes from a wolf country, and it may be that he shall get
there before us. I propose that we add Winchesters to our
armament. I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when
there is any trouble of that sort around. Do you remember,
Art, when we had the pack after us at Tobolsk? What wouldn't
we have given then for a repeater apiece!"

"Good!" said Van Helsing, "Winchesters it shall be.
Quincey's head is level at times, but most so when there is
to hunt, metaphor be more dishonor to science than wolves be
of danger to man. In the meantime we can do nothing here.
And as I think that Varna is not familiar to any of us, why
not go there more soon? It is as long to wait here as there.
Tonight and tomorrow we can get ready, and then if all be
well, we four can set out on our journey."

"We four?" said Harker interrogatively, looking from
one to another of us.

"Of course!" answered the Professor quickly. "You must
remain to take care of your so sweet wife!"

Harker was silent for awhile and then said in a hollow
voice, "Let us talk of that part of it in the morning. I
want to consult with Mina."

I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to
warn him not to disclose our plan to her, but he took no
notice. I looked at him significantly and coughed. For answer
he put his finger to his lips and turned away.





JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


October, afternoon.--For some time after our meeting
this morning I could not think. The new phases of things
leave my mind in a state of wonder which allows no room for
active thought. Mina's determination not to take any part
in the discussion set me thinking. And as I could not argue
the matter with her, I could only guess. I am as far as
ever from a solution now. The way the others received it,
too puzzled me. The last time we talked of the subject we
agreed that there was to be no more concealment of anything
amongst us. Mina is sleeping now, calmly and sweetly like a
little child. Her lips are curved and her face beams with
happiness. Thank God, there are such moments still for her.


Later.--How strange it all is. I sat watching Mina's
happy sleep, and I came as near to being happy myself as I
suppose I shall ever be. As the evening drew on, and the
earth took its shadows from the sun sinking lower, the si-
lence of the room grew more and more solemn to me.

All at once Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me
tenderly said, "Jonathan, I want you to promise me something
on your word of honor. A promise made to me, but made holily
in God's hearing, and not to be broken though I should go
down on my knees and implore you with bitter tears. Quick,
you must make it to me at once."

"Mina," I said, "a promise like that, I cannot make at
once. I may have no right to make it."

"But, dear one," she said, with such spiritual inten-
sity that her eyes were like pole stars, "it is I who wish
it. And it is not for myself. You can ask Dr. Van Helsing
if I am not right. If he disagrees you may do as you will.
Nay, more if you all agree, later you are absolved from the
promise."

"I promise!"I said, and for a moment she looked suprem-
ely happy. Though to me all happiness for her was denied by
the red scar on her forehead.

She said, "Promise me that you will not tell me any-
thing of the plans formed for the campaign against the Count.
Not by word, or inference, or implication, not at any time
whilst this remains to me!" And she solemnly pointed to the
scar. I saw that she was in earnest, and said solemnly, "I
promise!" and as I said it I felt that from that instant a
door had been shut between us.


Later, midnight.--Mina has been bright and cheerful all
the evening. So much so that all the rest seemed to take
courage, as if infected somewhat with her gaiety. As a re-
sult even I myself felt as if the pall of gloom which weighs
us down were somewhat lifted. We all retired early. Mina
is now sleeping like a little child. It is wonderful thing
that her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her
terrible trouble. Thank God for it, for then at least she
can forget her care. Perhaps her example may affect me as
her gaiety did tonight. I shall try it. Oh! For a dream-
less sleep.

6 October, morning.--Another surprise. Mina woke me
early, about the same time as yesterday, and asked me to
bring Dr. Van Helsing. I thought that it was another occas-
sion for hypnotism, and without question went for the Pro-
fessor. He had evidently expected some such call, for I
found him dressed in his room. His door was ajar, so that
he could hear the opening of the door of our room. He came
at once. As he passed into the room, he asked Mina if the
others might come, too.

"No," she said quite simply, "it will not be necessary.
You can tell them just as well. I must go with you on your
journey."

Dr. Van Helsing was as startled as I was. After a mom-
ent's pause he asked, "But why?"

"You must take me with you. I am safer with you, and
you shall be safer, too."

"But why, dear Madam Mina? You know that your safety
is our solemnest duty. We go into danger, to which you are,
or may be, more liable than any of us from. . .from cir-
cumstances. . .things that have been." He paused embar-
rassed.

As she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to
her forehead. "I know. That is why I must go. I can tell
you now, whilst the sun is coming up. I may not be able
again. I know that when the Count wills me I must go. I
know that if he tells me to come in secret, I must by wile.
By any device to hoodwink, even Jonathan." God saw the look
that she turned on me as she spoke, and if there be indeed a
Recording Angel that look is noted to her ever-lasting honor.
I could only clasp her hand. I could not speak. My emotion
was too great for even the relief of tears.

She went on. "You men are brave and strong. You are
strong in your numbers, for you can defy that which would
break down the human endurance of one who had to guard alone.
Besides, I may be of service, since you can hypnotize me and
so learn that which even I myself do not know."

Dr. Van Helsing said gravely, "Madam Mina, you are, as
always, most wise. You shall with us come. And together we
shall do that which we go forth to achieve."

When he had spoken, Mina's long spell of silence made
me look at her. She had fallen back on her pillow asleep.
She did not even wake when I had pulled up the blind and let
in the sunlight which flooded the room. Van Helsing motioned
to me to come with him quietly. We went to his room, and
within a minute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris
were with us also.

He told them what Mina had said, and went on. "In the
morning we shall leave for Varna. We have now to deal with
a new factor, Madam Mina. Oh, but her soul is true. It is
to her an agony to tell us so much as she has done. But it
is most right, and we are warned in time. There must be no
chance lost, and in Varna we must be ready to act the in-
stant when that ship arrives."

"What shall we do exactly?" asked Mr. Morris laconically.

The Professor paused before replying, "We shall at the
first board that ship. Then, when we have identified the
box, we shall place a branch of the wild rose on it. This
we shall fasten, for when it is there none can emerge, so
that at least says the superstition. And to superstition
must we trust at the first. It was man's faith in the early,
and it have its root in faith still. Then, when we get the
opportunity that we seek, when none are near to see, we shall
open the box, and. . .and all will be well."

"I shall not wait for any opportunity," said Morris.
"When I see the box I shall open it and destroy the monster,
though there were a thousand men looking on, and if I am to
be wiped out for it the next moment!" I grasped his hand in-
stinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel. I think
he understood my look. I hope he did.

"Good boy," said Dr. Van Helsing. "Brave boy. Quincey
is all man. God bless him for it. My child, believe me none
of us shall lag behind or pause from any fear. I do but say
what we may do. . .what we must do. But, indeed, indeed we
cannot say what we may do. There are so many things which may
happen, and their ways and their ends are so various that
until the moment we may not say. We shall all be armed, in
all ways. And when the time for the end has come, our effort
shall not be lack. Now let us today put all our affairs in
order. Let all things which touch on others dear to us, and
who on us depend, be complete. For none of us can tell what,
or when, or how, the end may be. As for me, my own affairs
are regulate, and as I have nothing else to do, I shall go
make arrangements for the travel. I shall have all tickets
and so forth for our journey."

There was nothing further to be said, and we parted. I
shall now settle up all my affairs of earth, and be ready for
whatever may come.


Later.--It is done. My will is made, and all complete.
Mina if she survive is my sole heir. If it should not be
so, then the others who have been so good to us shall have
remainder.

It is now drawing towards the sunset. Mina's uneasi-
ness calls my attention to it. I am sure that there is
something on her mind which the time of exact sunset will
reveal. These occasions are becoming harrowing times for us
all. For each sunrise and sunset opens up some new danger,
some new pain, which however, may in God's will be means to
a good end. I write all these things in the diary since my
darling must not hear them now. But if it may be that she
can see them again, they shall be ready. She is calling to me.





CHAPTER 25


DR SEWARD'S DIARY


11 October, Evening.--Jonathan Harker has asked me to
note this, as he says he is hardly equal to the task, and he
wants an exact record kept.

I think that none of us were surprised when we were
asked to see Mrs. Harker a little before the time of sunset.
We have of late come to understand that sunrise and sunset
are to her times of peculiar freedom. When her old self can
be manifest without any controlling force subduing or re-
straining her, or inciting her to action. This mood or
condition begins some half hour or more before actual sun-
rise or sunset, and lasts till either the sun is high, or
whilst the clouds are still aglow with the rays streaming
above the horizon. At first there is a sort of negative
condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the abso-
lute freedom quickly follows. When, however, the freedom
ceases the change back or relapse comes quickly, preceeded
only by a spell of warning silence.

Tonight, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and
bore all the signs of an internal struggle. I put it down
myself to her making a violent effort at the earliest
instant she could do so.

A very few minutes, however, gave her complete control
of herself. Then, motioning her husband to sit beside her
on the sofa where she was half reclining, she made the rest
of us bring chairs up close.

Taking her husband's hand in hers, she began, "We are
all here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time! I
know that you will always be with me to the end." This was
to her husband whose hand had, as we could see, tightened
upon her. "In the morning we go out upon our task, and God
alone knows what may be in store for any of us. You are
going to be so good to me to take me with you. I know that
all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weak woman,
whose soul perhaps is lost, no, no, not yet, but is at any
rate at stake, you will do. But you must remember that I am
not as you are. There is a poison in my blood, in my soul,
which may destroy me, which must destroy me, unless some re-
lief comes to us. Oh, my friends, you know as well as I do,
that my soul is at stake. And though I know there is one way
out for me, you must not and I must not take it!" She looked
appealingly to us all in turn, beginning and ending with her
husband.

"What is that way?" asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice.
"What is that way, which we must not, may not, take?"

"That I may die now, either by my own hand or that of
another, before the greater evil is entirely wrought. I know,
and you know, that were I once dead you could and would set
free my immortal spirit, even as you did my poor Lucy's. Were
death, or the fear of death, the only thing that stood in the
way I would not shrink to die here now, amidst the friends
who love me. But death is not all. I cannot believe that to
die in such a case, when there is hope before us and a bitter
task to be done, is God's will. Therefore, I on my part, give
up here the certainty of eternal rest, and go out into the
dark where may be the blackest things that the world or the
nether world holds!"

We were all silent, for we knew instinctively that this
was only a prelude. The faces of the others were set, and
Harker's grew ashen grey. Perhaps, he guessed better than
any of us what was coming.

She continued, "This is what I can give into the hotch-
pot." I could not but note the quaint legal phrase which
she used in such a place, and with all seriousness. "What
will each of you give? Your lives I know," she went on
quickly, "that is easy for brave men. Your lives are God's,
and you can give them back to Him, but what will you give to
me?" She looked again questionly, but this time avoided her
husband's face. Quincey seemed to understand, he nodded, and
her face lit up. "Then I shall tell you plainly what I want,
for there must be no doubtful matter in this connection be-
tween us now. You must promise me, one and all, even you, my
beloved husband, that should the time come, you will kill me."

"What is that time?" The voice was Quincey's, but it
was low and strained.

"When you shall be convinced that I am so changed that
it is better that I die that I may live. When I am thus
dead in the flesh, then you will, without a moment's delay,
drive a stake through me and cut off my head, or do what-
ever else may be wanting to give me rest!"

Quincey was the first to rise after the pause. He knelt
down before her and taking her hand in his said solemnly,
"I'm only a rough fellow, who hasn't, perhaps, lived as a
man should to win such a distinction, but I swear to you by
all that I hold sacred and dear that, should the time ever
come, I shall not flinch from the duty that you have set us.
And I promise you, too, that I shall make all certain, for
if I am only doubtful I shall take it that the time has come!"

"My true friend!" was all she could say amid her fast-
falling tears, as bending over, she kissed his hand.

"I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!"said Van Helsing.
"And I!" said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling
to her to take the oath. I followed, myself.

Then her husband turned to her wan-eyed and with a
greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of his
hair, and asked, "And must I, too, make such a promise, oh,
my wife?"

"You too, my dearest," she said, with infinite yearning
of pity in her voice and eyes. "You must not shrink. You
are nearest and dearest and all the world to me. Our souls
are knit into one, for all life and all time. Think, dear,
that there have been times when brave men have killed their
wives and their womenkind, to keep them from falling into
the hands of the enemy. Their hands did not falter any the
more because those that they loved implored them to slay
them. It is men's duty towards those whom they love, in
such times of sore trial! And oh, my dear, if it is to be
that I must meet death at any hand, let it be at the hand of
him that loves me best. Dr. Van Helsing, I have not forgot-
ten your mercy in poor Lucy's case to him who loved." She
stopped with a flying blush, and changed her phrase, "to him
who had best right to give her peace. If that time shall
come again, I look to you to make it a happy memory of my
husband's life that it was his loving hand which set me free
from the awful thrall upon me."

"Again I swear!" came the Professor's resonant voice.

Mrs. Harker smiled, positively smiled, as with a sigh of
relief she leaned back and said, "And now one word of warn-
ing, a warning which you must never forget. This time, if it
ever come, may come quickly and unexpectedly, and in such
case you must lose no time in using your opportunity.  At such
a time I myself might be. . .nay! If the time ever come,
shall be, leagued with your enemy against you.

"One more request," she became very solemn as she said
this, "it is not vital and necessary like the other, but I
want you to do one thing for me, if you will."

We all acquiesced, but no one spoke. There was no need
to speak.

"I want you to read the Burial Service." She was inter-
rupted by a deep groan from her husband. Taking his hand in
hers, she held it over her heart, and continued. "You must
read it over me some day. Whatever may be the issue of all
this fearful state of things, it will be a sweet thought to
all or some of us. You, my dearest, will I hope read it, for
then it will be in your voice in my memory forever, come
what may!"

"But oh, my dear one," he pleaded, "death is afar off
from you."

"Nay," she said, holding up a warning hand. "I am
deeper in death at this moment than if the weight of an
earthly grave lay heavy upon me!"

"Oh, my wife, must I read it?" he said, before he began.

"It would comfort me, my husband!" was all she said,
and he began to read when she had got the book ready.

How can I, how could anyone, tell of that strange scene,
its solemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its horror, and withal,
its sweetness. Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a
travesty of bitter truth in anything holy or emotional, would
have been melted to the heart had he seen that little group
of loving and devoted friends kneeling round that stricken
and sorrowing lady. Or heard the tender passion of her hus-
band's voice, as in tones so broken and emotional that often
he had to pause, he read the simple and beautiful service
from the Burial of the Dead. I cannot go on. . .
words. . .and v-voices. . .f-fail m-me!

She was right in her instinct. Strange as it was,
bizarre as it may hereafter seem even to us who felt its
potent influence at the time, it comforted us much. And the
silence, which showed Mrs. Harker's coming relapse from her
freedom of soul, did not seem so full of despair to any of
us as we had dreaded.





JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


15 October, Varna.--We left Charing Cross on the morn-
ing of the 12th, got to Paris the same night, and took the
places secured for us in the Orient Express. We traveled
night and day, arriving here at about five o'clock. Lord
Godalming went to the Consulate to see if any telegram had
arrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel,
"the Odessus." The journey may have had incidents. I was,
however, too eager to get on, to care for them. Until the
Czarina Catherine comes into port there will be no interest
for me in anything in the wide world. Thank God! Mina is
well, and looks to be getting stronger. Her color is coming
back. She sleeps a great deal. Throughout the journey she
slept nearly all the time. Before sunrise and sunset, how-
ever, she is very wakeful and alert. And it has become a
habit for Van Helsing to hypnotize her at such times. At
first, some effort was needed, and he had to make many passes.
But now, she seems to yield at once, as if by habit, and
scarcely any action is needed. He seems to have power at
these particular moments to simply will, and her thoughts
obey him. He always asks her what she can see and hear.

She answers to the first, "Nothing, all is dark."

And to the second, "I can hear the waves lapping against
the ship, and the water rushing by. Canvas and cordage strain
and masts and yards creak. The wind is high. . .I can
hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam."

It is evident that the Czarina Catherine is still at
sea, hastening on her way to Varna. Lord Godalming has just
returned. He had four telegrams, one each day since we start-
ed, and all to the same effect. That the Czarina Catherine had
not been reported to Lloyd's from anywhere. He had arranged
before leaving London that his agent should send him every
day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported. He was
to have a message even if she were not reported, so that he
might be sure that there was a watch being kept at the other
end of the wire.

We had dinner and went to bed early. Tomorrow we are
to see the Vice Consul, and to arrange, if we can, about get-
ting on board the ship as soon as she arrives. Van Helsing
says that our chance will be to get on the boat between sun-
rise and sunset. The Count, even if he takes the form of a
bat, cannot cross the running water of his own volition, and
so cannot leave the ship. As he dare not change to man's
form without suspicion, which he evidently wishes to avoid,
he must remain in the box. If, then, we can come on board
after sunrise, he is at our mercy, for we can open the box
and make sure of him, as we did of poor Lucy, before he
wakes. What mercy he shall get from us all will not count
for much. We think that we shall not have much trouble with
officials or the seamen. Thank God! This is the country
where bribery can do anything, and we are well supplied with
money. We have only to make sure that the ship cannot come
into port between sunset and sunrise without our being
warned, and we shall be safe. Judge Moneybag will settle this
case, I think!


16 October.--Mina's report still the same. Lapping
waves and rushing water, darkness and favoring winds. We are
evidently in good time, and when we hear of the Czarina Cat-
herine we shall be ready. As she must pass the Dardanelles
we are sure to have some report.


17 October.--Everything is pretty well fixed now, I
think, to welcome the Count on his return from his tour. Go-
dalming told the shippers that he fancied that the box sent
aboard might contain something stolen from a friend of his,
and got a half consent that he might open it at his own risk.
The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain to give him
every facility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship,
and also a similar authorization to his agent at Varna. We
have seen the agent, who was much impressed with Godalming's
kindly manner to him, and we are all satisfied that whatever
he can do to aid our wishes will be done.

We have already arranged what to do in case we get the
box open. If the Count is there, Van Helsing and Seward
will cut off his head at once and drive a stake through his
heart. Morris and Godalming and I shall prevent interfer-
ence, even if we have to use the arms which we shall have
ready. The Professor says that if we can so treat the
Count's body, it will soon after fall into dust. In such
case there would be no evidence against us, in case any
suspicion of murder were aroused. But even if it were not,
we should stand or fall by our act, and perhaps some day
this very script may be evidence to come between some of us
and a rope. For myself, I should take the chance only too
thankfully if it were to come. We mean to leave no stone
unturned to carry out our intent. We have arranged with
certain officials that the instant the Czarina Catherine is
seen, we are to be informed by a special messenger.


24 October.--A whole week of waiting. Daily telegrams
to Godalming, but only the same story. "Not yet reported."
Mina's morning and evening hypnotic answer is unvaried. Lap-
ping waves, rushing water, and creaking masts.




TELEGRAM, OCTOBER 24TH
RUFUS SMITH, LLOYD'S, LONDON, TO LORD GODALMING, CARE OF

H. B. M. VICE CONSUL, VARNA

"Czarina Catherine reported this morning from Dardanelles."

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


25 October.--How I miss my phonograph! To write a
diary with a pen is irksome to me! But Van Helsing says I
must. We were all wild with excitement yesterday when Godal-
ming got his telegram from Lloyd's. I know now what men feel
in battle when the call to action is heard. Mrs. Harker, alone
of our party, did not show any signs of emotion.  After all, it
is not strange that she did not, for we took special care not
to let her know anything about it, and we all tried not to
show any excitement when we were in her presence. In old days
she would, I am sure, have noticed, no matter how we might
have tried to conceal it. But in this way she is greatly
changed during the past three weeks. The lethargy grows upon
her, and though she seems strong and well, and is getting
back some of her color, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied.
We talk of her often. We have not, however, said a word to
the others. It would break poor Harker's heart, certainly
his nerve, if he knew that we had even a suspicion on the
subject. Van Helsing examines, he tells me, her teeth very
carefully, whilst she is in the hypnotic condition, for he
says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is
no active danger of a change in her. If this change should
come, it would be necessary to take steps! We both know what
those steps would have to be, though we do not mention our
thoughts to each other. We should neither of us shrink from
the task, awful though it be to contemplate. "Euthanasia" is
an excellent and a comforting word! I am grateful to whoever
invented it.

It is only about 24 hours' sail from the Dardanelles to
here, at the rate the Czarina Catherine has come from London.
She should therefore arrive some time in the morning, but as
she cannot possibly get in before noon, we are all about to
retire early. We shall get up at one o'clock, so as to be
ready.


25 October, Noon.--No news yet of the ship's arrival.
Mrs. Harker's hypnotic report this morning was the same as
usual, so it is possible that we may get news at any moment.
We men are all in a fever of excitement, except Harker, who
is calm. His hands are cold as ice, and an hour ago I found
him whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka knife which he
now always carries with him. It will be a bad lookout for the
Count if the edge of that "Kukri" ever touches his throat,
driven by that stern, ice-cold hand!

Van Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs.
Harker today. About noon she got into a sort of lethargy
which we did not like. Although we kept silence to the
others, we were neither of us happy about it. She had been
restless all the morning, so that we were at first glad to
know that she was sleeping. When, however, her husband
mentioned casually that she was sleeping so soundly that he
could not wake her, we went to her room to see for ourselves.
She was breathing naturally and looked so well and peaceful
that we agreed that the sleep was better for her than any-
thing else. Poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is
no wonder that sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her
good.


Later.--Our opinion was justified, for when after a
refreshing sleep of some hours she woke up, she seemed
brighter and better than she had been for days. At sunset
she made the usual hypnotic report. Wherever he may be in
the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying to his destination. To
his doom, I trust!



26 October.--Another day and no tidings of the Czarina
Catherine. She ought to be here by now. That she is still
journeying somewhere is apparent, for Mrs. Harker's hypnotic
report at sunrise was still the same. It is possible that
the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog. Some of the
steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog
both to north and south of the port. We must continue our
watching, as the ship may now be signalled any moment.


27 October, Noon.--Most strange. No news yet of the
ship we wait for. Mrs. Harker reported last night and this
morning as usual. "Lapping waves and rushing water," though
she added that "the waves were very faint." The telegrams
from London have been the same, "no further report." Van
Helsing is terribly anxious, and told me just now that he
fears the Count is escaping us.

He added significantly, "I did not like that lethargy
of Madam Mina's. Souls and memories can do strange things
during trance." I was about to as k him more, but Harker
just then came in, and he held up a warning hand. We must
try tonight at sunset to make her speak more fully when in
her hypnotic state.

28 October.--Telegram. Rufus Smith, London, to Lord
Godalming, care H. B. M. Vice Consul, Varna

"Czarina Catherine reported entering Galatz at one
o'clock today."




DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


28 October.--When the telegram came announcing the
arrival in Galatz I do not think it was such a shock to any
of us as might have been expected. True, we did not know
whence, or how, or when, the bolt would come. But I think we
all expected that something strange would happen. The day of
arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied that things
would not be just as we had expected. We only waited to learn
where the change would occur. None the less, however, it was
a surprise. I suppose that nature works on such a hopeful
basis that we believe against ourselves that things will be
as they ought to be, not as we should know that they will be.
Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels, even if it be a
will-o'-the-wisp to man. Van Helsing raised his hand over
his head for a moment, as though in remonstrance with the
Almighty. But he said not a word, and in a few seconds stood
up with his face sternly set.

Lord Godalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heav-
ily. I was myself half stunned and looked in wonder at one
after another. Quincey Morris tightened his belt with that
quick movement which I knew so well. In our old wandering
days it meant "action." Mrs. Harker grew ghastly white, so
that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded
her hands meekly and looked up in prayer. Harker smiled,
actually smiled, the dark, bitter smile of one who is without
hope, but at the same time his action belied his words, for
his hands instinctively sought the hilt of the great Kukri
knife and rested there.

"When does the next train start for Galatz?" said Van
Helsing to us generally.

"At 6:30 tomorrow morning!" We all started, for the
answer came from Mrs. Harker.

"How on earth do you know?" said Art.

"You forget, or perhaps you do not know, though Jona-
than does and so does Dr. Van Helsing, that I am the train
fiend. At home in Exeter I always used to make up the time
tables, so as to be helpful to my husband. I found it so
useful sometimes, that I always make a study of the time
tables now. I knew that if anything were to take us to
Castle Dracula we should go by Galatz, or at any rate
through Bucharest, so I learned the times very carefully.
Unhappily there are not many to learn, as the only train
tomorrow leaves as I say."

"Wonderful woman!" murmured the Professor.

"Can't we get a special?" asked Lord Godalming.

Van Helsing shook his head, "I fear not. This land is
very different from yours or mine. Even if we did have a
special, it would probably not arrive as soon as our regular
train. Moreover, we have something to prepare. We must think.
Now let us organize. You, friend Arthur, go to the train and
get the tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go
in the morning. Do you, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of
the ship and get from him letters to the agent in Galatz,
with authority to make a search of the ship just as it was
here. Quincey Morris, you see the Vice Consul, and get his
aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our
way smooth, so that no times be lost when over the Danube.
John will stay with Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult.
For so if time be long you may be delayed. And it will not
matter when the sun set, since I am here with Madam to make
report."

"And I," said Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her
old self than she had been for many a long day, "shall try
to be of use in all ways, and shall think and write for you
as I used to do. Something is shifting from me in some
strange way, and I feel freer than I have been of late!"

The three younger men looked happier at the moment as
they seemed to realize the significance of her words. But
Van Helsing and I, turning to each other, met each a grave
and troubled glance. We said nothing at the time, however.

When the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Hel-
sing asked Mrs. Harker to look up the copy of the diaries and
find him the part of Harker's journal at the Castle. She went
away to get it.

When the door was shut upon her he said to me, "We
mean the same! Speak out!"

"Here is some change. It is a hope that makes me sick,
for it may deceive us."

"Quite so. Do you know why I asked her to get the
manuscript?"

"No!" said I, "unless it was to get an opportunity of
seeing me alone."

"You are in part right, friend John, but only in part.
I want to tell you something. And oh, my friend, I am
taking a great, a terrible, risk. But I believe it is right.
In the moment when Madam Mina said those words that arrest
both our understanding, an inspiration came to me. In the
trance of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to
read her mind. Or more like he took her to see him in his
earth box in the ship with water rushing, just as it go free
at rise and set of sun. He learn then that we are here, for
she have more to tell in her open life with eyes to see ears
to hear than he, shut as he is, in his coffin box. Now he
make his most effort to escape us.  At present he want her not.

"He is sure with his so great knowledge that she will
come at his call. But he cut her off, take her, as he can
do, out of his own power, that so she come not to him. Ah!
There I have hope that our man brains that have been of man
so long and that have not lost the grace of God, will come
higher than his child-brain that lie in his tomb for centur-
ies, that grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work
selfish and therefore small. Here comes Madam Mina. Not a
word to her of her trance! She knows it not, and it would
overwhelm her and make despair just when we want all her
hope, all her courage, when most we want all her great brain
which is trained like man's brain, but is of sweet woman and
have a special power which the Count give her, and which he
may not take away altogether, though he think not so. Hush!
Let me speak, and you shall learn. Oh, John, my friend, we
are in awful straits. I fear, as I never feared before. We
can only trust the good God. Silence! Here she comes!"

I thought that the Professor was going to break down
and have hysterics, just as he had when Lucy died, but with a
great effort he controlled himself and was at perfect
nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped into the room, bright
and happy looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly for-
getful of her misery. As she came in, she handed a number of
sheets of typewriting to Van Helsing. He looked over them
gravely, his face brightening up as he read.

Then holding the pages between his finger and thumb he
said, "Friend John, to you with so much experience already,
and you too, dear Madam Mina, that are young, here is a
lesson. Do not fear ever to think. A half thought has been
buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to let him loose his
wings. Here now, with more knowledge, I go back to where
that half thought come from and I find that he be no half
thought at all. That be a whole thought, though so young that
he is not yet strong to use his little wings. Nay, like the
`Ugly Duck' of my friend Hans Andersen, he be no duck thought
at all, but a big swan thought that sail nobly on big wings,
when the time come for him to try them. See I read here what
Jonathan have written.

"That other of his race who, in a later age, again and
again, brought his forces over The Great River into Turkey
Land, who when he was beaten back, came again, and again,
and again, though he had to come alone from the bloody field
where his troops were being slaughtered, since he knew that
he alone could ultimately triumph.

"What does this tell us? Not much? No! The Count's
child thought see nothing, therefore he speak so free. Your
man thought see nothing. My man thought see nothing, till
just now. No! But there comes another word from some one
who speak without thought because she, too, know not what it
mean, what it might mean. Just as there are elements which
rest, yet when in nature's course they move on their way and
they touch, the pouf! And there comes a flash of light,
heaven wide, that blind and kill and destroy some. But that
show up all earth below for leagues and leagues. Is it not
so? Well, I shall explain. To begin, hav e you ever study
the philosophy of crime? `Yes' and `No.' You, John, yes,
for it is a study of insanity. You, no, Madam Mina, for
crime touch you not, not but once. Still, your mind works
true, and argues not a particulari ad universale. There is
this peculiarity in criminals. It is so constant, in all
countries and at all times, that even police, who know not
much from philosophy, come to know it empirically, that it
is. That is to be empiric. The criminal always work at one
crime, that is the true criminal who seems predestinate to
crime, and who will of none other. This criminal has not full
man brain. He is clever and cunning and resourceful, but he
be not of man stature as to brain. He be of child brain in
much. Now this criminal of ours is pre-destinate to crime
also. He, too, have child brain, and it is of the child to
do what he have done. The little bird, the little fish, the
little animal learn not by principle, but empirically. And
when he learn to do, then there is to him the ground to start
from to do more. `Dos pou sto,' said Archimedes. `Give me
a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!' To do once, is the
fulcrum whereby child brain become man brain. And until he
have the purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again
every time, just as he have done before! Oh, my dear, I see
that your eyes are opened, and that to you the lightning
flash show all the leagues, "for Mrs. Harker began to clap her
hands and her eyes sparkled.

He went on, "Now you shall speak. Tell us two dry men
of science what you see with those so bright eyes." He took
her hand and held it whilst he spoke. His finger and thumb
closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively and uncon-
sciously, as she spoke.

"The Count is a criminal and of criminal type. Nordau
and Lombroso would so classify him, and qua criminal he is
of an imperfectly formed mind. Thus, in a difficulty he has
to seek resource in habit. His past is a clue, and the one
page of it that we know, and that from his own lips, tells
that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a`tight
place,' he went back to his own country from the land he had
tried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared
himself for a new effort. He came again better equipped for
his work, and won. So he came to London to invade a new land.
He was beaten, and when all hope of success was lost, and his
existence in danger, he fled back over the sea to his home.
Just as formerly he had fled back over the Danube from
Turkey Land."

"Good, good! Oh, you so clever lady!" said Van Helsing,
enthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand.  A moment
later he said to me, as calmly as though we had been having
a sick room consultation, "Seventy-two only, and in all this
excitement. I have hope."

Turning to her again, he said with keen expectation,
"But go on. Go on! There is more to tell if you will. Be
not afraid. John and I know. I do in any case, and shall
tell you if you are right. Speak, without fear!"

"I will try to. But you will forgive me if I seem too
egotistical."

"Nay! Fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you
that we think."

"Then, as he is criminal he is selfish. And as his
intellect is small and his action is based on selfishness, he
confines himself to one purpose. That purpose is remorseless.
As he fled back over the Danube, leaving his forces to be cut
to pieces, so now he is intent on being safe, careless of all.
So his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat from the terr-
ible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful night.
I felt it! Oh, I felt it! Thank God, for His great mercy!
My soul is freer than it has been since that awful hour. And
all that haunts me is a fear lest in some trance or dream he
may have used my knowledge for his ends."

The Professor stood up, "He has so used your mind, and
by it he has left us here in Varna, whilst the ship that
carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to Galatz,
where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from
us. But his child mind only saw so far. And it may be that
as ever is in God's Providence, the very thing that the evil
doer most reckoned on for his selfish good, turns out to be
his chiefest harm. The hunter is taken in his own snare, as
the great Psalmist says. For now that he think he is free
from every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us with
so many hours to him, then his selfish child brain will
whisper him to sleep. He think, too, that as he cut himself
off from knowing your mind, there can be no knowledge of him
to you. There is where he fail! That terrible baptism of
blood which he give you makes you free to go to him in
spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom,
when the sun rise and set. At such times you go by my voli-
tion and not by his. And this power to good of you and
others, you have won from your suffering at his hands. This
is now all more precious that he know it not, and to guard
himself have even cut himself off from his knowledge of our
where. We, however, are not selfish, and we believe that God
is with us through all this blackness, and these many dark
hours. We shall follow him, and we shall not flinch. Even if
we peril ourselves that we become like him. Friend John,
this has been a great hour, and it have done much to advance
us on our way. You must be scribe and write him all down, so
that when the others return from their work you can give it
to them, then they shall know as we do."

And so I have written it whilst we wait their return,
and Mrs. Harker has written with the typewriter all since
she brought the MS to us.





CHAPTER 26


DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


29 October.--This is written in the train from Varna to
Galatz. Last night we all assembled a little before the
time of sunset. Each of us had done his work as well as he
could, so far as thought, and endeavor, and opportunity go,
we are prepared for the whole of our journey, and for our
work when we get to Galatz. When the usual time came round
Mrs. Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort, and
after a longer and more serious effort on the part of Van
Helsing than has been usually necessary, she sank into the
trance. Usually she speaks on a hint, but this time the
Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty
resolutely, before we could learn anything. At last her
answer came.

"I can see nothing. We are still. There are no waves
lapping, but only a steady swirl of water softly running
against the hawser. I can hear men's voices calling, near
and far, and the roll and creak of oars in the rowlocks. A
gun is fired somewhere, the echo of it seems far away. There
is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are drag-
ged along. What is this? There is a gleam of light. I can
feel the air blowing upon me."

Here she stopped. She had risen, as if impulsively,
from where she lay on the sofa, and raised both her hands,
palms upwards, as if lifting a weight. Van Helsing and I
looked at each other with understanding. Quincey raised his
eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst Harker's
hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri. There
was a long pause. We all knew that the time when she could
speak was passing, but we felt that it was useless to say
anything.

Suddenly she sat up, and as she opened her eyes said
sweetly, "Would none of you like a cup of tea? You must all
be so tired!"

We could only make her happy, and so acqueisced. She
bustled off to get tea. When she had gone Van Helsing said,
"You see, my friends. He is close to land. He has left his
earth chest. But he has yet to get on shore. In the night
he may lie hidden somewhere, but if he be not carried on
shore, or if the ship do not touch it, he cannot achieve the
land. In such case he can, if it be in the night, change his
form and jump or fly on shore, then, unless he be carried he
cannot escape. And if he be carried, then the customs men
may discover what the box contain. Thus, in fine, if he
escape not on shore tonight, or before dawn, there will be
the whole day lost to him. We may then arrive in time. For
if he escape not at night we shall come on him in daytime,
boxed up and at our mercy. For he dare not be his true self,
awake and visible, lest he be discovered."

There was no more to be said, so we waited in patience
until the dawn, at which time we might learn more from Mrs.
Harker.

Early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety,
for her response in her trance. The hypnotic stage was even
longer in coming than before, and when it came the time re-
maining until full sunrise was so short that we began to
despair. Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole soul into the
effort. At last, in obedience to his will she made reply.

"All is dark. I hear lapping water, level with me, and
some creaking as of wood on wood." She paused, and the red
sun shot up. We must wait till tonight.

And so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in
an agony of expectation. We are due to arrive between two
and three in the morning. But already, at Bucharest, we
are three hours late, so we cannot possibly get in till well
after sunup. Thus we shall have two more hypnotic messages
from Mrs. Harker! Either or both may possibly throw more
light on what is happening.


Later.--Sunset has come and gone. Fortunately it came
at a time when there was no distraction. For had it occurred
whilst we were at a station, we might not have secured the
necessary calm and isolation. Mrs. Harker yielded to the
hypnotic influence even less readily than this morning. I
am in fear that her power of reading the Count's sensations
may die away, just when we want it most. It seems to me that
her imagination is beginning to work. Whilst she has been
in the trance hitherto she has confined herself to the simp-
lest of facts. If this goes on it may ultimately mislead us.
If I thought that the Count's power over her would die away
equally with her power of knowledge it would be a happy
thought. But I am afraid that it may not be so.

When she did speak, her words were enigmatical, "Some-
thing is going out. I can feel it pass me like a cold wind.
I can hear, far off, confused sounds, as of men talking in
strange tongues, fierce falling water, and the howling of
wolves." She stopped and a shudder ran through her, in-
creasing in intensity for a few seconds, till at the end,
she shook as though in a palsy. She said no more, even in
answer to the Professor's imperative questioning. When she
woke from the trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and lan-
guid, but her mind was all alert. She could not remember
anything, but asked what she had said. When she was told,
she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in silence.


30 October, 7 A.M.--We are near Galatz now, and I may
not have time to write later. Sunrise this morning was anx-
iously looked for by us all. Knowing of the increasing diff-
iculty of procuring the hypnotic trance, Van Helsing began
his passes earlier than usual. They produced no effect, how-
ever, until the regular time, when she yielded with a still
greater difficulty, only a minute before the sun rose. The
Professor lost no time in his questioning.

Her answer came with equal quickness, "All is dark. I
hear water swirling by, level with my ears, and the creaking
of wood on wood. Cattle low far off. There is another sound,
a queer one like. . ." She stopped and grew white, and
whiter still.

"Go on, go on! Speak, I command you!" said Van Helsing
in an agonized voice. At the same time there was despair in
his eyes, for the risen sun was reddening even Mrs. Harker's
pale face. She opened her eyes, and we all started as she
said, sweetly and seemingly with the utmost unconcern.

"Oh, Professor, why ask me to do what you know I can't?
I don't remember anything." Then, seeing the look of amaze-
ment on our faces, she said, turning from one to the other
with a troubled look, "What have I said? What have I done?
I know nothing, only that I was lying here, half asleep, and
heard you say `go on! speak, I command you!' It seemed so
funny to hear you order me about, as if I were a bad child!"

"Oh, Madam Mina," he said, sadly, "it is proof, if proof
be needed, of how I love and honor you, when a word for your
good, spoken more earnest than ever, can seem so strange be-
cause it is to order her whom I am proud to obey!"

The whistles are sounding. We are nearing Galatz. We are
on fire with anxiety and eagerness.

MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


30 October.--Mr. Morris took me to the hotel where our
rooms had been ordered by telegraph, he being the one who
could best be spared, since he does not speak any foreign
language. The forces were distributed much as they had been
at Varna, except that Lord Godalming went to the Vice Consul,
as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some
sort to the official, we being in extreme hurry. Jonathan and
the two doctors went to the shipping agent to learn partic-
ulars of the arrival of the Czarina Catherine.


Later.--Lord Godalming has returned. The Consul is away,
and the Vice Consul sick. So the routine work has been
attended to by a clerk. He was very obliging, and offered to
do anything in his power.





JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


30 October.--At nine o'clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward,
and I called on Messrs. Mackenzie & Steinkoff, the agents of
the London firm of Hapgood. They had received a wire from
London, in answer to Lord Godalming's telegraphed request,
asking them to show us any civility in their power. They were
more than kind and courteous, and took us at once on board
the Czarina Catherine, which lay at anchor out in the river
harbor. There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name, who told
us of his voyage. He said that in all his life he had never
had so favorable a run.

"Man!" he said, "but it made us afeard, for we expect
it that we should have to pay for it wi' some rare piece o'
ill luck, so as to keep up the average. It's no canny to run
frae London to the Black Sea wi' a wind ahint ye, as though
the Deil himself were blawin' on yer sail for his ain pur-
pose. An' a' the time we could no speer a thing. Gin we were
nigh a ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell on us and
travelled wi' us, till when after it had lifted and we looked
out, the deil a thing could we see. We ran by Gibraltar wi'
oot bein' able to signal. An' til we came to the Dardanelles
and had to wait to get our permit to pass, we never were
within hail o' aught. At first I inclined to slack off sail
and beat about till the fog was lifted. But whiles, I thocht
that if the Deil was minded to get us into the Black Sea
quick, he was like to do it whether we would or no. If we had
a quick voyage it would be no to our miscredit wi'the owners,
or no hurt to our traffic, an' the Old Mon who had served his
ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no hinderin'
him."

This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition
and commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said, "Mine
friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought by some,
and he know when he meet his match!"

The skipper was not displeased with the compliment, and
went on, "When we got past the Bosphorus the men began to
grumble. Some o' them, the Roumanians, came and asked me to
heave overboard a big box which had been put on board by a
queer lookin' old man just before we had started frae London.
I had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twa
fingers when they saw him, to guard them against the evil eye.
Man! but the supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly ri-
deeculous! I sent them aboot their business pretty quick,
but as just after a fog closed in on us I felt a wee bit as
they did anent something, though I wouldn't say it was again
the big box. Well, on we went, and as the fog didn't let up
for five days I joost let the wind carry us, for if the Deil
wanted to get somewheres, well, he would fetch it up a'reet.
An' if he didn't, well, we'd keep a sharp lookout anyhow.
Sure eneuch, we had a fair way and deep water all the time.
And two days ago, when the mornin' sun came through the fog,
we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz. The
Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take
out the box and fling it in the river. I had to argy wi'
them aboot it wi' a handspike. An' when the last o' them
rose off the deck wi' his head in his hand, I had convinced
them that, evil eye or no evil eye, the property and the
trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the river
Danube. They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to
fling in, and as it was marked Galatz via Varna, I thocht I'd
let it lie till we discharged in the port an' get rid o't
althegither. We didn't do much clearin' that day, an' had
to remain the nicht at anchor. But in the mornin', braw an'
airly, an hour before sunup, a man came aboard wi' an order,
written to him from England, to receive a box marked for one
Count Dracula. Sure eneuch the matter was one ready to his
hand. He had his papers a' reet, an' gla d I was to be rid
o' the dam' thing, for I was beginnin' masel' to feel uneasy
at it. If the Deil did have any luggage aboord the ship, I'm
thinkin' it was nane ither than that same!"

"What was the name of the man who took it?" asked Dr.
Van Helsing with restrained eagerness.

"I'll be tellin' ye quick!" he answered, and stepping
down to his cabin, produced a receipt signed "Immanuel
Hildesheim." Burgen-strasse 16 was the address. We found
out that this was all the Captain knew, so with thanks we
came away.

We found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather
the Adelphi Theatre type, with a nose like a sheep, and a
fez. His arguments were pointed with specie, we doing the
punctuation, and with a little bargaining he told us what
he knew. This turned out to be simple but important. He
had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, telling
him to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid
customs, a box which would arrive at Galatz in the Czarina
Catherine. This he was to give in charge to a certain
Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the Slovaks who traded down
the river to the port. He had been paid for his work by an
English bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at
the Danube International Bank. When Skinsky had come to him,
he had taken him to the ship and handed over the box, so as
to save parterage. That was all he knew.

We then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him.
One of his neighbors, who did not seem to bear him any affec-
tion, said that he had gone away two days before, no one knew
whither. This was corroborated by his landlord, who had re-
ceived by messenger the key of the house together with the
rent due, in English money. This had been between ten and
eleven o'clock last night. We were at a standstill again.

Whilst we were talking one came running and breathless-
ly gasped out that the body of Skinsky had been found inside
the wall of the churchyard of St. Peter, and that the throat
had been torn open as if by some wild animal. Those we had
been speaking with ran off to see the horror, the women cry-
ing out. "This is the work of a Slovak!" We hurried away
lest we should have been in some way drawn into the affair,
and so detained.

As we came home we could arrive at no definite conclu-
sion. We were all convinced that the box was on its way, by
water, to somewhere, but where that might be we would have to
discover. With heavy hearts we came home to the hotel to Mina.

When we met together, the first thing was to consult as
to taking Mina again into our confidence. Things are getting
desperate, and it is at least a chance, though a hazardous
one. As a preliminary step, I was released from my promise
to her.





MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


30 October, evening.--They were so tired and worn out
and dispirited that there was nothing to be done till they
had some rest, so I asked them all to lie down for half an
hour whilst I should enter everything up to the moment. I
feel so grateful to the man who invented the "Traveller's"
typewriter, and to Mr. Morris for getting this one for me.
I should have felt quite astray doing the work if I had to
write with a pen. . .

It is all done. Poor dear, dear Jonathan, what he must
have suffered, what he must be suffering now. He lies on the
sofa hardly seeming to breathe, and his whole body appears in
collapse. His brows are knit. His face is drawn with pain.
Poor fellow, maybe he is thinking, and I can see his face all
wrinkled up with the concentration of his thoughts. Oh! if I
could only help at all. I shall do what I can.

I have asked Dr. Van Helsing, and he has got me all the
papers that I have not yet seen. Whilst they are resting, I
shall go over all carefully, and perhaps I may arrive at some
conclusion. I shall try to follow the Professor's example,
and think without prejudice on the facts before me. . .

I do believe that under God's providence I have made a
discovery. I shall get the maps and look over them.

I am more than ever sure that I am right. My new con-
clusion is ready, so I shall get our party together and read
it. They can judge it. It is well to be accurate, and
every minute is precious.





MINA HARKER'S MEMORANDUM

(ENTERED IN HER JOURNAL)


Ground of inquiry.--Count Dracula's problem is to get
back to his own place.

(a) He must be brought back by some one. This is
evident. For had he power to move himself as he wished he
could go either as man, or wolf, or bat, or in some other
way. He evidently fears discovery or interference, in the
state of helplessness in which he must be, confined as he is
between dawn and sunset in his wooden box.

(b) How is he to be taken?--Here a process of exclu-
sions may help us. By road, by rail, by water?

1. By Road.--There are endless difficulties, especi-
ally in leaving the city.

(x) There are people. And people are curious, and
investigate. A hint, a surmise, a doubt as to what might be
in the box, would destroy him.

(y) There are, or there may be, customs and octroi
officers to pass.

(z) His pursuers might follow. This is his highest
fear. And in order to prevent his being betrayed he has
repelled, so far as he can, even his victim, me!

2. By Rail.--There is no one in charge of the box. It
would have to take its chance of being delayed, and delay
would be fatal, with enemies on the track. True, he might
escape at night. But what would he be, if left in a strange
place with no refuge that he could fly to? This is not what
he intends, and he does not mean to risk it.

3. By Water.--Here is the safest way, in one respect,
but with most danger in another. On the water he is power-
less except at night. Even then he can only summon fog and
storm and snow and his wolves. But were he wrecked, the
living water would engulf him, helpless, and he would indeed
be lost. He could have the vessel drive to land, but if it
were unfriendly land, wherein he was not free to move, his
position would still be desperate.

We know from the record that he was on the water, so
what we have to do is to ascertain what water.

The first thing is to realize exactly what he has done
as yet. We may, then, get a light on what his task is to be.

Firstly.--We must differentiate between what he did in
London as part of his general plan of action, when he was
pressed for moments and had to arrange as best he could.

Secondly we must see, as well as we can surmise it from
the facts we know of, what he has done here.

As to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at
Galatz, and sent invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we
should ascertain his means of exit from England. His immed-
iate and sole purpose then was to escape. The proof of this,
is the letter of instructions sent ot Immanuel Hildesheim to
clear and take away the box before sunrise. There is also the
instruction to Petrof Skinsky. These we must only guess at,
but there must have been some letter or message, since Skin-
sky came to Hildesheim.

That, so far, his plans were successful we know. The
Czarina Catherine made a phenomenally quick journey. So much
so that Captain Donelson's suspicions were aroused. But his
superstition united with his canniness played the Count's
game for him, and he ran with his favoring wind through fogs
and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz. That the
Count's arrangements were well made, has been proved. Hilde-
sheim cleared the box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky.
Skinsky took it, and here we lose the trail. We only know
that the box is somewhere on the water, moving along. The
customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been avoided.

Now we come to what the Count must have done after his
arrival, on land, at Galatz.

The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise. At sun-
rise the Count could appear in his own form. Here, we ask
why Skinsky was chosen at all to aid in the work? In my
husband's diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing with the
Slovaks who trade down the river to the port. And the man's
remark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the
general feeling against his class. The Count wanted iso-
lation.

My surmise is this, that in London the Count decided
to get back to his castle by water, as the most safe and
secret way. He was brought from the castle by Szgany, and
probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks who took the
boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped to London. Thus
the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange
this service. When the box was on land, before sunrise or
after sunset, he came out from his box, met Skinsky and
instructed him what to do as to arranging the carriage of
the box up some river. When this was done, and he knew that
all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought,
by murdering his agent.

I have examined the map and find that the river most
suitable for the Slovaks to have ascended is either the
Pruth or the Sereth. I read in the typescript that in my
trance I heard cows low and water swirling level with my
ears and the creaking of wood. The Count in his box, then,
was on a river in an open boat, propelled probably either
by oars or poles, for the banks are near and it is working
against stream. There would be no such if floating down
stream.

Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth,
but we may possibly investigate further. Now of these two,
the Pruth is the more easily navigated, but the Sereth is,
at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza which runs up round the
Borgo Pass. The loop it makes is manifestly as close to
Dracula's castle as can be got by water.


MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL--CONTINUED


When I had done reading, Jonathan took me in his arms
and kissed me. The others kept shaking me by both hands,
and Dr. Van Helsing said, "Our dear Madam Mina is once more
our teacher. Her eyes have been where we were blinded. Now
we are on the track once again, and this time we may succeed.
Our enemy is at his most helpless. And if we can come on him
by day, on the water, our task will be over. He has a start,
but he is powerless to hasten, as he may not leave this box
lest those who carry him may suspect. For them to suspect
would be to prompt them to throw him in the stream where he
perish. This he knows, and will not. Now men, to our Council
of War, for here and now, we must plan what each and all
shall do."

"I shall get a steam launch and follow him," said Lord
Godalming.

"And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he
land," said Mr. Morris.

"Good!" said the Professor, "both good. But neither
must go alone. There must be force to overcome force if
need be. The Slovak is strong and rough, and he carries
rude arms." All the men smiled, for amongst them they
carried a small arsenal.

Said Mr. Morris, "I have brought some Winchesters.
They are pretty handy in a crowd, and there may be wolves.
The Count, if you remember, took some other precautions. He
made some requisitions on others that Mrs. Harker could not
quite hear or understand. We must be ready at all points."

Dr. Seward said, "I think I had better go with Quincey.
We have been accustomed to hunt together, and we two, well
armed, will be a match for whatever may come along. You must
not be alone, Art. It may be necessary to fight the Slovaks,
and a chance thrust, for I don't suppose these fellows carry
guns, would undo all our plans. There must be no chances, this
time. We shall not rest until the Count's head and body
have been separated, and we are sure that he cannot rein-
carnate."

He looked at Jonathan as he spoke, and Jonathan looked
at me. I could see that the poor dear was torn about in his
mind. Of course he wanted to be with me. But then the boat
service would, most likely, be the one which would destroy
the. . .the. . .Vampire. (Why did I hesitate to write the word?)

He was silent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van
Helsing spoke, "Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice
reasons. First, because you are young and brave and can
fight, and all energies may be needed at the last. And again
that it is your right to destroy him. That, which has wrought
such woe to you and yours. Be not afraid for Madam Mina. She
will be my care, if I may. I am old. My legs are not so
quick to run as once. And I am not used to ride so long or
to pursue as need be, or to fight with lethal weapons. But
I can be of other service. I can fight in other way. And I
can die, if need be, as well as younger men. Now let me say
that what I would is this. While you, my Lord Godalming and
friend Jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the
river, and whilst John and Quincey guard the bank where per-
chance he might be landed, I will take Madam Mina right into
the heart of the enemy's country. Whilst the old fox is tied
in his box, floating on the running stream whence he cannot
escape to land, where he dares not raise the lid of his cof-
fin box lest his Slovak carriers should in fear leave him to
perish, we shall go in the track where Jonathan went, from
Bistritz over the Borgo, and find our way to the Castle of
Dracula. Here, Madam Mina's hypnotic power will surely help,
and we shall find our way, all dark and unknown otherwise,
after the first sunrise when we are near that fateful place.
There is much to be done, and other places to be made sanc-
tify, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated."

Here Jonathan interrupted him hotly, "Do you mean to
say, Professor Van Helsing, that you would bring Mina, in
her sad case and tainted as she is with that devil's illness,
right into the jaws of his deathtrap? Not for the world! Not
for Heaven or Hell!"

He became almost speechless for a minute, and then went
on, "Do you know what the place is? Have you seen that awful
den of hellish infamy, with the very moonlight alive with
grisly shapes, and ever speck of dust that whirls in the wind
a devouring monster in embryo? Have you felt the Vampire's
lips upon your throat?"

Here he turned to me, and as his eyes lit on my fore-
head he threw up his arms with a cry, "Oh, my God, what have
we done to have this terror upon us?" and he sank down on
the sofa in a collapse of misery.

The Professor's voice, as he spoke in clear, sweet tones,
which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed us all.

"Oh, my friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina
from that awful place that I would go. God forbid that I
should take her into that place. There is work, wild work,
to be done before that place can be purify. Remember that
we are in terrible straits. If the Count escape us this
time, and he is strong and subtle and cunning, he may choose
to sleep him for a century, and then in time our dear one,"
he took my hand, "would come to him to keep him company, and
would be as those others that you, Jonathan, saw. You have
told us of their gloating lips. You heard their ribald laugh
as they clutched the moving bag that the Count threw to them.
You shudder, and well may it be. Forgive me that I make you
so much pain, but it is necessary. My friend, is it not a
dire need for that which I am giving, possibly my life? If
it, were that any one went into that place to stay, it is I
who would have to go to keep them company."

"Do as you will," said Jonathan, with a sob that shook
him all over, "we are in the hands of God!"


Later.--Oh, it did me good to see the way that these
brave men worked. How can women help loving men when they
are so earnest, and so true, and so brave! And, too, it
made me think of the wonderful power of money! What can it
not do when basely used. I felt so thankful that Lord Godal-
ming is rich, and both he and Mr. Morris, who also has plenty
of money, are willing to spend it so freely. For if they did
not, our little expedition could not start, either so promptly
or so well equipped, as it will within another hour. It is
not three hours since it was arranged what part each of us
was to do. And now Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a lovely
steam launch, with steam up ready to start at a moment's
notice. Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris have half a dozen good
horses, well appointed. We have all the maps and appliances
of various kinds that can be had. Professor Van Helsing and
I are to leave by the 11:40 train tonight for Veresti, where
we are to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass. We are
bringing a good deal of ready money, as we are to buy a carr-
iage and horses. We shall drive ourselves, for we have no
one whom we can trust in the matter. The Professor knows
something of a great many languages, so we shall get on all
right. We have all got arms, even for me a large bore revol-
ver. Jonathan would not be happy unless I was armed like
the rest. Alas! I cannot carry one arm that the rest do,
the scar on my forehead forbids that. Dear Dr. Van Helsing
comforts me by telling me that I am fully armed as there may
be wolves. The weather is getting colder every hour, and
there are snow flurries which come and go as warnings.


Later.--It took all my courage to say goodby to my dar-
ling. We may never meet again. Courage, Mina! The Pro-
fessor is looking at you keenly. His look is a warning.
There must be no tears now, unless it may be that God will
let them fall in gladness.





JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


30 October, night.--I am writing this in the light from
the furnace door of the steam launch. Lord Godalming is
firing up. He is an experienced hand at the work, as he has
had for years a launch of his own on the Thames, and another
on the Norfolk Broads. Regarding our plans, we finally de-
cided that Mina's guess was correct, and that if any waterway
was chosen for the Count's escape back to his Castle, the
Sereth and then the Bistritza at its junction, would be the
one. We took it, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north
latitude, would be the place chosen for crossing the country
between the river and the Carpathians. We have no fear in
running at good speed up the river at night. There is plenty
of water, and the banks are wide enough apart to make steam-
ing, even in the dark, easy enough. Lord Godalming tells me
to sleep for a while, as it is enough for the present for one
to be on watch. But I cannot sleep, how can I with the terr-
ible danger hanging over my darling, and her going out into
that awful place. . .

My only comfort is that we are in the hands of God. Only
for that faith it would be easier to die than to live, and so
be quit of all the trouble. Mr. Morris and Dr. Seward were
off on their long ride before we started. They are to keep up
the right bank, far enough off to get on higher lands where
they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following
of its curves. They have, for the first stages, two men to
ride and lead their spare horses, four in all, so as not to
excite curiosity. When they dismiss the men, which shall be
shortly, they shall themselves look after the horses. It may
be necessary for us to join forces. If so they can mount our
whole party. One of the saddles has a moveable horn, and can
be easily adapted for Mina, if required.

It is a wild adventure we are on. Here, as we are
rushing along through the darkness, with the cold from the
river seeming to rise up and strike us, with all the myster-
ious voices of the night around us, it all comes home. We seem
to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways. Into a
whole world of dark and dreadful things. Godalming is shut-
ting the furnace door. . .


31 October.--Still hurrying along. The day has come, and
Godalming is sleeping. I am on watch. The morning is bitterly
cold, the furnace heat is grateful, though we have heavy fur
coats. As yet we have passed only a few open boats, but none
of them had on board any box or package of anything like the
size of the one we seek. The men were scared every time we
turned our electric lamp on them, and fell on their knees and
prayed.


1 November, evening.--No news all day. We have found
nothing of the kind we seek. We have now passed into the
Bistritza, and if we are wrong in our surmise our chance is
gone. We have overhauled every boat, big and little. Early
this morning, one crew took us for a Government boat, and
treated us accordingly. We saw in this a way of smoothing
matters, so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth,
we got a Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously. With
every boat which we have over-hauled since then this trick
has succeeded. We have had every deference shown to us, and
not once any objection to whatever we chose to ask or do.
Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them, go-
ing at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on
board. This was before they came to Fundu, so they could not
tell us whether the boat turned into the Bistritza or contin-
ued on up the Sereth. At Fundu we could not hear of any such
boat, so she must have passed there in the night. I am feel-
ing very sleepy. The cold is perhaps beginning to tell upon
me, and nature must have rest some time. Godalming insists
that he shall keep the first watch. God bless him for all
his goodness to poor dear Mina and me.


2 November, morning.--It is broad daylight. That good
fellow would not wake me. He says it would have been a sin
to, for I slept peacefully and was forgetting my trouble. It
seems brutally selfish to me to have slept so long, and let
him watch all night, but he was quite right. I am a new man
this morning. And, as I sit here and watch him sleeping, I
can do all that is necessary both as to minding the engine,
steering, and keeping watch. I can feel that my strength
and energy are coming back to me. I wonder where Mina is
now, and Van Helsing. They should have got to Veresti about
noon on Wednesday. It would take them some time to get the
carriage and horses. So if they had started and travelled
hard, they would be about now at the Borgo Pass. God guide
and help them! I am afraid to think what may happen. If we
could only go faster. But we cannot. The engines are throb-
bing and doing their utmost. I wonder how Dr. Seward and Mr.
Morris are getting on. There seem to be endless streams run-
ning down the mountains into this river, but as none of them
are very large, at present, at all events, though they are
doubtless terrible in winter and when the snow melts, the
horsemen may not have met much obstruction. I hope that be-
fore we get to Strasba we may see them. For if by that time
we have not overtaken the Count, it may be necessary to take
counsel together what to do next.





DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


2 November.--Three days on the road. No news, and no
time to write it if there had been, for every moment is
precious. We have had only the rest needful for the horses.
But we are both bearing it wonderfully. Those adventurous
days of ours are turning up useful. We must push on. We
shall never feel happy till we get the launch in sight again.


3 Novenber.--We heard at Fundu that the launch had gone
up the Bistritza. I wish it wasn't so cold. There are signs
of snow coming. And if it falls heavy it will stop us. In
such case we must get a sledge and go on, Russian fashion.

4 Novenber.--Today we heard of the launch having been
detained by an accident when trying to force a way up the
rapids. The Slovak boats get up all right, by aid of a rope
and steering with knowledge. Some went up only a few hours
before. Godalming is an amateur fitter himself, and evidently
it was he who put the launch in trim again.

Finally, they got up the rapids all right, with local
help, and are off on the chase afresh. I fear that the boat
is not any better for the accident, the peasantry tell us
that after she got upon smooth water again, she kept stopping
every now and again so long as she was in sight. We must push
on harder than ever. Our help may be wanted soon.





MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


31 October.--Arrived at Veresti at noon. The Professor
tells me that this morning at dawn he could hardly hypnotize
me at all, and that all I could say was, "dark and quiet."
He is off now buying a carriage and horses. He says that he
will later on try to buy additional horses, so that we may
be able to change them on the way. We have something more
than 70 miles before us. The country is lovely, and most
interesting. If only we were under different conditions,
how delightful it would be to see it all. If Jonathan and I
were driving through it alone what a pleasure it would be. To
stop and see people, and learn something of their life, and
to fill our minds and memories with all the color and pictur-
esqueness of the whole wild, beautiful country and the quaint
people! But, alas!


Later.--Dr. Van Helsing has returned. He has got the
carriage and horses. We are to have some dinner, and to
start in an hour. The landlady is putting us up a huge
basket of provisions. It seems enough for a company of
soldiers. The Professor encourages her, and whispers to me
that it may be a week before we can get any food again. He
has been shopping too, and has sent home such a wonderful
lot of fur coats and wraps, and all sorts of warm things.
There will not be any chance of our being cold.

We shall soon be off. I am afraid to think what may
happen to us. We are truly in the hands of God. He alone
knows what may be, and I pray Him, with all the strength of
my sad and humble soul, that He will watch over my beloved
husband. That whatever may happen, Jonathan may know that
I loved him and honored him more than I can say, and that my
latest and truest thought will be always for him.





CHAPTER 27


MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


1 November.--All day long we have travelled, and at a
good speed. The horses seem to know that they are being
kindly treated, for they go willingly their full stage at
best speed. We have now had so many changes and find the same
thing so constantly that we are encouraged to think that the
journey will be an easy one. Dr. Van Helsing is laconic, he
tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays
them well to make the exchange of horses. We get hot soup,
or coffee, or tea, and off we go. It is a lovely country.
Full of beauties of all imaginable kinds, and the people are
brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full of nice quali-
ties. They are very, very superstitious. In the first house
where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar
on my forehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers
towards me, to keep off the evil eye. I believe they went to
the trouble of putting an extra amount of garlic into our
food, and I can't abide garlic. Ever since then I have taken
care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have escaped
their suspicions. We are travelling fast, and as we have no
driver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal. But
I daresay that fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind
us all the way. The Professor seems tireless. All day he
would not take any rest, though he made me sleep for a long
spell.  At sunset time he hypnotized me, and he says I answered
as usual, "darkness, lapping water and creaking wood." So our
enemy is still on the river. I am afraid to think of Jona-
than, but somehow I have now no fear for him, or for myself.
I write this whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to
be ready. Dr. Van Helsing is sleeping. Poor dear, he looks
very tired and old and grey, but his mouth is set as firmly
as a conqueror's. Even in his sleep he is intense with res-
olution. When we have well started I must make him rest
whilst I drive. I shall tell him that we have days before us,
and he must not break down when most of all his strength
will be needed. . .All is ready. We are off shortly.


2 November, morning.--I was successful, and we took
turns driving all night. Now the day is on us, bright though
cold. There is a strange heaviness in the air. I say heav-
iness for want of a better word. I mean that it oppresses us
both. It is very cold, and only our warm furs keep us com-
fortable. At dawn Van Helsing hypnotized me. He says I ans-
wered "darkness, creaking wood and roaring water," so the
river is changing as they ascend. I do hope that my darling
will not run any chance of danger, more than need be, but we
are in God's hands.


2 November, night.--All day long driving. The country
gets wilder as we go, and the great spurs of the Carpathians,
which at Veresti seemed so far from us and so low on the
horizon, now seem to gather round us and tower in front. We
both seem in good spirits. I think we make an effort each to
cheer the other, in the doing so we cheer ourselves. Dr. Van
Helsing says that by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass.
The houses are very few here now, and the Professor says that
the last horse we got will have to go on with us, as we may
not be able to change. He got two in addition to the two we
changed, so that now we have a rude four-in-hand. The dear
horses are patient and good, and they give us no trouble. We
are not worried with other travellers, and so even I can
drive. We shall get to the Pass in daylight. We do not want
to arrive before. So we take it easy, and have each a long
rest in turn. Oh, what will tomorrow bring to us? We go to
seek the place where my poor darling suffered so much. God
grant that we may be guided aright, and that He will deign to
watch over my husband and those dear to us both, and who are
in such deadly peril.  As for me, I am not worthy in His sight.
Alas! I am unclean to His eyes, and shall be until He may
deign to let me stand forth in His sight as one of those who
have not incurred His wrath.





MEMORANDUM BY ABRAHAM VAN HELSING


4 November.--This to my old and true friend John Seward,
M. D., of Purefleet, London, in case I may not see him. It
may explain. It is morning, and I write by a fire which all
the night I have kept alive, Madam Mina aiding me. It is cold,
cold. So cold that the grey heavy sky is full of snow, which
when it falls will settle for all winter as the ground is
hardening to receive it. It seems to have affected Madam Mina.
She has been so heavy of head all day that she was not like
herself. She sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps! She who is usual
so alert, have done literally nothing all the day. She even
have lost her appetite. She make no entry into her little
diary, she who write so faithful at every pause. Something
whisper to me that all is not well. However, tonight she is
more vif. Her long sleep all day have refresh and restore her,
for now she is all sweet and bright as ever. At sunset I try
to hypnotize her, but alas! with no effect. The power has
grown less and less with each day, and tonight it fail me
altogether. Well, God's will be done, whatever it may be,
and whithersoever it may lead!

Now to the historical, for as Madam Mina write not in
her stenography, I must, in my cumbrous old fashion, that so
each day of us may not go unrecorded.

We got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday
morning. When I saw the signs of the dawn I got ready for
the hypnotism. We stopped our carriage, and got down so
that there might be no disturbance. I made a couch with
furs, and Madam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual, but
more slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic
sleep. As before, came the answer, "darkness and the swirl-
ing of water." Then she woke, bright and radiant and we go
on our way and soon reach the Pass. At this time and place,
she become all on fire with zeal. Some new guiding power be
in her manifested, for she point to a road and say, "This is
the way."

"How know you it?" I ask.

"Of course I know it,' she answer, and with a pause,
add, "Have not my Jonathan travelled it and wrote of his
travel?"

At first I think somewhat strange, but soon I see that
there be only one such byroad. It is used but little, and
very different from the coach road from the Bukovina to Bis-
tritz, which is more wide and hard, and more of use.

So we came down this road. When we meet other ways,
not always were we sure that they were roads at all, for
they be neglect and light snow have fallen, the horses know
and they only. I give rein to them, and they go on so patient.
By and by we find all the things which Jonathan have note in
that wonderful diary of him. Then we go on for long, long
hours and hours. At the first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep.
She try, and she succeed. She sleep all the time, till at the
last, I feel myself to suspicious grow, and attempt to wake
her. But she sleep on, and I may not wake her though I try.
I do not wish to try too hard lest I harm her. For I know
that she have suffer much, and sleep at times be all-in-all
to her. I think I drowse myself, for all of sudden I feel
guilt, as though I have done something. I find myself bolt
up, with the reins in my hand, and the good horses go along
jog, jog, just as ever. I look down and find Madam Mina still
asleep. It is now not far off sunset time, and over the snow
the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood, so that we
throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep.
For we are going up, and up, and all is oh, so wild and
rocky, as though it were the end of the world.

Then I arouse Madam Mina. This time she wake with not
much trouble, and then I try to put her to hypnotic sleep.
But she sleep not, being as though I were not. Still I try
and try, till all at once I find her and myself in dark, so
I look round, and find that the sun have gone down. Madam
Mina laugh, and I turn and look at her. She is now quite
awake, and look so well as I never saw her since that night
at Carfax when we first enter the Count's house. I am amaze,
and not at ease then. But she is so bright and tender and
thoughtful for me that I forget all fear. I light a fire,
for we have brought supply of wood with us, and she prepare
food while I undo the horses and set them, tethered in shel-
ter, to feed. Then when I return to the fire she have my
supper ready. I go to help her, but she smile, and tell me
that she have eat already. That she was so hungry that she
would not wait. I like it not, and I have grave doubts. But
I fear to affright her, and so I am silent of it. She help
me and I eat alone, and then we wrap in fur and lie beside
the fire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch.  But present-
ly I forget all of watching. And when I sudden remember that
I watch, I find her lying quiet, but awake, and looking at
me with so bright eyes. Once, twice more the same occur, and
I get much sleep till before morning. When I wake I try to
hypnotize her, but alas! Though she shut her eyes obedient,
she may not sleep. The sun rise up, and up, and up, and then
sleep come to her too late, but so heavy that she will not
wake. I have to lift her up, and place her sleeping in the
carriage when I have harnessed the horses and made all ready.
Madam still sleep, and she look in her sleep more healthy and
more redder than before. And I like it not. And I am afraid,
afraid, afraid! I am afraid of all things, even to think but
I must go on my way. The stake we play for is life and death,
or more than these, and we must not flinch.


5 November, morning.--Let me be accurate in everything,
for though you and I have seen some strange things together,
you may at the first think that I, Van Helsing, am mad. That
the many horrors and the so long strain on nerves has at the
last turn my brain.

All yesterday we travel, always getting closer to the
mountains, and moving into a more and more wild and desert
land. There are great, frowning precipices and much falling
water, and Nature seem to have held sometime her carnival.
Madam Mina still sleep and sleep. And though I did have hun-
ger and appeased it, I could not waken her, even for food. I
began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her,
tainted as she is with that Vampire baptism. "Well," said I
to myself, "if it be that she sleep all the day, it shall
also be that I do not sleep at night." As we travel on the
rough road, for a road of an ancient and imperfect kind there
was, I held down my head and slept.

Again I waked with a sense of guilt and of time passed,
and found Madam Mina still sleeping, and the sun low down.
But all was indeed changed. The frowning mountains seemed
further away, and we were near the top of a steep rising
hill, on summit of which was such a castle as Jonathan tell
of in his diary. At once I exulted and feared. For now, for
good or ill, the end was near.

I woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotize her, but
alas! unavailing till too late. Then, ere the great dark came
upon us, for even after down sun the heavens reflected the
gone sun on the snow, and all was for a time in a great twi-
light. I took out the horses and fed them in what shelter I
could. Then I make a fire, and near it I make Madam Mina,
now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid
her rugs. I got ready food, but she would not eat, simply
saying that she had not hunger. I did not press her, knowing
her unavailingness. But I myself eat, for I must needs now
be strong for all. Then, with the fear on me of what might
be, I drew a ring so big for her comfort, round where Madam
Mina sat. And over the ring I passed some of the wafer, and
I broke it fine so that all was well guarded. She sat still
all the time, so still as one dead. And she grew whiter and
even whiter till the snow was not more pale, and no word she
said. But when I drew near, she clung to me, and I could
know that the poor soul shook her from head to feet with a
tremor that was pain to feel.

I said to her presently, when she had grown more quiet,
"Will you not come over to the fire?" for I wished to make a
test of what she could. She rose obedient, but when she
have made a step she stopped, and stood as one stricken.

"Why not go on?" I asked. She shook her head, and coming
back, sat down in her place. Then, looking at me with open
eyes, as of one waked from sleep, she said simply, "I cannot!"
and remained silent. I rejoiced, for I knew that what she
could not, none of those that we dreaded could. Though there
might be danger to her body, yet her soul was safe!

Presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their
tethers till I came to them and quieted them. When they did
feel my hands on them, they whinnied low as in joy, and licked
at my hands and were quiet for a time. Many times through the
night did I come to them, till it arrive to the cold hour
when all nature is at lowest, and every time my coming was
with quiet of them. In the cold hour the fire began to die,
and I was about stepping forth to replenish it, for now the
snow came in flying sweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in
the dark there was a light of some kind, as there ever is
over snow, and it seemed as though the snow flurries and the
wreaths of mist took shape as of women with trailing gar-
ments. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses
whinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. I began
to fear, horrible fears. But then came to me the sense of
safety in that ring wherein I stood. I began too, to think
that my imaginings were of the night, and the gloom, and
the unrest that I have gone through, and all the terrible
anxiety. It was as though my memories of all Jonathan's
horrid experience were befooling me. For the snow flakes
and the mist began to wheel and circle round, till I could
get as though a shadowy glimpse of those women that would
have kissed him. And then the horses cowered lower and lower,
and moaned in terror as men do in pain. Even the madness of
fright was not to them, so that they could break away. I
feared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew
near and circled round. I looked at her, but she sat calm,
and smiled at me. When I would have stepped to the fire to
replenish it, she caught me and held me back, and whispered,
like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low it was.

"No! No! Do not go without. Here you are safe!"

I turned to her, and looking in her eyes said, "But
you? It is for you that I fear!"

Whereat she laughed, a laugh low and unreal, and said,
"Fear for me! Why fear for me? None safer in all the world
from them than I am," and as I wondered at the meaning of her
words, a puff of wind made the flame leap up, and I see the
red scar on her forehead. Then, alas! I knew. Did I not, I
would soon have learned, for the wheeling figures of mist
and snow came closer, but keeping ever without the Holy
circle. Then they began to materialize till, if God have not
taken away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes. There
were before me in actual flesh the same three women that Jon-
athan saw in the room, when they would have kissed his throat.
I knew the swaying round forms, the bright hard eyes, the
white teeth, the ruddy color, the voluptuous lips. They
smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina. And as their laugh came
through the silence of the night, they twined their arms and
pointed to her, and said in those so sweet tingling tones
that Jonathan said were of the intolerable sweetness of the
water glasses, "Come, sister. Come to us. Come!"

In fear I turned to my poor Madam Mina, and my heart
with gladness leapt like flame. For oh! the terror in her
sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my
heart that was all of hope. God be thanked she was not, yet
of them. I seized some of the firewood which was by me, and
holding out some of the Wafer, advanced on them towards the
fire. They drew back before me, and laughed their low horrid
laugh. I fed the fire, and feared them not. For I knew that
we were safe within the ring, which she could not leave no
more than they could enter. The horses had ceased to moan,
and lay still on the ground. The snow fell on them softly,
and they grew whiter. I knew that there was for the poor
beasts no more of terror.

And so we remained till the red of the dawn began to
fall through the snow gloom. I was desolate and afraid, and
full of woe and terror. But when that beautiful sun began
to climb the horizon life was to me again. At the first
coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the whirling
mist and snow. The wreaths of transparent gloom moved away
towards the castle, and were lost.

Instinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned to Madam
Mina, intending to hypnotize her. But she lay in a deep and
sudden sleep, from which I could not wake her. I tried to
hypnotize through her sleep, but she made no response, none
at all, and the day broke. I fear yet to stir. I have made
my fire and have seen the horses, they are all dead. Today
I have much to do here, and I keep waiting till the sun is up
high. For there may be places where I must go, where that
sunlight, though snow and mist obscure it, will be to me a
safety.

I will strengthen me with breakfast, and then I will do
my terrible work. Madam Mina still sleeps, and God be thanked!
She is calm in her sleep. . .





JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


4 November, evening.--The accident to the launch has
been a terrible thing for us. Only for it we should have
overtaken the boat long ago, and by now my dear Mina would
have been free. I fear to think of her, off on the wolds
near that horrid place. We have got horses, and we follow
on the track. I note this whilst Godalming is getting ready.
We have our arms. The Szgany must look out if they mean to
fight. Oh, if only Morris and Seward were with us. We must
only hope! If I write no more Goodby Mina! God bless and
keep you.

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


5 November.--With the dawn we saw the body of Szgany
before us dashing away from the river with their leiter
wagon. They surrounded it in a cluster, and hurried along
as though beset. The snow is falling lightly and there is
a strange excitement in the air. It may be our own feelings,
but the depression is strange. Far off I hear the howling of
wolves. The snow brings them down from the mountains, and
there are dangers to all of us, and from all sides. The horses
are nearly ready, and we are soon off. We ride to death of
some one. God alone knows who, or where, or what, or when,
or how it may be. . .





DR. VAN HELSING'S MEMORANDUM


5 November, afternoon.--I am at least sane. Thank God
for that mercy at all events, though the proving it has been
dreadful. When I left Madam Mina sleeping within the Holy
circle, I took my way to the castle. The blacksmith hammer
which I took in the carriage from Veresti was useful, though
the doors were all open I broke them off the rusty hinges,
lest some ill intent or ill chance should close them, so
that being entered I might not get out. Jonathan's bitter
experience served me here. By memory of his diary I found
my way to the old chapel, for I knew that here my work lay.
The air was oppressive. It seemed as if there was some
sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy. Either there
was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the howl of
wolves. Then I bethought me of my dear Madam Mina, and I was
in terrible plight. The dilemma had me between his horns.

Her, I had not dare to take into this place, but left
safe from the Vampire in that Holy circle. And yet even
there would be the wolf! I resolve me that my work lay here,
and that as to the wolves we must submit, if it were God's
will. At any rate it was only death and freedom beyond. So
did I choose for her. Had it but been for myself the choice
had been easy, the maw of the wolf were better to rest in
than the grave of the Vampire! So I make my choice to go on
with my work.

I knew that there were at least three graves to find,
graves that are inhabit. So I search, and search, and I
find one of them. She lay in her Vampire sleep, so full of
life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder as though I have
come to do murder. Ah, I doubt not that in the old time,
when such things were, many a man who set forth to do such a
task as mine, found at the last his heart fail him, and then
his nerve. So he delay, and delay, and delay, till the mere
beauty and the fascination of the wanton Undead have hypno-
tize him. And he remain on and on, till sunset come, and the
Vampire sleep be over. Then the beautiful eyes of the fair
woman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouth present to
a kiss, and the man is weak.  And there remain one more victim
in the Vampire fold. One more to swell the grim and grisly
ranks of the Undead!. . .

There is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by
the mere presence of such an one, even lying as she lay in a
tomb fretted with age and heavy with the dust of centuries,
though there be that horrid odor such as the lairs of the
Count have had. Yes, I was moved. I, Van Helsing, with all
my purpose and with my motive for hate. I was moved to a
yearning for delay which seemed to paralyze my faculties and
to clog my very soul. It may have been that the need of nat-
ural sleep, and the strange oppression of the air were be-
ginning to overcome me. Certain it was that I was lapsing
into sleep, the open eyed sleep of one who yields to a sweet
fascination, when there came through the snow stilled air a
long, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like
the sound of a clarion. For it was the voice of my dear
Madam Mina that I heard.

Then I braced myself again to my horrid task, and
found by wrenching away tomb tops one other of the sisters,
the other dark one. I dared not pause to look on her as I
had on her sister, lest once more I should begin to be en-
thrall. But I go on searching until, presently, I find in a
high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other
fair sister which, like Jonathan I had seen to gather herself
out of the atoms of the mist. She was so fair to look on, so
radiantly beautiful, so exquisitely voluptuous, that the very
instinct of man in me, which calls some of my sex to love and
to protect one of hers, made my head whirl with new emotion.
But God be thanked, that soul wail of my dear Madam Mina had
not died out of my ears. And, before the spell could be
wrought further upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work.
By this tim e I had searched all the tombs in the chapel, so
far as I could tell. And as there had been only three of
these Undead phantoms around us in the night, I took it that
there were no more of active Undead existent. There was one
great tomb more lordly than all the rest. Huge it was, and
nobly proportioned. On it was but one word.





DRACULA


This then was the Undead home of the King Vampire, to
whom so many more were due. Its emptiness spoke eloquent to
make certain what I knew. Before I began to restore these
women to their dead selves through my awful work, I laid in
Dracula's tomb some of the Wafer, and so banished him from
it, Undead, for ever.

Then began my terrible task, and I dreaded it. Had it
been but one, it had been easy, comparative. But three! To
begin twice more after I had been through a deed of horror.
For it was terrible with the sweet Miss Lucy, what would it
not be with these strange ones who had survived through cen-
turies, and who had been strenghtened by the passing of the
years. Who would, if they could, have fought for their foul
lives. . .

Oh, my friend John, but it was butcher work. Had I not
been nerved by thoughts of other dead, and of the living over
whom hung such a pall of fear, I could not have gone on. I
tremble and tremble even yet, though till all was over, God
be thanked, my nerve did stand. Had I not seen the repose in
the first place, and the gladness that stole over it just ere
the final dissolution came, as realization that the soul had
been won, I could not have gone further with my butchery. I
could not have endured the horrid screeching as the stake
drove home, the plunging of writhing form, and lips of bloody
foam. I should have fled in terror and left my work undone.
But it is over! And the poor souls, I can pity them now and
weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of
death for a short moment ere fading. For, friend John, hardly
had my knife severed the head of each, before the whole body
began to melt away and crumble into its native dust, as
though the death that should have come centuries agone had
at last assert himself and say at once and loud, "I am here!"

Before I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that
never more can the Count enter there Undead.

When I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept,
she woke from her sleep and, seeing me, cried out in pain
that I had endured too much.

"Come!" she said, "come away from this awful place! Let
us go to meet my husband who is, I know, coming towards us."
She was looking thin and pale and weak. But her eyes were
pure and glowed with fervor. I was glad to see her paleness
and her illness, for my mind was full of the fresh horror of
that ruddy vampire sleep.

And so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go
eastward to meet our friends, and him, whom Madam Mina tell
me that she know are coming to meet us.





MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


6 November.--It was late in the afternoon when the Pro-
fessor and I took our way towards the east whence I knew
Jonathan was coming. We did not go fast, though the way was
steeply downhill, for w e had to take heavy rugs and wraps
with us. We dared not face the possibility of being left
without warmth in the cold and the snow. We had to take some
of our provisions too, for we were in a perfect desolation,
and so far as we could see through the snowfall, there was
not even the sign of habitation. When we had gone about a
mile, I was tired with the heavy walking and sat down to rest.
Then we looked back and saw where the clear line of Drac-
ula's castle cut the sky. For we were so deep under the hill
whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the Car-
pathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its
grandeur, perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer
precipice, and with seemingly a great gap between it and the
steep of the adjacent mountain on any side. There was some-
thing wild and uncanny about the place. We could hear the
distant howling of wolves. They were far off, but the sound,
even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall,
was full of terror. I knew from the way Dr. Van Helsing was
searching about that he was trying to seek some strategic
point, where we would be less exposed in case of attack. The
rough roadway still led downwards. We could trace it through
the drifted snow.

In a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I
got up and joined him. He had found a wonderful spot, a sort
of natural hollow in a rock, with an entrance like a doorway
between two boulders. He took me by the hand and drew me in.

"See!" he said, "here you will be in shelter. And if the
wolves do come I can meet them one by one."

He brought in our furs, and made a snug nest for me, and
got out some provisions and forced them upon me. But I could
not eat, to even try to do so was repulsive to me, and much
as I would have liked to please him, I could not bring myself
to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did not reproach me.
Taking his field glasses from the case, he stood on the top
of the rock, and began to search the horizon.

Suddenly he called out, "Look! Madam Mina, look! Look!"

I sprang up and stood beside him on the rock. He handed
me his glasses and pointed. The snow was now falling more
heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was be-
ginning to blow. However, there were times when there were
pauses between the snow flurries and I could see a long way
round. From the height where we were it was possible to see
a great distance. And far off, beyond the white waste of
snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in
kinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us
and not far off, in fact so near that I wondered we had not
noticed before, came a group of mounted men hurrying along.
In the midst of them was a cart, a long leiter wagon which
swept from side to side, like a dog's tail wagging, with each
stern inequality of the road. Outlined against the snow as
they were, I could see from the men's clothes that they were
peasants or gypsies of some kind.

On the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped
as I saw it, for I felt that the end was coming. The evening
was now drawing close, and well I knew that at sunset the
Thing, which was till then imprisoned there, would take new
freedom and could in any of many forms elude pursuit. In fear
I turned to the Professor. To my consternation, however, he
was not there. An instant later, I saw him below me. Round
the rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter
in last night.

When he had completed it he stood beside me again say-
ing, "At least you shall be safe here from him!" He took the
glasses from me, and at the next lull of the snow swept the
whole space below us. "See," he said, "they come quickly. They
are flogging the horses, and galloping as hard as they can."

He paused and went on in a hollow voice, "They are rac-
ing for the sunset. We may be too late. God's will be done!"
Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the
whole landscape was blotted out. It soon passed, however,
and once more his glasses were fixed on the plain.

Then came a sudden cry, "Look! Look! Look! See, two
horsemen follow fast, coming up from the south. It must be
Quincey and John. Take the glass. Look before the snow blots
it all out!" I took it and looked. The two men might be Dr.
Seward and Mr. Morris. I knew at all events that neither of
them was Jonathan. At the same time I knew that Jonathan was
not far off. Looking around I saw on the north side of the
coming party two other men, riding at breakneck speed. One
of them I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took, of course,
to be Lord Godalming. They too, were pursuing the party with
the cart. When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like
a schoolboy, and after looking intently till a snow fall
made sight impossible, he laid his Winchester rifle ready for
use against the boulder at the opening of our shelter.

"They are all converging," he said."When the time comes
we shall have gypsies on all sides." I got out my revolver
ready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of
wolves came louder and closer. When the snow storm abated a
moment we looked again. It was strange to see the snow fall-
ing in such heavy flakes close to us, and beyond, the sun
shining more and more brightly as it sank down towards the
far mountain tops. Sweeping the glass all around us I could
see here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes
and larger numbers. The wolves were gathering for their prey.

Every instant seemed an age whilst we waited. The wind
came now in fierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury
as it swept upon us in circling eddies. At times we could
not see an arm's length before us. But at others, as the
hollow sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to clear the air
space around us so that we could see afar off. We had of
late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that
we knew with fair accuracy when it would be.  And we knew that
before long the sun would set. It was hard to believe that
by our watches it was less than an hour that we waited in
that rocky shelter before the various bodies began to con-
verge close upon us. The wind came now with fiercer and more
bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seemingly
had driven the snow clouds from us, for with only occasional
bursts, the snow fell. We could distinguish clearly the
individuals of each party, the pursued and the pursuers.
Strangely enough those pursued did not seem to realize, or
at least to care, that they were pursued. They seemed, how-
ever, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower
and lower on the mountain tops.

Closer and closer they drew. The Professor and I crouc-
hed down behind our rock, and held our weapons ready. I
could see that he was determined that they should not pass.
One and all were quite unaware of our presence.

All at once two voices shouted out to, "Halt!" One was
my Jonathan's, raised in a high key of passion. The other Mr.
Morris' strong resolute tone of quiet command. The gypsies
may not have known the language, but there was no mistaking
the tone, in whatever tongue the words were spoken. Instinc-
tively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalming and
Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris
on the other. The leader of the gypsies, a splendid looking
fellow who sat his horse like a centaur, waved them back, and
in a fierce voice gave to his companions some word to pro-
ceed. They lashed the horses which sprang forward. But the
four men raised their Winchester rifles, and in an unmistak-
able way commanded them to stop. At the same moment Dr. Van
Helsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons
at them. Seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened
their reins and drew up. The leader turned to them and gave
a word at which every man of the gypsy party drew what wea-
pon he carried, knife or pistol, and held himself in readiness
to attack. Issue was joined in an instant.

The leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his
horse out in front, and pointed first to the sun, now close
down on the hill tops, and then to the castle, said something
which I did not understand. For answer, all four men of our
party threw themselves from their horses and dashed towards
the cart. I should have felt terrible fear at seeing Jona-
than in such danger, but that the ardor of battle must have
been upon me as well as the rest of them. I felt no fear,
but only a wild, surging desire to do something. Seeing the
quick movement of our parties, the leader of the gypsies gave
a command. His men instantly formed round the cart in a sort
of undisciplined endeavor, each one shouldering and pushing
the other in his eagerness to carry out the order.

In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one
side of the ring of men, and Quincey on the other, were
forcing a way to the cart. It was evident that they were
bent on finishing their task before the sun should set. Noth-
ing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the level-
led weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front,
nor the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even
attract their attention. Jonathan's impetuosity, and the
manifest singleness of his purpose, seemed to overawe those
in front of him. Instinctively they cowered aside and let
him pass. In an instant he had jumped upon the cart, and with
a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great box, and
flung it over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime, Mr.
Morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the
ring of Szgany.  All the time I had been breathlessly watching
Jonathan I had, with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing
desperately forward, and had seen the knives of the gypsies
flash as he won a way through them, and they cut at him. He
had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first I
thought that he too had come through in safety. But as he
sprang beside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart,
I could see that with his left hand he was clutching at his
side, and that the blood was spurting through his fingers. He
did not delay notwithstanding this, for as Jonathan, with
desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest, attempting
to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked
the other frantically with his bowie. Under the efforts of
both men the lid began to yield. The nails drew with a
screeching sound, and the top of the box was thrown back.

By this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by
the Winchesters, and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr.
Seward, had given in and made no further resistance. The sun
was almost down on the mountain tops, and the shadows of the
whole group fell upon the snow. I saw the Count lying within
the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from
the cart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, just
like a waxen image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible
vindictive look which I knew so well.

As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look
of hate in them turned to triumph.

But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jona-
than's great knife. I shrieked as I saw it shear through the
throat. Whilst at the same moment Mr. Morris's bowie knife
plunged into the heart.

It was like a miracle, but before our very eyes, and
almost in the drawing of a breath, the whole body crumbled
into dust and passed from our sight.

I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that
moment of final dissolution, there was in the face a look of
peace, such as I never could have imagined might have rested
there.

The Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky,
and every stone of its broken battlements was articulated
against the light of the setting sun.

The gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the
extraordinary disappearance of the dead man, turned, without
a word, and rode away as if for their lives. Those who were
unmounted jumped upon the leiter wagon and shouted to the
horsemen not to desert them. The wolves, which had withdrawn
to a safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving us alone.

Mr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his
elbow, holding his hand pressed to his side. The blood still
gushed through his fingers. I flew to him, for the Holy circle
did not now keep me back, so did the two doctors. Jonathan
knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his head on
his shoulder. With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort, my
hand in that of his own which was unstained.

He must have seen the anguish of my heart in my face,
for he smiled at me and said, "I am only too happy to have
been of service! Oh, God!" he cried suddenly, struggling to
a sitting posture and pointing to me. "It was worth for this
to die! Look! Look!"

The sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and
the red gleams fell upon my face, so that it was bathed in
rosy light. With one impulse the men sank on their knees
and a deep and earnest "Amen" broke from all as their eyes
followed the pointing of his finger.

The dying man spoke, "Now God be thanked that all has
not been in vain! See! The snow is not more stainless than
her forehead! The curse has passed away!"

And, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence,
he died, a gallant gentleman.





NOTE


Seven years ago we all went through the flames. And
the happiness of some of us since then is, we think, well
worth the pain we endured. It is an added joy to Mina and
to me that our boy's birthday is the same day as that on
which Quincey Morris died. His mother holds, I know, the
secret belief that some of our brave friend's spirit has
passed into him. His bundle of names links all our little
band of men together. But we call him Quincey.

In the summer of this year we made a journey to Transyl-
vania, and went over the old ground which was, and is, to us
so full of vivid and terrible memories. It was almost imposs-
ible to believe that the things which we had seen with our
own eyes and heard with our own ears were living truths.
Every trace of all that had been was blotted out. The castle
stood as before, reared high above a waste of desolation.

When we got home we were talking of the old time, which
we could all look back on without despair, for Godalming and
Seward are both happily married. I took the papers from the
safe where they had been ever since our return so long ago.
We were struck with the fact, that in all the mass of mater-
ial of which the record is composed, there is hardly one
authentic document. Nothing but a mass of typewriting, except
the later notebooks of Mina and Seward and myself, and Van
Helsing's memorandum. We could hardly ask any one, even did
we wish to, to accept these as proofs of so wild a story.
Van Helsing summed it all up as he said, with our boy on his
knee.

"We want no proofs. We ask none to believe us! This boy
will some day know what a brave and gallant woman his mother
is. Already he knows her sweetness and loving care. Later
on he will understand how some men so loved her, that they
did dare much for her sake.
